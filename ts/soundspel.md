Would you like to organise a coding club workshop or contribute a tutorial? we are very happy to share our tutorials! Feel free to get in touch and we can help you organise a workshop at your home institution. We would also be thrilled if you are keen to develop new tutorials! Here you can find more information about how to contribute to coding club.

We would love to extend Coding Club beyond the University of Edinburgh and create a supportive community of people keen to get better at coding and statistics! So far we have organised workshops in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and St Andrews, and we are excited for Coding Club's future adventures.

We would be thrilled to have people from anywhere in the world use our tutorials! If you would like to organise a Coding Club workshop, please get in touch at ourcodingclub(at)gmail.com and we can share our advice and experience and answer any questions you might have. The workshop can take whatever format you consider suitable: people can get together and collectively go through a given tutorial, or you can lead a workshop for your lab group or department.
