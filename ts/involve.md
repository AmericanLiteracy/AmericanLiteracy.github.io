Would you like to organise a coding club workshop or contribute a tutorial? we are very happy to share our tutorials! Feel free to get in touch and we can help you organise a workshop at your home institution. We would also be thrilled if you are keen to develop new tutorials! Here you can find more information about how to contribute to coding club.

We would love to extend Coding Club beyond the University of Edinburgh and create a supportive community of people keen to get better at coding and statistics! So far we have organised workshops in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and St Andrews, and we are excited for Coding Club's future adventures.

We would be thrilled to have people from anywhere in the world use our tutorials! If you would like to organise a Coding Club workshop, please get in touch at ourcodingclub(at)gmail.com and we can share our advice and experience and answer any questions you might have. The workshop can take whatever format you consider suitable: people can get together and collectively go through a given tutorial, or you can lead a workshop for your lab group or department.

## Contribute a tutorial

Are you keen to share some of your coding and statistics knowledge? We would love to have more people join our team and build a world-wide community of people teaching and learning together! You can take a look at the [tutorials we have already developed](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/). Feel free to make suggestions for changes on existing tutorials and get in touch with us at ourcodingclub(at)gmail.com if you would like to make a new tutorial.

We have put together a [guide to contributing tutorials](https://github.com/ourcodingclub/tutorials-in-progress/blob/master/Tutorial_publishing_guide.md), where we have explained how we prepare our tutorials and how we upload them on GitHub. You can either develop a tutorial on your own or you could team up with some of your peers or us! There are no requirements on length or restrictions on topics. If you have ideas about useful coding and statistics skills and would like to share them, we can help you turn them into a tutorial. Feel free to get in touch with any questions!
