            <h2>SoundSpel is based on simple, familiar rules</h2>
          </div>
            <ol>
            <li><h3>
 Short vowels are a single letter, as in: 
  sat, set, did, dot, cut
            </h3><li><h3>
 Long vowels are followed immediately 
  by an e, as in: sundae, see, die, toe, cue
            </h3><li><h3>
 No silent letters
            </h3><li><h3>
 Most double letters are removed
            </h3><li><h3>
 Consonants such as f, s, j have a 
  consistent, single sound and spelling:\\
  tough, phone, city, judge, gorgeous\\
  → tuf, foen, sity, juj, gorjus
            </h3>
            </ol>
          <div class="section-title">

          <h3>Foerscor and seven yeers ago our
faathers braut forth, on this
continent, a nue naeshon, conseevd in
liberty and dedicaeted to th propozishon that all men ar creaeted eeqal. Now we ar engaejd in a graet sivil wor, testing whether that
naeshon, or eny naeshon so conseevd, and so dedicaeted, can long enduur. We ar met on a graet batl-feeld in 
that wor. We hav cum to dedicaet a porshon of that feeld, as a fienal resting-plaess for thoes hoo heer gaev thaer lievs, that that naeshon miet liv.  It is aultogether fiting and proper that we shuud do this, but in 
a larjer senss we cannot dedicaet, we cannot consecraet, we cannot halo
this ground. Th braev men, living and ded, hoo strugld heer, hav 
consecraeted it far abuv our puur 
power to ad or detrakt. Th wurld 
wil litl noet, nor long remember, 
whot we say heer, but it can never forget whot thae did heer. It is for 
us th living, rather, to be 
dedicaeted to th graet task remaening befor us that from thees onord 
ded we taek increest devoeshon to 
that cauz for which thay gaev th 
last fuul mezher of devoeshon - that 
we heer hiely rezolv that thees 
ded shal not hav died in vaen, 
that this naeshon, under God, shal 
hav a nue burth of freedom, and that guvernment of th peepl, bi th 
peepl, for th peepl, shal not 
perrish frum th urth.
