      CHAPTER I.
    </p>
    <p>
      U don’t noe about me without u hav red a buuk bi th naem of
      Th Advenchers of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no mater. That
      buuk was maed bi Mr. Mark Twaen, and he toeld th trooth, maenly. Thair
      was things which he strecht, but maenly he toeld th trooth. That is
      nuthing. I never seen enybody but lied wun tiem or anuther, without
      it was Ant Polly, or th wido, or maybe Mary. Ant Polly—Tom’s
      Ant Polly, she is—and Mary, and th Wido Douglas is all toeld about
      in that buuk, which is moestly a troo buuk, with sum stretchers, as I sed
      befor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now th way that th buuk wiends up is this: Tom and me found th
      muny that th robers hid in th caev, and it maed us rich. We got
      six thouzand dolars apees—all goeld. It was an awful siet of
      muny when it was pield up. Wel, Juj Thatcher he tuuk it and puut
      it out at interest, and it fetched us a dolar a day apees all th yeer
      round—mor than a body cuud tel whut to do with. Th Wido
      Douglas she tuuk me for her sun, and alowd she wuud sivilize me; but it
      was ruf living in th hous all th tiem, considering how dizmal reguelar
      and deesent th wido was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t
      stand it no longger I lit out. I got into mi oeld rags and mi
      shuugar-hogzhed agen, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he
      hunted me up and sed he was going to start a band of robers, and I miet
      join if I wuud go bak to th wido and be respectabl. So I went
      bak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th wido she cried oever me, and calld me a pur lost lam, and she
      calld me a lot of uther naems, too, but she never ment no harm bi it.
      She puut me in them nue cloeths agen, and I couldn’t do nuthing but
      swet and swet, and feel all cramped up. Wel, then, th oeld thing
      comenst agen. Th wido rung a bel for super, and u had to
      cum to tiem. When u got to th taebl u couldn’t go riet to
      eeting, but u had to waet for th wido to tuk doun her hed and
      grumbl a litl oever th victuals, tho thair worn’t reealy
      enything th mater with them,—that is, nuthing oenly evrything was
      cuukt bi itself. In a barrel of ods and ends it is diferent;
      things get mixt up, and th joos kiend of swaps around, and th things go
      beter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After super she got out her buuk and lernd me about Moses and th
      Bulrushers, and I was in a swet to fiend out all about him; but bi and bi
      she let it out that Moses had bin ded a considerabl long tiem; so then
      I didn’t cair no mor about him, becauz I don’t taek no stok
      in ded peepl.

    </p>
    <p>
      Prity soon I wonted to smoek, and askt th wido to let me. But
      she wouldn’t. She sed it was a meen practis and wasn’t
      cleen, and I must tri to not do it eny mor. That is just th way
      with sum peepl. Thay get doun on a thing when thay don’t
      noe nuthing about it. Heer she was a-bothering about Moses, which
      was no kin to her, and no ues to enybody, being gon, u see, yet fiending
      a power of fallt with me for doing a thing that had sum guud in it.
      And she tuuk snuff, too; of cors that was all riet, becauz she
      dun it herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister, Mis Watson, a tolerabl slim oeld maed, with gogls on, had
      just cum to liv with her, and tuuk a set at me now with a speling-buuk.
      She werkt me midling hard for about an our, and then th wido maed her
      eez up. I couldn’t stuud it much longger. Then for an
      our it was dedly dul, and I was fijety. Mis Watson wuud say,
      “Don’t puut yur feet up thair, Huklberry;” and “Don’t
      scrunch up liek that, Huklberry—set up straet;” and prity
      soon she wuud say, “Don’t gap and strech liek that,
      Huklberry—whi don’t u tri to behaev?” Then she
      toeld me all about th bad plaes, and I sed I wisht I was thair. She got
      mad then, but I didn’t meen no harm. All I wonted was to go
      somewheres; all I wonted was a chaenj, I worn’t particuelar. She
      sed it was wiked to say whut I sed; sed she wouldn’t say it for
      th hoel werld; she was going to liv so as to go to th guud plaes.
      Wel, I couldn’t see no advantej in going whair she was
      going, so I maed up mi miend I wouldn’t tri for it. But I never
      sed so, becauz it wuud oenly maek trubl, and wouldn’t do no
      guud.

    <p>
      Now she had got a start, and she went on and toeld me all about th guud
      plaes. She sed all a body wuud hav to do thair was to go around
      all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn’t
      think much of it. But I never sed so. I askt her if she rekond
      Tom Sawyer wuud go thair, and she sed not bi a considerabl siet.
      I was glad about that, becauz I wonted him and me to be together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mis Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiersum and loensum.
      Bi and bi thay fetched th niggers in and had prairs, and then
      evrybody was off to bed. I went up to mi room with a pees of
      candl, and puut it on th taebl. Then I set doun in a chair bi th
      windo and tried to think of sumthing cheerful, but it worn’t no
      ues. I felt so loensum I moest wisht I was ded. Th stars
      wer shiening, and th leevs rusld in th wuuds ever so mornful; and I
      herd an oul, away off, hoo-whooing about sumbody that was ded, and a
      whippowill and a daug crieing about sumbody that was going to die; and th
      wiend was trieing to whisper sumthing to me, and I couldn’t maek out
      whut it was, and so it maed th coeld shivers run oever me. Then away out in
      th wuuds I herd that kiend of a sound that a goest maeks when it wonts to
      tel about sumthing that’s on its miend and can’t maek itself
      understuud, and so can’t rest eezy in its graev, and has to go about
      that way evry niet greeving. I got so doun-hearted and scaird I
      did wish I had sum cumpany. Prity soon a spieder went cralling up
      mi shoelder, and I flipt it off and it lit in th candl; and befor I
      cuud buj it was all shriveld up. I didn’t need enybody to
      tel me that that was an awful bad sien and wuud fech me sum bad luk,
      so I was scaird and moest shuuk th cloeths off of me. I got up and ternd
      around in mi traks three tiems and crosst mi brest evry tiem; and then
      I tied up a litl lok of mi hair with a thred to keep wiches away.
      But I hadn’t no confidens. U do that when u’ve
      lost a hors-shoo that u’ve found, insted of naeling it up oever
      th dor, but I hadn’t ever herd enybody say it was eny way to keep
      off bad luk when u’d kild a spieder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I set doun agen, a-shaeking all oever, and got out mi piep for a smoek; for
      th hous was all as stil as deth now, and so th wido wouldn’t
      noe. Wel, after a long tiem I herd th clok away off in th toun go
      boom—boom—boom—twelv licks; and all stil agen—stiller
      than ever. Prity soon I herd a twig snap doun in th dark amungst th
      trees—sumthing was a stering. I set stil and lisend.
      Directly I cuud just bairly heer a “me-yow! me-yow!”
      doun thair. That was guud! Sez I, “me-yow! me-yow!”
      as sofft as I cuud, and then I puut out th liet and scrambld out of th
      windo on to th shed. Then I slipt doun to th ground and cralld
      in amung th trees, and, shur enuf, thair was Tom Sawyer waeting for me.

      <br> <br> CHAPTER II.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went tiptoeing along a path amungst th trees bak tords th end of
      th wido’s garden, stooping doun so as th branches wouldn’t
      scraep our heds. When we was pasing bi th kichen I fel oever a root
      and maed a noiz. We scrouched doun and laed stil. Mis
      Watson’s big nigger, naemd Jim, was seting in th kichen dor; we
      cuud see him prity cleer, becauz thair was a liet behiend him. He
      got up and strecht his nek out about a minit, lisening. Then he
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoo dah?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He lisend sum mor; then he cum tiptoeing doun and stuud riet between
      us; we cuud a tucht him, neerly. Wel, liekly it was minits and
      minits that thair worn’t a sound, and we all thair so cloez
      together. Thair was a plaes on mi ankl that got to iching, but I
      dasn’t scrach it; and then mi eer begun to ich; and next mi bak,
      riet between mi shoelders. Seemd liek I’d die if I couldn’t
      scrach. Wel, I’ve noetist that thing plenty tiems sinss.
      If u ar with th qolity, or at a fueneral, or trieing to go to
      sleep when u ain’t sleepy—if u ar anywheres whair it wun’t
      do for u to scrach, whi u wil ich all oever in upwards of a thouzand
      plaeses. Prity soon Jim sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say, hoo is u? Whar is u? Daug mi cats ef I didn’ 
      heer sumf’n. Wel, I noe whut I’s gwyne to do: I’s
      gwyne to set doun heer and lisen tel I heers it agin.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <a name="c02-24" id="c02-24"></a><br> <br>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      So he set doun on th ground betwixt me and Tom. He leend his bak
      up agenst a tree, and strecht his legs out til wun of them moest
      tucht wun of mien. Mi noez begun to ich. It itched til th
      teers cum into mi ies. But I dasn’t scrach. Then it
      begun to ich on th insied. Next I got to iching underneeth. I
      didn’t noe how I was going to set stil. This miserableness went on
      as much as six or seven minits; but it seemd a siet longger than that.
      I was iching in eleven diferent plaeses now. I rekond I
      couldn’t stand it mor’n a minit longger, but I set mi teeth
      hard and got redy to tri. Just then Jim begun to breeth hevy;
      next he begun to snor—and then I was prity soon cumfortabl agen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom he maed a sien to me—kiend of a litl noiz with his mouth—and
      we went creeping away on our hands and nees. When we was ten fuut
      off Tom whisperd to me, and wonted to tee Jim to th tree for fun. But
      I sed no; he miet waek and maek a disterbans, and then thay’d
      fiend out I worn’t in. Then Tom sed he hadn’t got candls
      enuf, and he wuud slip in th kichen and get sum mor. I didn’t
      wont him to tri. I sed Jim miet waek up and cum. But Tom
      wonted to resk it; so we slid in thair and got three candls, and Tom laed
      fiev sents on th taebl for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a swet to
      get away; but nuthing wuud do Tom but he must crall to whair Jim was, on
      his hands and nees, and play sumthing on him. I waeted, and it
      seemd a guud whiel, evrything was so stil and loensum.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Tom was bak we cut along th path, around th garden fens,
      and bi and bi fetched up on th steep top of th hil th uther sied of
      th hous. Tom sed he slipt Jim’s hat off of his hed and
      hung it on a lim riet oever him, and Jim sterd a litl, but he didn’t
      waek. Afterwards Jim sed th wiches be witched him and puut him in a
      trans, and roed him all oever th Staet, and then set him under th trees
      agen, and hung his hat on a lim to sho hoo dun it. And next tiem
      Jim toeld it he sed thay roed him doun to Nue Orleans; and, after that,
      evry tiem he toeld it he spred it mor and mor, til bi and bi he sed
      thay roed him all oever th werld, and tierd him moest to deth, and his
      bak was all oever sadl-boils. Jim was monstrus proud about it,
      and he got so he wouldn’t hardly noetis th uther niggers. Niggers
      wuud cum miels to heer Jim tel about it, and he was mor luukt up to
      than eny nigger in that cuntry. Straenj niggers wuud stand with
      thair mouths oepen and luuk him all oever, saem as if he was a wunder.
      Niggers is allways tauking about wiches in th dark bi th kichen
      fier; but whenever wun was tauking and leting on to noe all about such
      things, Jim wuud hapen in and say, “Hm! Whut u noe
      ’bout wiches?” and that nigger was corkt up and had to taek
      a bak seet. Jim allways kept that fiev-senter pees round his nek
      with a string, and sed it was a charm th devil giv to him with his oen
      hands, and toeld him he cuud cuer enybody with it and fech wiches
      whenever he wonted to just bi saying sumthing to it; but he never toeld
      whut it was he sed to it. Niggers wuud cum frum all around thair
      and giv Jim enything thay had, just for a siet of that fiev-senter
      pees; but thay wouldn’t tuch it, becauz th devil had had his
      hands on it. Jim was moest rooind for a servant, becauz he got stuk
      up on acount of having seen th devil and bin roed bi wiches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, when Tom and me got to th ej of th hiltop we luukt away doun
      into th vilej and cuud see three or foer liets twinkling, whair thair
      was sik foeks, maybe; and th stars oever us was sparkling ever so fien;
      and doun bi th vilej was th river, a hoel miel braud, and awful stil
      and grand. We went doun th hil and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers,
      and too or three mor of th boys, hid in th oeld tanyard. So we
      unhicht a skif and puuld doun th river too miel and a haf, to th
      big scar on th hilsied, and went ashor.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went to a clump of buushes, and Tom maed evrybody swair to keep th
      seecret, and then shoed them a hoel in th hil, riet in th thikest
      part of th buushes. Then we lit th candls, and cralld in on our
      hands and nees. We went about too hundred yards, and then th caev
      oepend up. Tom poekt about amungst th pasejes, and prity soon dukt
      under a wall whair u wouldn’t a noetist that thair was a hoel.
      We went along a narro plaes and got into a kiend of room, all damp
      and swety and coeld, and thair we stopt. Tom sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, we’ll start this band of robers and call it Tom Sawyer’s
      Gang. Evrybody that wonts to join has got to taek an oeth, and riet his
      naem in blud.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <a name="c02-25" id="c02-25"></a><br> <br>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c02-25.jpg (68K)" src="./HuckFinn_files/c02-25.jpg" style="width:100%;"><br>
    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Evrybody was wiling. So Tom got out a sheet of paeper that he had
      roet th oeth on, and red it. It swor evry boy to stik to th
      band, and never tel eny of th seecrets; and if enybody dun enything to
      eny boy in th band, whichever boy was orderd to kil that person and his
      family must do it, and he mustn’t eet and he mustn’t sleep
      til he had kild them and hakt a cross in thair brests, which was th
      sien of th band. And noebody that didn’t belong to th band cuud
      ues that mark, and if he did he must be sood; and if he dun it agen he
      must be kild. And if enybody that belongd to th band toeld th
      seecrets, he must hav his throet cut, and then hav his carcas bernt up
      and th ashes scaterd all around, and his naem bloted off of th list
      with blud and never menshund agen bi th gang, but hav a curs puut on
      it and be forgot forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evrybody sed it was a reeal buetiful oeth, and askt Tom if he got it
      out of his oen hed. He sed, sum of it, but th rest was out of
      pieret-buuks and rober-buuks, and evry gang that was hi-toned had it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sum thaut it wuud be guud to kil th <i>familys</i> of boys that
      toeld th seecrets. Tom sed it was a guud iedeea, so he tuuk a pensil
      and roet it in. Then Ben Rogers sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heer’s Huck Finn, he hain’t got no family; whut u
      going to do ’bout him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, hain’t he got a faather?” sez Tom Sawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, he’s got a faather, but u can’t never fiend him
      thees days. He uezd to lay drunk with th hogs in th tanyard, but
      he hain’t bin seen in thees parts for a yeer or mor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay taukt it oever, and thay was going to rool me out, becauz thay sed
      evry boy must hav a family or sumbody to kil, or els it wouldn’t
      be fair and sqair for th uthers. Wel, noebody cuud think of
      enything to do—evrybody was stumpt, and set stil. I was
      moest redy to cri; but all at wuns I thaut of a way, and so I offerd
      them Mis Watson—thay cuud kil her. Evrybody sed:
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, she’ll do. That’s all riet. Huck can
      cum in.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then thay all stuk a pin in thair finggers to get blud to sien with, and
      I maed mi mark on th paeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” sez Ben Rogers, “whut’s th lien of
      biznes of this Gang?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nuthing oenly robery and merder,” Tom sed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But hoo ar we going to rob?—houses, or catl, or—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stuf! steeling catl and such things ain’t robery; it’s
      berglary,” sez Tom Sawyer. “We ain’t berglars. That
      ain’t no sort of stiel. We ar highwaymen. We stop
      staejes and carrejes on th roed, with masks on, and kil th peepl and
      taek thair woches and muny.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Must we allways kil th peepl?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, sertenly. It’s best. Sum authoritys think
      diferent, but moestly it’s considerd best to kil them—exsept
      sum that u bring to th caev heer, and keep them til thay’re
      ransomed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ransomed? Whut’s that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t noe. But that’s whut thay do. I’ve
      seen it in buuks; and so of cors that’s whut we’ve got to
      do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But how can we do it if we don’t noe whut it is?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, blaem it all, we’ve <i>got</i> to do it. Don’t
      I tel u it’s in th buuks? Do u wont to go to doing
      diferent frum whut’s in th buuks, and get things all muddled up?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, that’s all verry fien to <i>say</i>, Tom Sawyer, but how
      in th naeshun ar thees feloes going to be ransomed if we don’t
      noe how to do it to them?—that’s th thing I wont to get at.
      Now, whut do u rekon it is?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I don’t noe. But per’aps if we keep them
      til thay’re ransomed, it meens that we keep them til thay’re
      ded.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, that’s sumthing <i>liek</i>. That’ll
      anser. Whi couldn’t u sed that befor? We’ll
      keep them til thay’re ransomed to deth; and a bothersum lot thay’ll
      be, too—eeting up evrything, and allways trieing to get loos.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How u tauk, Ben Rogers. How can thay get loos when thair’s
      a gard oever them, redy to shoot them doun if thay moov a peg?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A gard! Wel, that <i>is</i> guud. So sumbody’s
      got to set up all niet and never get eny sleep, just so as to woch them.
      I think that’s foolishnes. Whi can’t a body taek a club
      and ransum them as soon as thay get heer?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Becauz it ain’t in th buuks so—that’s whi.
      Now, Ben Rogers, do u wont to do things reguelar, or don’t
      u?—that’s th iedeea. Don’t u rekon that th
      peepl that maed th buuks noes whut’s th corect thing to do?
      Do u rekon <i>u</i> can lern ’em enything? Not bi
      a guud deel. No, ser, we’ll just go on and ransum them in th
      reguelar way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet. I don’t miend; but I say it’s a fool
      way, enyhow. Say, do we kil th wimen, too?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as u I wouldn’t let
      on. Kil th wimen? No; noebody ever saw enything in th buuks
      liek that. U fech them to th caev, and u’re allways as
      poliet as pi to them; and bi and bi thay fall in luv with u, and never
      wont to go hoem eny mor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, if that’s th way I’m agreed, but I don’t
      taek no stok in it. Miety soon we’ll hav th caev so cluterd up
      with wimen, and feloes waeting to be ransomed, that thair wun’t be
      no plaes for th robers. But go ahed, I ain’t got nuthing to say.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Litl Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when thay waekt him up he was
      scaird, and cried, and sed he wonted to go hoem to his maa, and didn’t
      wont to be a rober eny mor.
    </p>
    <p>
      So thay all maed fun of him, and calld him cri-baeby, and that maed him
      mad, and he sed he wuud go straet and tel all th seecrets. But
      Tom giv him fiev sents to keep qieet, and sed we wuud all go hoem and
      meet next week, and rob sumbody and kil sum peepl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben Rogers sed he couldn’t get out much, oenly Sundays, and so he
      wonted to begin next Sunday; but all th boys sed it wuud be wiked to
      do it on Sunday, and that setld th thing. Thay agreed to get
      together and fix a day as soon as thay cuud, and then we elected Tom
      Sawyer ferst capten and Jo Harper second capten of th Gang, and so
      started hoem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I clumb up th shed and crept into mi windo just befor day was braeking.
      Mi nue cloeths was all greest up and clayey, and I was daug-tierd.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER III.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, I got a guud going-oever in th morning frum oeld Mis Watson on
      acount of mi cloeths; but th wido she didn’t scoeld, but oenly
      cleend off th grees and clay, and luukt so sorry that I thaut I
      wuud behaev awhiel if I cuud. Then Mis Watson she tuuk me in th
      clozet and prayd, but nuthing cum of it. She toeld me to pray evry
      day, and whutever I askt for I wuud get it. But it worn’t
      so. I tried it. Wuns I got a fish-lien, but no huuks. It worn’t
      eny guud to me without huuks. I tried for th huuks three or foer
      tiems, but sumhow I couldn’t maek it werk. Bi and bi, wun
      day, I askt Mis Watson to tri for me, but she sed I was a fool. She
      never toeld me whi, and I couldn’t maek it out no way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I set doun wun tiem bak in th wuuds, and had a long think about it.
      I sez to mieself, if a body can get enything thay pray for, whi don’t
      Deecon Winn get bak th muny he lost on pork? Whi can’t th
      wido get bak her silver snufbox that was stoel? Whi can’t
      Mis Watson fat up? No, sez I to mi self, thair ain’t nuthing in
      it. I went and toeld th wido about it, and she sed th thing a
      body cuud get bi praying for it was “spirichual gifts.” This
      was too meny for me, but she toeld me whut she ment—I must help
      uther peepl, and do evrything I cuud for uther peepl, and luuk out for
      them all th tiem, and never think about mieself. This was inclooding Mis
      Watson, as I tuuk it. I went out in th wuuds and ternd it oever in
      mi miend a long tiem, but I couldn’t see no advantej about it—exsept
      for th uther peepl; so at last I rekond I wouldn’t wery about
      it eny mor, but just let it go. Sumtiems th wido wuud taek me
      wun sied and tauk about Providens in a way to maek a body’s mouth
      wauter; but maybe next day Mis Watson wuud taek hoeld and nok it all
      doun agen. I jujd I cuud see that thair was too Providenses, and
      a pur chap wuud stand considerabl sho with th wido’s
      Providens, but if Mis Watson’s got him thair worn’t no help
      for him eny mor. I thaut it all out, and rekond I wuud belong
      to th wido’s if he wonted me, tho I couldn’t maek out how
      he was a-going to be eny beter off then than whut he was befor, seeing I
      was so ignorant, and so kiend of lo-doun and ornery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pap he hadn’t bin seen for mor than a yeer, and that was
      cumfortabl for me; I didn’t wont to see him no mor. He uezd
      to allways whael me when he was soeber and cuud get his hands on me; tho
      I uezd to taek to th wuuds moest of th tiem when he was around. Wel,
      about this tiem he was found in th river drownded, about twelv miel
      abuv toun, so peepl sed. Thay jujd it was him, enyway; sed
      this drownded man was just his siez, and was raged, and had uncomon long
      hair, which was all liek pap; but thay couldn’t maek nuthing out of
      th faes, becauz it had bin in th wauter so long it worn’t much
      liek a faes at all. Thay sed he was floeting on his bak in th
      wauter. Thay tuuk him and berryd him on th bank. But I worn’t
      cumfortabl long, becauz I hapend to think of sumthing. I knowed
      miety wel that a drownded man don’t floet on his bak, but on his
      faes. So I knowed, then, that this worn’t pap, but a wuuman
      drest up in a man’s cloeths. So I was uncumfortabl agen.
      I jujd th oeld man wuud tern up agen bi and bi, tho I wisht
      he wouldn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      We playd rober now and then about a munth, and then I reziend. All
      th boys did. We hadn’t robd noebody, hadn’t kild eny
      peepl, but oenly just pretended. We uezd to hop out of th wuuds and
      go charjing doun on hog-drievers and wimen in carts taeking garden stuf to
      market, but we never hived eny of them. Tom Sawyer calld th hogs
      “ingots,” and he calld th ternips and stuf “julery,”
      and we wuud go to th caev and powwow oever whut we had dun, and how meny
      peepl we had kild and markt. But I couldn’t see no profit
      in it. Wun tiem Tom sent a boy to run about toun with a blaezing
      stik, which he calld a sloegan (which was th sien for th Gang to get
      together), and then he sed he had got seecret nues bi his spies that next
      day a hoel parsel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp
      in Caev Holo with too hundred elefants, and six hundred camels, and
      oever a thouzand “sumter” muels, all loeded doun with di’monds,
      and thay didn’t hav oenly a gard of foer hundred soeljers, and so
      we wuud lay in ambuscaed, as he calld it, and kil th lot and scoop th
      things. He sed we must slik up our sords and guns, and get redy.
      He never cuud go after eeven a ternip-cart but he must hav th
      sords and guns all scourd up for it, tho thay was oenly lath and
      broomsticks, and u miet scour at them til u rotted, and then thay
      worn’t werth a mouthful of ashes mor than whut thay was befor.
      I didn’t beleev we cuud lik such a croud of Spaniards and
      A-rabs, but I wonted to see th camels and elefants, so I was on hand
      next day, Saturday, in th ambuscaed; and when we got th werd we rusht
      out of th wuuds and doun th hil. But thair worn’t no
      Spaniards and A-rabs, and thair worn’t no camels nor no elefants.
      It worn’t enything but a Sunday-scool picnik, and oenly a
      primer-clas at that. We busted it up, and chaest th children up
      th holo; but we never got enything but sum doughnuts and jam, tho
      Ben Rogers got a rag dol, and Jo Harper got a him-buuk and a tract; and
      then th teecher charjd in, and maed us drop evrything and cut.

    <p>
      I didn’t see no di’monds, and I toeld Tom Sawyer so.
      He sed thair was loeds of them thair, enyway; and he sed thair was
      A-rabs thair, too, and elefants and things. I sed, whi couldn’t
      we see them, then? He sed if I worn’t so ignorant, but had
      red a buuk calld Don Quixote, I wuud noe without asking. He sed
      it was all dun bi enchantment. He sed thair was hundreds of
      soeljers thair, and elefants and trezher, and so on, but we had enemys
      which he calld majishans; and thay had ternd th hoel thing into an
      infant Sunday-scool, just out of spiet. I sed, all riet; then th
      thing for us to do was to go for th majishans. Tom Sawyer sed I
      was a numskul.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi,” sed he, “a majishan cuud call up a lot of
      genies, and thay wuud hash u up liek nuthing befor u cuud say Jak
      Robinson. Thay ar as tall as a tree and as big around as a cherch.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” I sez, “s’poez we got sum genies to help
      <i>us</i>—can’t we lik th uther croud then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How u going to get them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t noe. How do <i>thay</i> get them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, thay rub an oeld tin lamp or an ieern ring, and then th genies
      cum tairing in, with th thunder and lietning a-riping around and th
      smoek a-roeling, and evrything thay’re toeld to do thay up and do
      it. Thay don’t think nuthing of puuling a shot-tower up bi th
      roots, and belting a Sunday-scool superintendent oever th hed with it—or
      eny uther man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoo maeks them teer around so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, hooever rubs th lamp or th ring. Thay belong to
      hooever rubs th lamp or th ring, and thay’ve got to do whutever he
      sez. If he tels them to bild a palas forty miels long out of di’monds,
      and fil it fuul of chooing-gum, or whutever u wont, and fech an
      emperor’s dauter frum Chiena for u to marry, thay’ve got to
      do it—and thay’ve got to do it befor sun-up next morning,
      too. And mor: thay’ve got to wallts that palas around
      oever th cuntry whairever u wont it, u understand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” sez I, “I think thay ar a pak of flat-heds
      for not keeping th palas themselvs ’sted of fooling them away
      liek that. And whut’s mor—if I was wun of them I wuud
      see a man in Jericho befor I wuud drop mi biznes and cum to him for
      th rubing of an oeld tin lamp.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How u tauk, Huck Finn. Whi, u’d <i>hav</i> to cum
      when he rubd it, whether u wonted to or not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut! and I as hi as a tree and as big as a cherch? All
      riet, then; I <i>wuud</i> cum; but I lay I’d maek that man cliem
      th hieest tree thair was in th cuntry.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shuks, it ain’t no ues to tauk to u, Huck Finn. U
      don’t seem to noe enything, sumhow—perfect saphead.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I thaut all this oever for too or three days, and then I rekond I wuud
      see if thair was enything in it. I got an oeld tin lamp and an ieern
      ring, and went out in th wuuds and rubd and rubd til I swet liek an
      Injun, calcuelaeting to bild a palas and sel it; but it worn’t no
      ues, nun of th genies cum. So then I jujd that all that stuf
      was oenly just wun of Tom Sawyer’s lies. I rekond he beleevd
      in th A-rabs and th elefants, but as for me I think diferent. It
      had all th marks of a Sunday-scool.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER IV.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, three or foer munths run along, and it was wel into th winter now.
      I had bin to scool moest all th tiem and cuud spel and red and riet
      just a litl, and cuud say th multiplicaeshun taebl up to six tiems
      seven is therty-fiev, and I don’t rekon I cuud ever get eny
      ferther than that if I was to liv forever. I don’t taek no
      stok in mathematics, enyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ferst I haeted th scool, but bi and bi I got so I cuud stand it.
      Whenever I got uncomon tierd I playd hookey, and th hieding I got next
      day dun me guud and cheerd me up. So th longger I went to scool
      th eezyer it got to be. I was geting sort of uezd to th wido’s
      ways, too, and thay worn’t so raspy on me. Living in a hous
      and sleeping in a bed puuld on me prity tiet moestly, but befor th
      coeld wether I uezd to slied out and sleep in th wuuds sumtiems, and so
      that was a rest to me. I liekt th oeld ways best, but I was geting
      so I liekt th nue wuns, too, a litl bit. Th wido sed I was cuming
      along slo but shur, and doing verry satisfactory. She sed she worn’t
      ashaemd of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wun morning I hapend to tern oever th sallt-selar at brekfast. I
      reecht for sum of it as qik as I cuud to thro oever mi left shoelder
      and keep off th bad luk, but Mis Watson was in ahed of me, and crosst
      me off. She sez, “Taek yur hands away, Huklberry; whut a mes
      u ar allways maeking!” Th wido puut in a guud werd for me,
      but that worn’t going to keep off th bad luk, I knowed that wel
      enuf. I started out, after brekfast, feeling weryd and shaeky,
      and wundering whair it was going to fall on me, and whut it was going to
      be. Thair is ways to keep off sum kiends of bad luk, but this wasn’t
      wun of them kiend; so I never tried to do enything, but just poekt along
      lo-spirited and on th woch-out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went doun to th frunt garden and clumb oever th stiel whair u go
      thru th hi bord fens. Thair was an inch of nue sno on th
      ground, and I seen sumbody’s traks. Thay had cum up frum
      th qorry and stuud around th stiel a whiel, and then went on around th
      garden fens. It was funy thay hadn’t cum in, after standing
      around so. I couldn’t maek it out. It was verry cuerius,
      sumhow. I was going to folo around, but I stoopt doun to luuk at
      th traks ferst. I didn’t noetis enything at ferst, but next
      I did. Thair was a cross in th left boot-heel maed with big naels,
      to keep off th devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was up in a second and shinning doun th hil. I luukt oever mi
      shoelder evry now and then, but I didn’t see noebody. I was at
      Juj Thatcher’s as qik as I cuud get thair. He sed:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, mi boy, u ar all out of breth. Did u cum for yur
      interest?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, ser,” I sez; “is thair sum for me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, yes, a haf-yeerly is in last niet—oever a hundred and
      fifty dolars. Qiet a forchun for u. U had beter let me
      invest it along with yur six thouzand, becauz if u taek it u’ll
      spend it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, ser,” I sez, “I don’t wont to spend it.
      I don’t wont it at all—nor th six thouzand, nuther.
      I wont u to taek it; I wont to giv it to u—th six
      thouzand and all.”
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      He luukt serpriezd. He couldn’t seem to maek it out. He
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, whut can u meen, mi boy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sez, “Don’t u ask me no qeschuns about it, pleez.
      U’ll taek it—wun’t u?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I’m puzld. Is sumthing th mater?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pleez taek it,” sez I, “and don’t ask me
      nuthing—then I wun’t hav to tel no lies.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He studyd a whiel, and then he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oho-o! I think I see. U wont to <i>sel</i> all yur
      property to me—not giv it. That’s th corect iedeea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he roet sumthing on a paeper and red it oever, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thair; u see it sez ‘for a consideraeshun.’ That
      meens I hav baut it of u and paed u for it. Heer’s a
      dolar for u. Now u sien it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So I siend it, and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mis Watson’s nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as yur fist,
      which had bin tuuk out of th foerth stumac of an ox, and he uezd to do
      majic with it. He sed thair was a spirit insied of it, and it
      knowed evrything. So I went to him that niet and toeld him pap was
      heer agen, for I found his traks in th sno. Whut I wonted to
      noe was, whut he was going to do, and was he going to stay? Jim got
      out his hair-ball and sed sumthing oever it, and then he held it up and
      dropt it on th flor. It fel prity solid, and oenly roeld about
      an inch. Jim tried it agen, and then anuther tiem, and it acted
      just th saem. Jim got doun on his nees, and puut his eer agenst it
      and lisend. But it worn’t no ues; he sed it wouldn’t
      tauk. He sed sumtiems it wouldn’t tauk without muny. I toeld
      him I had an oeld slik counterfit qorter that worn’t no guud
      becauz th bras shoed thru th silver a litl, and it wouldn’t
      pas nohow, eeven if th bras didn’t sho, becauz it was so slik
      it felt greezy, and so that wuud tel on it evry tiem. (I rekond
      I wouldn’t say nuthing about th dolar I got frum th juj.) I
      sed it was prity bad muny, but maybe th hair-ball wuud taek it,
      becauz maybe it wouldn’t noe th diferens. Jim smelt it
      and bit it and rubd it, and sed he wuud manej so th hair-ball wuud
      think it was guud. He sed he wuud split oepen a raw Irish potaeto
      and stik th qorter in between and keep it thair all niet, and next
      morning u couldn’t see no bras, and it wouldn’t feel greezy
      no mor, and so enybody in toun wuud taek it in a minit, let aloen a
      hair-ball. Wel, I knowed a potaeto wuud do that befor, but I had
      forgot it.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER V.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had shut th dor to. Then I ternd around and thair he was.
      I uezd to be scaird of him all th tiem, he tand me so much.
      I rekond I was scaird now, too; but in a minit I see I was
      mistaeken—that is, after th ferst joelt, as u may say, when mi
      breth sort of hicht, he being so unexpected; but riet away after I see
      I worn’t scaird of him werth bothring about.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was moest fifty, and he luukt it. His hair was long and tanggld
      and greezy, and hung doun, and u cuud see his ies shiening thru liek
      he was behiend viens. It was all blak, no gray; so was his long,
      mixt-up whiskers. Thair worn’t no culor in his faes, whair
      his faes shoed; it was whiet; not liek anuther man’s whiet, but a
      whiet to maek a body sik, a whiet to maek a body’s flesh crall—a
      tree-toed whiet, a fish-bely whiet. As for his cloeths—just
      rags, that was all. He had wun ankl resting on t’uther nee;
      th boot on that fuut was busted, and too of his toes stuk thru, and
      he werkt them now and then. His hat was laying on th flor—an
      oeld blak slouch with th top caevd in, liek a lid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stuud a-luuking at him; he set thair a-luuking at me, with his chair
      tilted bak a litl. I set th candl doun. I noetist th
      windo was up; so he had clumb in bi th shed. He kept a-luuking me
      all oever. Bi and bi he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Starchy cloeths—verry. U think u’re a guud
      deel of a big-bug, <i>don’t</i> u?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe I am, maybe I ain’t,” I sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t u giv me nun o’ yur lip,” sez he.
      “U’ve puut on considerabl meny frils sinss I bin away.
      I’ll taek u doun a peg befor I get dun with u. U’re
      ejucaeted, too, thay say—can red and riet. U think u’re
      beter’n yur faather, now, don’t u, becauz he can’t?
      <i>I’ll</i> taek it out of u. Hoo toeld u u miet
      medl with such hifalut’n foolishnes, hay?—hoo toeld u u
      cuud?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th wido. She toeld me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th wido, hay?—and hoo toeld th wido she cuud puut in her
      shuvel about a thing that ain’t nun of her biznes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Noebody never toeld her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I’ll lern her how to medl. And luuky heer—u
      drop that scool, u heer? I’ll lern peepl to bring up a
      boy to puut on airs oever his oen faather and let on to be beter’n
      whut <i>he</i> is. U lemme cach u fooling around that scool
      agen, u heer? Yur muther couldn’t red, and she couldn’t
      riet, nuther, befor she died. Nun of th family couldn’t
      befor <i>thay</i> died. I can’t; and heer u’re
      a-sweling yurself up liek this. I ain’t th man to stand it—u
      heer? Say, lemme heer u red.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I tuuk up a buuk and begun sumthing about Jeneral Washington and th
      wors. When I’d red about a haf a minit, he fetched th buuk a
      whak with his hand and nokt it across th hous. He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s so. U can do it. I had mi douts when u
      toeld me. Now luuky heer; u stop that puuting on frils. I
      wun’t hav it. I’ll lay for u, mi smarty; and if I
      cach u about that scool I’ll tan u guud. Ferst u noe u’ll
      get relijon, too. I never see such a sun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He tuuk up a litl bloo and yaller pikcher of sum cows and a boy, and
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut’s this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s sumthing thay giv me for lerning mi lesons guud.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He tore it up, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll giv u sumthing beter—I’ll giv u a
      cow-hied.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He set thair a-mumbling and a-grouling a minit, and then he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ain’t</i> u a sweet-sented dandy, tho? A bed;
      and bedcloeths; and a luuk’n’-glas; and a pees of carpet on
      th flor—and yur oen faather got to sleep with th hogs in th
      tanyard. I never see such a sun. I bet I’ll taek sum o’ 
      thees frils out o’ u befor I’m dun with u. Whi, thair
      ain’t no end to yur airs—thay say u’re rich. Hay?—how’s

    <p>
      “Thay lie—that’s how.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Luuky heer—miend how u tauk to me; I’m a-standing
      about all I can stand now—so don’t gimme no sass. I’ve
      bin in toun too days, and I hain’t herd nuthing but about u bein’ 
      rich. I herd about it away doun th river, too. That’s
      whi I cum. U git me that muny to-morro—I wont it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hain’t got no muny.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a lie. Juj Thatcher’s got it. U
      git it. I wont it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hain’t got no muny, I tel u. U ask Juj
      Thatcher; he’ll tel u th saem.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet. I’ll ask him; and I’ll maek him
      pungle, too, or I’ll noe th reezon whi. Say, how much u
      got in yur poket? I wont it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hain’t got oenly a dolar, and I wont that to—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It don’t maek no diferens whut u wont it for—u
      just shel it out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He tuuk it and bit it to see if it was guud, and then he sed he was going
      doun toun to get sum whisky; sed he hadn’t had a drink all day.
      When he had got out on th shed he puut his hed in agen, and cussed me
      for puuting on frils and trieing to be beter than him; and when I
      rekond he was gon he cum bak and puut his hed in agen, and toeld me
      to miend about that scool, becauz he was going to lay for me and lik me
      if I didn’t drop that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he was drunk, and he went to Juj Thatcher’s and
      bullyragged him, and tried to maek him giv up th muny; but he couldn’t,
      and then he swor he’d maek th law fors him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th juj and th wido went to law to get th cort to taek me away frum
      him and let wun of them be mi gardian; but it was a nue juj that had
      just cum, and he didn’t noe th oeld man; so he sed corts mustn’t
      interfeer and separaet familys if thay cuud help it; sed he’d
      druther not taek a chield away frum its faather. So Juj Thatcher and
      th wido had to qit on th biznes.
    </p>
    <p>
      That pleezd th oeld man til he couldn’t rest. He sed he’d
      cow-hied me til I was blak and bloo if I didn’t raez sum muny
      for him. I borroed three dolars frum Juj Thatcher, and pap tuuk
      it and got drunk, and went a-bloeing around and cussing and hooping and
      carrying on; and he kept it up all oever toun, with a tin pan, til moest
      midniet; then thay jaeld him, and next day thay had him befor cort,
      and jaeld him agen for a week. But he sed <i>he</i> was
      satisfied; sed he was boss of his sun, and he’d maek it worm for <i>him</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got out th nue juj sed he was a-going to maek a man of him. So
      he tuuk him to his oen hous, and drest him up cleen and nies, and had
      him to brekfast and diner and super with th family, and was just oeld
      pi to him, so to speek. And after super he taukt to him about
      temperans and such things til th oeld man cried, and sed he’d
      bin a fool, and foold away his lief; but now he was a-going to tern oever
      a nue leef and be a man noebody wouldn’t be ashaemd of, and he hoept
      th juj wuud help him and not luuk doun on him. Th juj sed he
      cuud hug him for them werds; so he cried, and his wief she cried agen;
      pap sed he’d bin a man that had allways bin misunderstuud befor,
      and th juj sed he beleevd it. Th oeld man sed that whut a man
      wonted that was doun was simpathy, and th juj sed it was so; so thay
      cried agen. And when it was bedtiem th oeld man roez up and held
      out his hand, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Luuk at it, jentlmen and laedys all; taek a-hoeld of it; shaek it.
      Thair’s a hand that was th hand of a hog; but it ain’t so no
      mor; it’s th hand of a man that’s started in on a nue lief,
      and’ll die befor he’ll go bak. U mark them werds—don’t
      forget I sed them. It’s a cleen hand now; shaek it—don’t
      be afeard.”

    <p>
      So thay shuuk it, wun after th uther, all around, and cried. Th
      juj’s wief she kist it. Then th oeld man he siend a
      plej—maed his mark. Th juj sed it was th holiest tiem on
      record, or sumthing liek that. Then thay tukt th oeld man into a
      buetiful room, which was th spair room, and in th niet sum tiem he
      got powerful thersty and clumb out on to th porch-roof and slid doun a
      stanshun and traeded his nue coet for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb bak
      agen and had a guud oeld tiem; and tords dayliet he cralld out agen,
      drunk as a fidler, and roeld off th porch and broek his left arm in too
      plaeses, and was moest froez to deth when sumbody found him after sun-up.
      And when thay cum to luuk at that spair room thay had to taek
      soundings befor thay cuud navigaet it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th juj he felt kiend of sor. He sed he rekond a body cuud

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER VI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, prity soon th oeld man was up and around agen, and then he went
      for Juj Thatcher in th corts to maek him giv up that muny, and he
      went for me, too, for not stoping scool. He catched me a cupl of
      tiems and thrasht me, but I went to scool just th saem, and dojd him
      or outrun him moest of th tiem. I didn’t wont to go to scool
      much befor, but I rekond I’d go now to spiet pap. That law
      trieal was a slo biznes—apeerd liek thay worn’t ever going
      to get started on it; so evry now and then I’d borro too or three
      dolars off of th juj for him, to keep frum geting a cowhiding. Evry
      tiem he got muny he got drunk; and evry tiem he got drunk he raezd Cain
      around toun; and evry tiem he raezd Cain he got jaeld. He was
      just sooted—this kiend of thing was riet in his lien.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got to hanging around th wido’s too much and so she toeld him at
      last that if he didn’t qit uezing around thair she wuud maek
      trubl for him. Wel, <i>wasn’t</i> he mad? He sed he wuud
      sho hoo was Huck Finn’s boss. So he wocht out for me wun
      day in th spring, and catched me, and tuuk me up th river about three
      miel in a skif, and crosst oever to th Illinois shor whair it was woody
      and thair worn’t no houses but an oeld log hut in a plaes whair th
      timber was so thik u couldn’t fiend it if u didn’t noe
      whair it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept me with him all th tiem, and I never got a chans to run off. We
      livd in that oeld cabin, and he allways lokt th dor and puut th kee
      under his hed niets. He had a gun which he had stoel, I rekon,
      and we fished and hunted, and that was whut we livd on. Evry
      litl whiel he lokt me in and went doun to th stor, three miels, to
      th ferry, and traeded fish and gaem for whisky, and fetched it hoem and
      got drunk and had a guud tiem, and likt me. Th wido she found
      out whair I was bi and bi, and she sent a man oever to tri to get hoeld of
      me; but pap droev him off with th gun, and it worn’t long after
      that til I was uezd to being whair I was, and liekt it—all but th
      cow-hied part.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was kiend of laezy and joly, laying off cumfortabl all day, smoeking and
      fishing, and no buuks nor study. Too munths or mor run along, and
      mi cloeths got to be all rags and dert, and I didn’t see how I’d
      ever got to liek it so wel at th wido’s, whair u had to wosh,
      and eet on a plaet, and coem up, and go to bed and get up reguelar, and be
      forever bothering oever a buuk, and hav oeld Mis Watson pecking at u all
      th tiem. I didn’t wont to go bak no mor. I had
      stopt cussing, becauz th wido didn’t liek it; but now I tuuk to
      it agen becauz pap hadn’t no objecshuns. It was prity guud
      tiems up in th wuuds thair, taek it all around.

      But bi and bi pap got too handy with his hik’ry, and I couldn’t
      stand it. I was all oever welts. He got to going away so much, too,
      and loking me in. Wuns he lokt me in and was gon three days.
      It was dredful loensum. I jujd he had got drownded, and I
      wasn’t ever going to get out eny mor. I was scaird. I
      maed up mi miend I wuud fix up sum way to leev thair. I had tried
      to get out of that cabin meny a tiem, but I couldn’t fiend no way.
      Thair worn’t a windo to it big enuf for a daug to get
      thru. I couldn’t get up th chimbly; it was too narro.
      Th dor was thik, solid oek slabs. Pap was prity cairful
      not to leev a nief or enything in th cabin when he was away; I rekon I
      had hunted th plaes oever as much as a hundred tiems; wel, I was moest all
      th tiem at it, becauz it was about th oenly way to puut in th tiem.
      But this tiem I found sumthing at last; I found an oeld rusty
      wuud-saw without eny handl; it was laed in between a rafter and th
      clapboards of th roof. I greest it up and went to werk. Thair was
      an oeld hors-blanket naeld agenst th logs at th far end of th cabin
      behiend th taebl, to keep th wiend frum bloeing thru th chinks and
      puuting th candl out. I got under th taebl and raezd th
      blanket, and went to werk to saw a secshun of th big botom log out—big
      enuf to let me thru. Wel, it was a guud long job, but I was
      geting tords th end of it when I herd pap’s gun in th wuuds.
      I got rid of th siens of mi werk, and dropt th blanket and hid
      mi saw, and prity soon pap cum in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pap worn’t in a guud huemor—so he was his nacheral self. He
      sed he was doun toun, and evrything was going rong. His lawyer
      sed he rekond he wuud win his lawsoot and get th muny if thay ever
      got started on th trieal; but then thair was ways to puut it off a long
      tiem, and Juj Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he sed peepl alowd
      thair’d be anuther trieal to get me away frum him and giv me to th
      wido for mi gardian, and thay gest it wuud win this tiem. This
      shuuk me up considerabl, becauz I didn’t wont to go bak to th
      wido’s eny mor and be so cramped up and sivilized, as thay calld
      it. Then th oeld man got to cussing, and cussed evrything and
      evrybody he cuud think of, and then cussed them all oever agen to maek
      shur he hadn’t skipt eny, and after that he polisht off with a
      kiend of a jeneral cuss all round, inclooding a considerabl parsel of
      peepl which he didn’t noe th naems of, and so calld them whut’s-his-naem
      when he got to them, and went riet along with his cussing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sed he wuud liek to see th wido get me. He sed he wuud
      woch out, and if thay tried to cum eny such gaem on him he knowed of a
      plaes six or seven miel off to stow me in, whair thay miet hunt til thay
      dropt and thay couldn’t fiend me. That maed me prity uneezy
      agen, but oenly for a minit; I rekond I wouldn’t stay on hand
      til he got that chans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th oeld man maed me go to th skif and fech th things he had got. Thair
      was a fifty-pound sak of corn meel, and a sied of baecon, amuenishun, and
      a foer-galon jug of whisky, and an oeld buuk and too nuespaepers for
      woding, besieds sum toe. I toeted up a loed, and went bak and set
      doun on th bo of th skif to rest. I thaut it all oever, and I
      rekond I wuud wauk off with th gun and sum liens, and taek to th
      wuuds when I run away. I gest I wouldn’t stay in wun plaes,
      but just tramp riet across th cuntry, moestly niet tiems, and hunt and
      fish to keep aliev, and so get so far away that th oeld man nor th wido
      couldn’t ever fiend me eny mor. I jujd I wuud saw out and
      leev that niet if pap got drunk enuf, and I rekond he wuud. I
      got so fuul of it I didn’t noetis how long I was staying til th
      oeld man holerd and askt me whether I was asleep or drownded.

      I got th things all up to th cabin, and then it was about dark. Whiel
      I was cuuking super th oeld man tuuk a swig or too and got sort of wormd
      up, and went to riping agen. He had bin drunk oever in toun, and
      laed in th guter all niet, and he was a siet to luuk at. A body
      wuud a thaut he was Adam—he was just all mud. Whenever his
      likor begun to werk he moest allways went for th govment, this tiem he
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Call this a govment! whi, just luuk at it and see whut it’s
      liek. Heer’s th law a-standing redy to taek a man’s sun away
      frum him—a man’s oen sun, which he has had all th trubl and
      all th angzieity and all th expens of raezing. Yes, just as that
      man has got that sun raezd at last, and redy to go to werk and begin to
      do suthin’ for <i>him</i> and giv him a rest, th law up and goes
      for him. And thay call <i>that</i> govment! That ain’t
      all, nuther. Th law baks that oeld Juj Thatcher up and helps him
      to keep me out o’ mi property. Heer’s whut th law duz:
      Th law taeks a man werth six thouzand dolars and up’ards,
      and jams him into an oeld trap of a cabin liek this, and lets him go round
      in cloeths that ain’t fitten for a hog. Thay call that govment!
      A man can’t get his riets in a govment liek this. Sumtiems I’ve
      a miety noeshun to just leev th cuntry for guud and all. Yes, and I <i>toeld</i>
      ’em so; I toeld oeld Thatcher so to his faes. Lots of ’em
      herd me, and can tel whut I sed. Sez I, for too sents I’d
      leev th blaemd cuntry and never cum a-neer it agin. Them’s
      th verry werds. I sez luuk at mi hat—if u call it a hat—but
      th lid raezes up and th rest of it goes doun til it’s belo mi
      chin, and then it ain’t rietly a hat at all, but mor liek mi hed
      was shuvd up thru a jint o’ stoev-piep. Luuk at it, sez I—such
      a hat for me to wair—wun of th welthyest men in this toun if I
      cuud git mi riets.
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, yes, this is a wunderful govment, wunderful. Whi, luuky
      heer. Thair was a free nigger thair frum Ohio—a mulatter, moest as
      whiet as a whiet man. He had th whitest shert on u ever see, too,
      and th shiniest hat; and thair ain’t a man in that toun that’s
      got as fien cloeths as whut he had; and he had a goeld woch and chaen, and
      a silver-heded caen—th awfulest oeld gray-heded naebob in th
      Staet. And whut do u think? Thay sed he was a p’fessor
      in a colej, and cuud tauk all kiends of langgwejes, and knowed
      evrything. And that ain’t th wust. Thay sed he cuud <i>voet</i>
      when he was at hoem. Wel, that let me out. Thinks I, whut is th
      cuntry a-cuming to? It was ’lection day, and I was just about
      to go and voet mieself if I worn’t too drunk to get thair; but when
      thay toeld me thair was a Staet in this cuntry whair thay’d let that
      nigger voet, I drawed out. I sez I’ll never voet agin. Them’s
      th verry werds I sed; thay all herd me; and th cuntry may rot for all
      me—I’ll never voet agin as long as I liv. And to see
      th cool way of that nigger—whi, he wouldn’t a giv me th
      roed if I hadn’t shuvd him out o’ th way. I sez to
      th peepl, whi ain’t this nigger puut up at aucshun and soeld?—that’s
      whut I wont to noe. And whut do u rekon thay sed? Whi, thay
      sed he couldn’t be soeld til he’d bin in th Staet six
      munths, and he hadn’t bin thair that long yet. Thair, now—that’s
      a spesimen. Thay call that a govment that can’t sel a free
      nigger til he’s bin in th Staet six munths. Heer’s a
      govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and
      thinks it is a govment, and yet’s got to set stok-stil for six
      hoel munths befor it can taek a hoeld of a prouling, theeving, infernal,
      whiet-shirted free nigger, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pap was agoing on so he never noetist whair his oeld limber legs was taeking
      him to, so he went hed oever heels oever th tub of sallt pork and barked
      boeth shins, and th rest of his speech was all th hotest kiend of
      langgwej—moestly hoev at th nigger and th govment, tho he giv
      th tub sum, too, all along, heer and thair. He hopt around th
      cabin considerabl, ferst on wun leg and then on th uther, hoelding ferst
      wun shin and then th uther wun, and at last he let out with his left fuut
      all of a suden and fetched th tub a ratling kik. But it worn’t
      guud jujment, becauz that was th boot that had a cupl of his toes
      leaking out of th frunt end of it; so now he raezd a houl that fairly
      maed a body’s hair raez, and doun he went in th dert, and roeld
      thair, and held his toes; and th cussing he dun then laed oever enything
      he had ever dun preevius. He sed so his oen self afterwards.
      He had herd oeld Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he sed it
      laed oever him, too; but I rekon that was sort of pieling it on, maybe.
    </p>
    <p>
      After super pap tuuk th jug, and sed he had enuf whisky thair for too
      drunks and wun deleerium tremens. That was allways his werd. I
      jujd he wuud be bliend drunk in about an our, and then I wuud steel
      th kee, or saw mieself out, wun or t’uther. He drank and
      drank, and tumbld doun on his blankets bi and bi; but luk didn’t
      run mi way. He didn’t go sound asleep, but was uneezy. He
      groend and moend and thrasht around this way and that for a long tiem.
      At last I got so sleepy I couldn’t keep mi ies oepen all I
      cuud do, and so befor I knowed whut I was about I was sound asleep, and
      th candl berning.

      I don’t noe how long I was asleep, but all of a suden thair was an
      awful screem and I was up. Thair was pap luuking wield, and skiping
      around evry which way and yeling about snaeks. He sed thay was
      cralling up his legs; and then he wuud giv a jump and screem, and say
      wun had bit him on th cheek—but I couldn’t see no snaeks.
      He started and run round and round th cabin, holering “Taek
      him off! taek him off! he’s bieting me on th nek!” I
      never see a man luuk so wield in th ies. Prity soon he was all fagd
      out, and fel doun panting; then he roeld oever and oever wunderful fast,
      kiking things evry which way, and strieking and grabing at th air with
      his hands, and screeming and saying thair was devils a-hoeld of him. He
      wor out bi and bi, and laed stil a whiel, moaning. Then he laed
      stiller, and didn’t maek a sound. I cuud heer th ouls and
      th wuulvs away off in th wuuds, and it seemd terribl stil. He
      was laying oever bi th corner. Bi and bi he raezd up part way and
      lisend, with his hed to wun sied. He sez, verry lo:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tramp—tramp—tramp; that’s th ded; tramp—tramp—tramp;
      thay’re cuming after me; but I wun’t go. O, thay’re
      heer! don’t tuch me—don’t! hands off—thay’re
      coeld; let go. O, let a pur devil aloen!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went doun on all foers and cralld off, beging them to let him
      aloen, and he roeld himself up in his blanket and woloed in under th
      oeld pien taebl, stil a-beging; and then he went to crieing. I cuud
      heer him thru th blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bi and bi he roeld out and jumpt up on his feet luuking wield, and he see
      me and went for me. He chaest me round and round th plaes with a
      clasp-nief, calling me th Aenjel of Deth, and saying he wuud kil me,
      and then I couldn’t cum for him no mor. I begd, and toeld
      him I was oenly Huck; but he laft <i>such</i> a screechy laf, and
      rord and cussed, and kept on chaesing me up. Wuns when I ternd
      short and dojd under his arm he maed a grab and got me bi th jaket
      between mi shoelders, and I thaut I was gon; but I slid out of th
      jaket qik as lietning, and saevd mieself. Prity soon he was all tierd
      out, and dropt doun with his bak agenst th dor, and sed he wuud
      rest a minit and then kil me. He puut his nief under him, and sed he
      wuud sleep and get strong, and then he wuud see hoo was hoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he doezd off prity soon. Bi and bi I got th oeld split-botom
      chair and clumb up as eezy as I cuud, not to maek eny noiz, and got doun
      th gun. I slipt th ramrod doun it to maek shur it was loeded,
      then I laed it across th ternip barrel, pointing tords pap, and set
      doun behiend it to waet for him to ster. And how slo and stil th
      tiem did drag along.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER VII.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Git up! Whut u ’bout?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I oepend mi ies and luukt around, trieing to maek out whair I was. It
      was after sun-up, and I had bin sound asleep. Pap was standing oever
      me luuking sour and sik, too. He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut u doin’ with this gun?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I jujd he didn’t noe nuthing about whut he had bin doing, so I
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sumbody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi didn’t u roust me out?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I tried to, but I couldn’t; I couldn’t buj u.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, all riet. Don’t stand thair palavering all day,
      but out with u and see if thair’s a fish on th liens for
      brekfast. I’ll be along in a minit.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He unlokt th dor, and I cleerd out up th river-bank. I noetist
      sum peeses of lims and such things floeting doun, and a sprinkling of
      bark; so I knowed th river had begun to riez. I rekond I wuud
      hav graet tiems now if I was oever at th toun. Th June riez uezd
      to be allways luk for me; becauz as soon as that riez begins heer cums
      cordwood floeting doun, and peeses of log rafts—sumtiems a duzen
      logs together; so all u hav to do is to cach them and sel them to th
      wuud-yards and th sawmil.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went along up th bank with wun ie out for pap and t’uther wun
      out for whut th riez miet fech along. Wel, all at wuns heer
      cums a canoo; just a buety, too, about therteen or forteen fuut long,
      rieding hi liek a duk. I shot hed-ferst off of th bank liek a
      frog, cloeths and all on, and struk out for th canoo. I just
      expected thair’d be sumbody laying doun in it, becauz peepl offen
      dun that to fool foeks, and when a chap had puuld a skif out moest to it
      thay’d raez up and laf at him. But it worn’t so this
      tiem. It was a drift-canoo shur enuf, and I clumb in and paddled
      her ashor. Thinks I, th oeld man wil be glad when he sees this—she’s
      werth ten dolars. But when I got to shor pap wasn’t in siet
      yet, and as I was runing her into a litl creek liek a guly, all hung
      oever with viens and wiloes, I struk anuther iedeea: I jujd I’d
      hied her guud, and then, ’sted of taeking to th wuuds when I run
      off, I’d go doun th river about fifty miel and camp in wun plaes
      for guud, and not hav such a ruf tiem tramping on fuut.

      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was prity cloez to th shanty, and I thaut I herd th oeld man
      cuming all th tiem; but I got her hid; and then I out and luukt around a
      bunch of wiloes, and thair was th oeld man doun th path a pees just
      drawing a beed on a berd with his gun. So he hadn’t seen
      enything.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got along I was hard at it taeking up a “trot” lien.
      He abuezd me a litl for being so slo; but I toeld him I fel in
      th river, and that was whut maed me so long. I knowed he wuud see
      I was wet, and then he wuud be asking qeschuns. We got fiev
      catfish off th liens and went hoem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whiel we laed off after brekfast to sleep up, boeth of us being about wor
      out, I got to thinking that if I cuud fix up sum way to keep pap and th
      wido frum trieing to folo me, it wuud be a certainer thing than
      trusting to luk to get far enuf off befor thay mist me; u see, all
      kiends of things miet hapen. Wel, I didn’t see no way for a
      whiel, but bi and bi pap raezd up a minit to drink anuther barrel of
      wauter, and he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Anuther tiem a man cums a-prouling round heer u roust me out,
      u heer? That man worn’t heer for no guud. I’d a shot
      him. Next tiem u roust me out, u heer?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he dropt doun and went to sleep agen; but whut he had bin saying
      giv me th verry iedeea I wonted. I sez to mieself, I can fix it now
      so noebody wun’t think of foloeing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      About twelv o’clok we ternd out and went along up th bank.
      Th river was cuming up prity fast, and lots of driftwuud going bi
      on th riez. Bi and bi along cums part of a log raft—nien logs fast
      together. We went out with th skif and toed it ashor. Then
      we had diner. Enybody but pap wuud a waeted and seen th day thru, so
      as to cach mor stuf; but that worn’t pap’s stiel. Nien
      logs was enuf for wun tiem; he must shuv riet oever to toun and sel.
      So he lokt me in and tuuk th skif, and started off towing th
      raft about haf-past three. I jujd he wouldn’t cum bak
      that niet. I waeted til I rekond he had got a guud start; then I
      out with mi saw, and went to werk on that log agen. Befor he was t’uther
      sied of th river I was out of th hoel; him and his raft was just a spek
      on th wauter away off yonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tuuk th sak of corn meel and tuuk it to whair th canoo was hid, and
      shuvd th viens and branches apart and puut it in; then I dun th saem
      with th sied of baecon; then th whisky-jug. I tuuk all th coffy
      and shuugar thair was, and all th amuenishun; I tuuk th woding; I tuuk
      th buket and gord; I tuuk a diper and a tin cup, and mi oeld saw and
      too blankets, and th skilet and th coffy-pot. I tuuk fish-liens
      and maches and uther things—evrything that was werth a sent.
      I cleend out th plaes. I wonted an ax, but thair wasn’t
      eny, oenly th wun out at th wuudpiel, and I knowed whi I was going to
      leev that. I fetched out th gun, and now I was dun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had wor th ground a guud deel cralling out of th hoel and draging
      out so meny things. So I fixt that as guud as I cuud frum th
      outsied bi scatering dust on th plaes, which cuverd up th smoothnes
      and th sawdust. Then I fixt th pees of log bak into its plaes,
      and puut too roks under it and wun agenst it to hoeld it thair, for it was
      bent up at that plaes and didn’t qiet tuch ground. If u
      stuud foer or fiev fuut away and didn’t noe it was sawd, u
      wouldn’t never noetis it; and besieds, this was th bak of th
      cabin, and it worn’t liekly enybody wuud go fooling around thair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all gras cleer to th canoo, so I hadn’t left a trak.
      I foloed around to see. I stuud on th bank and luukt out
      oever th river. All saef. So I tuuk th gun and went up a
      pees into th wuuds, and was hunting around for sum berds when I see a
      wield pig; hogs soon went wield in them botoms after thay had got away frum
      th prairy farms. I shot this felo and tuuk him into camp.

      I tuuk th ax and smasht in th dor. I beet it and hakt it
      considerabl a-doing it. I fetched th pig in, and tuuk him bak
      neerly to th taebl and hakt into his throet with th ax, and laed him
      doun on th ground to bleed; I say ground becauz it was ground—hard
      pakt, and no bords. Wel, next I tuuk an oeld sak and puut a lot
      of big roks in it—all I cuud drag—and I started it frum th
      pig, and dragd it to th dor and thru th wuuds doun to th river
      and dumpt it in, and doun it sunk, out of siet. U cuud eezy see
      that sumthing had bin dragd oever th ground. I did wish Tom
      Sawyer was thair; I knowed he wuud taek an interest in this kiend of
      biznes, and thro in th fansy tuches. Noebody cuud spred
      himself liek Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, last I puuld out sum of mi hair, and bluded th ax guud, and
      stuk it on th bak sied, and slung th ax in th corner. Then I
      tuuk up th pig and held him to mi brest with mi jaket (so he couldn’t
      drip) til I got a guud pees belo th hous and then dumpt him into th
      river. Now I thaut of sumthing els. So I went and got th
      bag of meel and mi oeld saw out of th canoo, and fetched them to th
      hous. I tuuk th bag to whair it uezd to stand, and ript a hoel
      in th botom of it with th saw, for thair worn’t no nievs and
      forks on th plaes—pap dun evrything with his clasp-nief about
      th cuuking. Then I carryd th sak about a hundred yards across
      th gras and thru th wiloes eest of th hous, to a shalo laek
      that was fiev miel wied and fuul of rushes—and duks too, u miet
      say, in th seezon. Thair was a sluf or a creek leding out of it
      on th uther sied that went miels away, I don’t noe whair, but it
      didn’t go to th river. Th meel sifted out and maed a litl
      trak all th way to th laek. I dropt pap’s whetstoen thair
      too, so as to luuk liek it had bin dun bi acsident. Then I tied up th
      rip in th meel sak with a string, so it wouldn’t leek no mor, and
      tuuk it and mi saw to th canoo agen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about dark now; so I dropt th canoo doun th river under sum
      wiloes that hung oever th bank, and waeted for th moon to riez. I
      maed fast to a wilo; then I tuuk a biet to eet, and bi and bi laed doun
      in th canoo to smoek a piep and lay out a plan. I sez to mieself,
      thay’ll folo th trak of that sakful of roks to th shor and
      then drag th river for me. And thay’ll folo that meel trak
      to th laek and go brouzing doun th creek that leeds out of it to fiend
      th robers that kild me and tuuk th things. Thay wun’t
      ever hunt th river for enything but mi ded carcas. Thay’ll soon
      get tierd of that, and wun’t bother no mor about me. All
      riet; I can stop enywhair I wont to. Jackson’s Ieland is guud
      enuf for me; I noe that ieland prity wel, and noebody ever cums
      thair. And then I can padl oever to toun niets, and slink around
      and pik up things I wont. Jackson’s Ieland’s th plaes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was prity tierd, and th ferst thing I knowed I was asleep. When
      I woek up I didn’t noe whair I was for a minit. I set up and
      luukt around, a litl scaird. Then I rememberd. Th river
      luukt miels and miels across. Th moon was so briet I cuud a
      counted th drift logs that went a-sliping along, blak and stil,
      hundreds of yards out frum shor. Evrything was ded qieet, and it luukt
      laet, and <i>smelt</i> laet. U noe whut I meen—I don’t noe
      th werds to puut it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tuuk a guud gap and a strech, and was just going to unhitch and start
      when I herd a sound away oever th wauter. I lisend. Prity
      soon I maed it out. It was that dul kiend of a reguelar sound that
      cums frum ors werking in rowlocks when it’s a stil niet. I
      peeped out thru th wilo branches, and thair it was—a skif,
      away across th wauter. I couldn’t tel how meny was in it.
      It kept a-cuming, and when it was abrest of me I see thair worn’t
      but wun man in it. Think’s I, maybe it’s pap, tho I
      worn’t expecting him. He dropt belo me with th curent,
      and bi and bi he caem a-swinging up shor in th eezy wauter, and he went
      bi so cloez I cuud a reecht out th gun and tucht him. Wel, it
      <i>was</i> pap, shur enuf—and soeber, too, bi th way he laed his
      ors.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t looz no tiem. Th next minit I was a-spining doun
      streem sofft but qik in th shaed of th bank. I maed too miel and
      a haf, and then struk out a qorter of a miel or mor tords th midl
      of th river, becauz prity soon I wuud be pasing th ferry landing,
      and peepl miet see me and hael me. I got out amungst th
      driftwuud, and then laed doun in th botom of th canoo and let her
      floet.

    <p>
      I laed thair, and had a guud rest and a smoek out of mi piep,
      luuking away into th skie; not a cloud in it. Th skie luuks ever so
      deep when u lay doun on yur bak in th moonshien; I never knowed it
      befor. And how far a body can heer on th wauter such niets! I
      herd peepl tauking at th ferry landing. I herd whut thay sed, too—evry
      werd of it. Wun man sed it was geting tords th long days and
      th short niets now. T’uther wun sed <i>this</i> worn’t
      wun of th short wuns, he rekond—and then thay laft, and he
      sed it oever agen, and thay laft agen; then thay waekt up anuther
      felo and toeld him, and laft, but he didn’t laf; he ript out
      sumthing brisk, and sed let him aloen. Th ferst felo sed he
      ’lowed to tel it to his oeld wuuman—she wuud think it was
      prity guud; but he sed that worn’t nuthing to sum things he had
      sed in his tiem. I herd wun man say it was neerly three o’clok,
      and he hoept dayliet wouldn’t waet mor than about a week longger.
      After that th tauk got ferther and ferther away, and I couldn’t
      maek out th werds eny mor; but I cuud heer th mumbl, and now and then
      a laf, too, but it seemd a long ways off.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was away belo th ferry now. I roez up, and thair was Jackson’s
      Ieland, about too miel and a haf doun streem, hevy timberd and standing
      up out of th midl of th river, big and dark and solid, liek a
      steemboet without eny liets. Thair worn’t eny siens of th
      bar at th hed—it was all under wauter now.
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn’t taek me long to get thair. I shot past th hed at a
      riping raet, th curent was so swift, and then I got into th ded wauter
      and landed on th sied tords th Illinois shor. I run th canoo
      into a deep dent in th bank that I knowed about; I had to part th wilo
      branches to get in; and when I maed fast noebody cuud a seen th canoo
      frum th outsied.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up and set doun on a log at th hed of th ieland, and luukt out
      on th big river and th blak driftwuud and away oever to th toun, three
      miel away, whair thair was three or foer liets twinkling. A
      monstrus big lumber-raft was about a miel up streem, cuming along doun,
      with a lantern in th midl of it. I wocht it cum creeping doun,
      and when it was moest abrest of whair I stuud I herd a man say, “Stern
      ors, thair! heev her hed to stabboard!” I herd that just
      as plaen as if th man was bi mi sied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thair was a litl gray in th skie now; so I stept into th wuuds, and
      laed doun for a nap befor brekfast.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER VIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th sun was up so hi when I waekt that I jujd it was after aet o’clok.
      I laed thair in th gras and th cool shaed thinking about things,
      and feeling rested and ruther cumfortabl and satisfied. I cuud see
      th sun out at wun or too hoels, but moestly it was big trees all about,
      and gloomy in thair amungst them. Thair was frekld plaeses on th
      ground whair th liet sifted doun thru th leevs, and th frekld
      plaeses swapped about a litl, shoeing thair was a litl breez up thair.
      A cupl of sqerels set on a lim and jabbered at me verry
      frendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was powerful laezy and cumfortabl—didn’t wont to get up and
      cuuk brekfast. Wel, I was doezing off agen when I thinks I heers a
      deep sound of “boom!” away up th river. I rouses up,
      and rests on mi elbo and lisens; prity soon I heers it agen. I
      hopt up, and went and luukt out at a hoel in th leevs, and I see a
      bunch of smoek laying on th wauter a long ways up—about abrest th
      ferry. And thair was th ferryboet fuul of peepl floeting along
      doun. I knowed whut was th mater now. “Boom!” I see
      th whiet smoek sqert out of th ferryboet’s sied. U see,
      thay was fiering canon oever th wauter, trieing to maek mi carcas cum to
      th top.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was prity hunggry, but it worn’t going to do for me to start a
      fier, becauz thay miet see th smoek. So I set thair and wocht
      th canon-smoek and lisend to th boom. Th river was a miel wied
      thair, and it allways luuks prity on a sumer morning—so I was
      having a guud enuf tiem seeing them hunt for mi remainders if I oenly had
      a biet to eet. Wel, then I hapend to think how thay allways puut
      qiksilver in loevs of bred and floet them off, becauz thay allways go
      riet to th drownded carcas and stop thair. So, sez I, I’ll
      keep a luukout, and if eny of them’s floeting around after me I’ll
      giv them a sho. I chaenjd to th Illinois ej of th ieland to
      see whut luk I cuud hav, and I worn’t disapointed. A big
      dubl loef cum along, and I moest got it with a long stik, but mi fuut
      slipt and she floeted out ferther. Of cors I was whair th
      curent set in th cloesest to th shor—I knowed enuf for that.
      But bi and bi along cums anuther wun, and this tiem I wun. I
      tuuk out th plug and shuuk out th litl dab of qiksilver, and set mi
      teeth in. It was “baeker’s bred”—whut th
      qolity eet; nun of yur lo-doun corn-pone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got a guud plaes amungst th leevs, and set thair on a log, munching
      th bred and woching th ferry-boet, and verry wel satisfied. And
      then sumthing struk me. I sez, now I rekon th wido or th
      parson or sumbody prayd that this bred wuud fiend me, and heer it has
      gon and dun it. So thair ain’t no dout but thair is
      sumthing in that thing—that is, thair’s sumthing in it when
      a body liek th wido or th parson prays, but it don’t werk for me,
      and I rekon it don’t werk for oenly just th riet kiend.
    </p>

      <br> <br> <a name="c08-63" id="c08-63"></a><br> <br>

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I lit a piep and had a guud long smoek, and went on woching. Th
      ferryboet was floeting with th curent, and I alowd I’d hav a
      chans to see hoo was abord when she cum along, becauz she wuud cum
      in cloez, whair th bred did. When she’d got prity wel
      along doun tords me, I puut out mi piep and went to whair I fished out
      th bred, and laed doun behiend a log on th bank in a litl oepen plaes.
      Whair th log forkt I cuud peep thru.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bi and bi she cum along, and she drifted in so cloez that thay cuud a
      run out a plank and waukt ashor. Moest evrybody was on th boet.
      Pap, and Juj Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom
      Sawyer, and his oeld Ant Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty mor. Evrybody
      was tauking about th merder, but th capten broek in and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Luuk sharp, now; th curent sets in th cloesest heer, and maybe he’s
      wosht ashor and got tanggld amungst th brush at th wauter’s ej.
      I hoep so, enyway.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t hoep so. Thay all crouded up and leend oever th
      raels, neerly in mi faes, and kept stil, woching with all thair miet.
      I cuud see them ferst-raet, but thay couldn’t see me. Then
      th capten sung out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stand away!” and th canon let off such a blast riet befor
      me that it maed me deef with th noiz and prity neer bliend with th
      smoek, and I jujd I was gon. If thay’d a had sum buulets
      in, I rekon thay’d a got th corps thay was after. Wel, I
      see I worn’t hert, thanks to guudnes. Th boet floeted on and went
      out of siet around th shoelder of th ieland. I cuud heer th
      booming now and then, ferther and ferther off, and bi and bi, after an
      our, I didn’t heer it no mor. Th ieland was three miel
      long. I jujd thay had got to th fuut, and was giving it up.
      But thay didn’t yet a whiel. Thay ternd around th fuut
      of th ieland and started up th chanel on th Missouri sied, under
      steem, and booming wuns in a whiel as thay went. I crosst oever to
      that sied and wocht them. When thay got abrest th hed of th ieland
      thay qit shooting and dropt oever to th Missouri shor and went hoem to
      th toun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knowed I was all riet now. Noebody els wuud cum a-hunting after
      me. I got mi traps out of th canoo and maed me a nies camp in th thik
      wuuds. I maed a kiend of a tent out of mi blankets to puut mi things
      under so th raen couldn’t get at them. I catched a catfish
      and haggled him oepen with mi saw, and tords sundoun I started mi camp
      fier and had super. Then I set out a lien to cach sum fish for
      brekfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was dark I set bi mi camp fier smoeking, and feeling prity wel
      satisfied; but bi and bi it got sort of loensum, and so I went and set on
      th bank and lisend to th curent swashing along, and counted th stars
      and drift logs and rafts that cum doun, and then went to bed; thair ain’t
      no beter way to puut in tiem when u ar loensum; u can’t stay
      so, u soon get oever it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so for three days and niets. No diferens—just th saem
      thing. But th next day I went exploring around doun thru th ieland.
      I was boss of it; it all belongd to me, so to say, and I wonted to
      noe all about it; but maenly I wonted to puut in th tiem. I found
      plenty strawberrys, riep and priem; and green sumer graeps, and green
      razberries; and th green blackberries was just begining to sho. Thay
      wuud all cum handy bi and bi, I jujd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, I went fooling along in th deep wuuds til I jujd I worn’t
      far frum th fuut of th ieland. I had mi gun along, but I hadn’t
      shot nuthing; it was for protecshun; thaut I wuud kil sum gaem ni
      hoem. About this tiem I miety neer stept on a guud-siezd snaek, and it
      went slieding off thru th gras and flowers, and I after it, trieing to
      get a shot at it. I clipt along, and all of a suden I bounded riet on
      to th ashes of a camp fier that was stil smoeking.

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mi hart jumpt up amungst mi lungs. I never waeted for to luuk
      ferther, but uncocked mi gun and went sneeking bak on mi tiptoes as fast
      as ever I cuud. Evry now and then I stopt a second amungst th
      thik leevs and lisend, but mi breth cum so hard I couldn’t
      heer nuthing els. I slunk along anuther pees ferther, then
      lisend agen; and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I tuuk it
      for a man; if I trod on a stik and broek it, it maed me feel liek a
      person had cut wun of mi breths in too and I oenly got haf, and th short
      haf, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got to camp I worn’t feeling verry brash, thair worn’t
      much sand in mi craw; but I sez, this ain’t no tiem to be fooling
      around. So I got all mi traps into mi canoo agen so as to hav them
      out of siet, and I puut out th fier and scaterd th ashes around to
      luuk liek an oeld last yeer’s camp, and then clumb a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rekon I was up in th tree too ours; but I didn’t see nuthing, I
      didn’t heer nuthing—I oenly <i>thaut</i> I herd and seen as
      much as a thouzand things. Wel, I couldn’t stay up thair
      forever; so at last I got doun, but I kept in th thik wuuds and on th
      luukout all th tiem. All I cuud get to eet was berrys and whut was left
      oever frum brekfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bi th tiem it was niet I was prity hunggry. So when it was guud
      and dark I slid out frum shor befor moonrise and paddled oever to th
      Illinois bank—about a qorter of a miel. I went out in th
      wuuds and cuukt a super, and I had about maed up mi miend I wuud stay
      thair all niet when I heer a <i>plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk</i>, and
      sez to mieself, horses cuming; and next I heer peepl’s voises.
      I got evrything into th canoo as qik as I cuud, and then went
      creeping thru th wuuds to see whut I cuud fiend out. I hadn’t
      got far when I heer a man say:
    </p>
    <p>
      “We beter camp heer if we can fiend a guud plaes; th horses is
      about beet out. Let’s luuk around.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t waet, but shuvd out and paddled away eezy. I tied up
      in th oeld plaes, and rekond I wuud sleep in th canoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t sleep much. I couldn’t, sumhow, for thinking.
      And evry tiem I waekt up I thaut sumbody had me bi th nek.
      So th sleep didn’t do me no guud. Bi and bi I sez to
      mieself, I can’t liv this way; I’m a-going to fiend out hoo it
      is that’s heer on th ieland with me; I’ll fiend it out or
      bust. Wel, I felt beter riet off.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I tuuk mi padl and slid out frum shor just a step or too, and then
      let th canoo drop along doun amungst th shadoes. Th moon was
      shiening, and outsied of th shadoes it maed it moest as liet as day.
      I poekt along wel on to an our, evrything stil as roks and
      sound asleep. Wel, bi this tiem I was moest doun to th fuut of th
      ieland. A litl ripply, cool breez begun to blo, and that was as
      guud as saying th niet was about dun. I giv her a tern with th
      padl and brung her noez to shor; then I got mi gun and slipt out and
      into th ej of th wuuds. I sat doun thair on a log, and luukt
      out thru th leevs. I see th moon go off woch, and th
      darknes begin to blanket th river. But in a litl whiel I see a pael
      streek oever th treetops, and knowed th day was cuming. So I tuuk
      mi gun and slipt off tords whair I had run across that camp fier,
      stoping evry minit or too to lisen. But I hadn’t no luk
      sumhow; I couldn’t seem to fiend th plaes. But bi and bi,
      shur enuf, I catched a glimps of fier away thru th trees. I
      went for it, caushus and slo. Bi and bi I was cloez enuf to hav
      a luuk, and thair laed a man on th ground. It moest giv me th
      fan-tods. He had a blanket around his hed, and his hed was neerly in th
      fier. I set thair behiend a clump of buushes, in about six fuut of
      him, and kept mi ies on him stedy. It was geting gray dayliet
      now. Prity soon he gapped and strecht himself and hoev off th
      blanket, and it was Mis Watson’s Jim! I bet I was glad to see
      him. I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Helo, Jim!” and skipt out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bounst up and staird at me wield. Then he drops doun on his
      nees, and puuts his hands together and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doan’ hert me—don’t! I hain’t ever
      dun no harm to a ghos’. I alwuz liekt ded peepl, en dun
      all I cuud for ’em. U go en git in de river agin, whah u
      b’longs, en doan’ do nuffn to Oelay Jim, ’at ’uz
      awluz yo’ fren’.”

    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, I worn’t long maeking him understand I worn’t ded.
      I was ever so glad to see Jim. I worn’t loensum now.
      I toeld him I worn’t afraed of <i>him</i> teling th peepl
      whair I was. I taukt along, but he oenly set thair and luukt at me;
      never sed nuthing. Then I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s guud dayliet. Le’s get brekfast. Maek
      up yur camp fier guud.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut’s de ues er makin’ up de camp fier to cuuk
      strawbries en sich truk? But u got a gun, hain’t u? Den
      we kin git sumfn beter den strawbries.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Strawberrys and such truk,” I sez. “Is that whut u
      liv on?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I couldn’ git nuffn els,” he sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, how long u bin on th ieland, Jim?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I cum heah de niet arter u’s kild.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut, all that tiem?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes—indeedy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And ain’t u had nuthing but that kiend of rubbage to eet?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sah—nuffn els.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, u must be moest starvd, ain’t u?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I reck’n I cuud eet a hoss. I think I cuud. How long
      u ben on de islan’?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sinss th niet I got kild.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No! W’y, whut has u livd on? But u got a
      gun. O, yes, u got a gun. Dat’s guud. Now u
      kil sumfn en I’ll maek up de fier.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So we went oever to whair th canoo was, and whiel he bilt a fier in a
      grasy oepen plaes amungst th trees, I fetched meel and baecon and coffy,
      and coffy-pot and frieing-pan, and shuugar and tin cups, and th nigger was
      set bak considerabl, becauz he rekond it was all dun with
      wichcraft. I catched a guud big catfish, too, and Jim cleend him with
      his nief, and fried him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When brekfast was redy we lolled on th gras and eet it smoeking hot.
      Jim laed it in with all his miet, for he was moest about starvd. Then
      when we had got prity wel stuft, we laed off and lazied. Bi and
      bi Jim sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But luuky heer, Huck, hoo wuz it dat ’uz kild in dat shanty
      ef it worn’t u?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I toeld him th hoel thing, and he sed it was smart. He sed
      Tom Sawyer couldn’t get up no beter plan than whut I had. Then
      I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “How do u cum to be heer, Jim, and how’d u get heer?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He luukt prity uneezy, and didn’t say nuthing for a minit. Then
      he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe I beter not tel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Jim?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, day’s reezons. But u wouldn’ tel on me
      ef I uz to tel u, wuud u, Huck?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Blaemd if I wuud, Jim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I b’lieve u, Huck. I—<i>I run off</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Jim!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But miend, u sed u wouldn’ tel—u noe u sed

    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I did. I sed I wouldn’t, and I’ll stik to

    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, u see, it ’uz dis way. Oelay missus—dat’s
      Mis Watson—she peks on me all de tiem, en treets me pooty ruf,

    <p>
      “I tuk out en shin doun de hil, en ’spec to steel a skift

      Day wuz sumbody roun’ all de tiem. ’Long ’bout

    </p>
    <p>
      “I laed dah under de shavin’s all day. I ’uz

      De yuther servants wouldn’ mis me, kase day’d shin out en

    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, when it cum dark I tuk out up de river roed, en went
      ’bout too miel er mor to whah day worn’t no houses. I’d

    </p>
    <p>
      “I see a liet a-comin’ roun’ de p’int bymeby, so

      Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuk a-holt. It clouded up en

      “But I didn’ hav no luk. When we ’uz mos’

      Whi didn’t u get mud-turkles?”

    <p>
      “How u gwyne to git ’m? U can’t slip up on um
      en grab um; en how’s a body gwyne to hit um wid a rok? How
      cuud a body do it in de niet? En I worn’t gwyne to sho

    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, that’s so. U’ve had to keep in th wuuds
      all th tiem, of cors. Did u heer ’em shooting th canon?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, yes. I knowed day was arter u. I see um go bi

    </p>
    <p>
      Sum yung berds cum along, flieing a yard or too at a tiem and lieting.
      Jim sed it was a sien it was going to raen. He sed it was a sien
      when yung chikens floo that way, and so he rekond it was th saem way
      when yung berds dun it. I was going to cach sum of them, but Jim
      wouldn’t let me. He sed it was deth. He sed his
      faather laed miety sik wuns, and sum of them catched a berd, and his oeld
      grany sed his faather wuud die, and he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jim sed u mustn’t count th things u ar going to cuuk for
      diner, becauz that wuud bring bad luk. Th saem if u shuuk th
      taebl-clauth after sundoun. And he sed if a man oend a beehiev and
      that man died, th bees must be toeld about it befor sun-up next morning,
      or els th bees wuud all weeken doun and qit werk and die. Jim
      sed bees wouldn’t sting idiots; but I didn’t beleev that,
      becauz I had tried them lots of tiems mieself, and thay wouldn’t
      sting me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had herd about sum of thees things befor, but not all of them. Jim
      knowed all kiends of siens. He sed he knowed moest evrything. I
      sed it luukt to me liek all th siens was about bad luk, and so I askt
      him if thair worn’t eny guud-luk siens. He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Miety fue—an’ <i>day</i> ain’t no ues to a body.
      Whut u wont to noe when guud luk’s a-comin’ for?
      Wont to keep it off?” And he sed: “Ef u’s
      got hairy arms en a hairy breas’, it’s a sien dat u’s
      agwyne to be rich. Wel, day’s sum ues in a sien liek dat, ’kase
      it’s so fer ahed. U see, maybe u’s got to be po’ a

      ’f u didn’ noe bi de sien dat u gwyne to be rich bymeby.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hav u got hairy arms and a hairy brest, Jim?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut’s de ues to ax dat qeschun? Don’t u see I

    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, ar u rich?”

    <p>
      “No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. Wunst I
      had foteen dolars, but I tuk to specalat’n’, en got busted
      out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut did u specuelaet in, Jim?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, fust I takld stok.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut kiend of stok?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, liv stok—catl, u noe. I puut ten dolars in

      De cow up ’n’ died on mi han’s.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So u lost th ten dolars.”

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER IX.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonted to go and luuk at a plaes riet about th midl of th ieland
      that I’d found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to
      it, becauz th ieland was oenly three miels long and a qorter of a miel
      wied.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plaes was a tolerabl long, steep hil or rij about forty fuut
      hi. We had a ruf tiem geting to th top, th sieds was so steep and
      th buushes so thik. We trampt and clumb around all oever it, and bi
      and bi found a guud big cavern in th rok, moest up to th top on th sied
      tords Illinois. Th cavern was as big as too or three rooms
      buncht together, and Jim cuud stand up straet in it. It was cool
      in thair. Jim was for puuting our traps in thair riet away, but I sed we
      didn’t wont to be clieming up and doun thair all th tiem.
    </p>

      Jim sed if we had th canoo hid in a guud plaes, and had all th traps in
      th cavern, we cuud rush thair if enybody was to cum to th ieland, and
      thay wuud never fiend us without daugs. And, besieds, he sed them
      litl berds had sed it was going to raen, and did I wont th things to
      get wet?
    </p>
    <p>
      So we went bak and got th canoo, and paddled up abrest th cavern, and
      lugd all th traps up thair. Then we hunted up a plaes cloez bi to
      hied th canoo in, amungst th thik wiloes. We tuuk sum fish off
      of th liens and set them agen, and begun to get redy for diner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th dor of th cavern was big enuf to roel a hogzhed in, and on wun
      sied of th dor th flor stuk out a litl bit, and was flat and a guud
      plaes to bild a fier on. So we bilt it thair and cuukt diner.

      We spred th blankets insied for a carpet, and eet our diner in thair.
      We puut all th uther things handy at th bak of th cavern. Prity
      soon it darkend up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so th berds was
      riet about it. Directly it begun to raen, and it raend liek all
      fuery, too, and I never see th wiend blo so. It was wun of thees
      reguelar sumer storms. It wuud get so dark that it luukt all
      bloo-blak outsied, and luvly; and th raen wuud thrash along bi so
      thik that th trees off a litl ways luukt dim and spieder-webby; and
      heer wuud cum a blast of wiend that wuud bend th trees doun and tern up
      th pael undersied of th leevs; and then a perfect ripper of a gust
      wuud folo along and set th branches to tossing thair arms as if thay
      was just wield; and next, when it was just about th bluest and blakest—<i>FST</i>!
      it was as briet as glory, and u’d hav a litl glimps of
      tree-tops a-plunjing about away off yonder in th storm, hundreds of yards
      ferther than u cuud see befor; dark as sin agen in a second, and now
      u’d heer th thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go
      rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, doun th skie tords th under sied of th
      werld, liek roeling empty barrels doun stairs—whair it’s long
      stairs and thay bouns a guud deel, u noe.

      “Jim, this is nies,” I sez. “I wouldn’t wont to
      be noewhair els but heer. Pas me along anuther hunk of fish and sum hot
      corn-bred.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, u wouldn’t a ben heer ’f it hadn’t a ben
      for Jim. U’d a ben doun dah in de wuuds widout eny diner,
      en gittn’ mos’ drownded, too; dat u wuud, huny. Chikens
      noes when it’s gwyne to raen, en so do de berds, chile.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th river went on raezing and raezing for ten or twelv days, til at last
      it was oever th banks. Th wauter was three or foer fuut deep on th
      ieland in th lo plaeses and on th Illinois botom. On that sied it
      was a guud meny miels wied, but on th Missouri sied it was th saem oeld
      distans across—a haf a miel—becauz th Missouri shor was
      just a wall of hi blufs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daytimes we paddled all oever th ieland in th canoo, It was miety cool
      and shaedy in th deep wuuds, eeven if th sun was blaezing outsied. We
      went wiending in and out amungst th trees, and sumtiems th viens hung so
      thik we had to bak away and go sum uther way. Wel, on evry oeld
      broeken-doun tree u cuud see rabits and snaeks and such things; and
      when th ieland had bin oeverfloed a day or too thay got so taem, on
      acount of being hunggry, that u cuud padl riet up and puut yur hand
      on them if u wonted to; but not th snaeks and tertls—thay wuud
      slied off in th wauter. Th rij our cavern was in was fuul of
      them. We cuud a had pets enuf if we’d wonted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wun niet we catched a litl secshun of a lumber raft—nies pien
      planks. It was twelv fuut wied and about fifteen or sixteen fuut long,
      and th top stuud abuv wauter six or seven inches—a solid, level
      flor. We cuud see saw-logs go bi in th dayliet sumtiems, but we
      let them go; we didn’t sho ourselvs in dayliet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anuther niet when we was up at th hed of th ieland, just befor
      dayliet, heer cums a fraem-hous doun, on th west sied. She was a
      too-story, and tilted oever considerabl. We paddled out and got
      abord—clumb in at an upstairs windo. But it was too dark to
      see yet, so we maed th canoo fast and set in her to waet for dayliet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th liet begun to cum befor we got to th fuut of th ieland. Then
      we luukt in at th windo. We cuud maek out a bed, and a taebl,
      and too oeld chairs, and lots of things around about on th flor, and
      thair was cloeths hanging agenst th wall. Thair was sumthing
      laying on th flor in th far corner that luukt liek a man. So Jim
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Helo, u!”
    </p>
    <p>
      But it didn’t buj. So I holerd agen, and then Jim sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “De man ain’t asleep—he’s ded. U hoeld
      stil—I’ll go en see.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He went, and bent doun and luukt, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a ded man. Yes, indeedy; naeked, too. He’s
      ben shot in de bak. I reck’n he’s ben ded too er three days.
      Cum in, Huck, but doan’ luuk at his faes—it’s too
      gashly.”

      I didn’t luuk at him at all. Jim throwed sum oeld rags oever
      him, but he needn’t dun it; I didn’t wont to see him. Thair
      was heeps of oeld greezy cards scaterd around oever th flor, and oeld
      whisky botls, and a cupl of masks maed out of blak clauth; and all
      oever th walls was th ignorantest kiend of werds and pikchers maed with
      charcoel. Thair was too oeld derty calico dreses, and a sun-bonet,
      and sum wimen’s undercloeths hanging agenst th wall, and sum men’s
      cloething, too. We puut th lot into th canoo—it miet cum
      guud. Thair was a boy’s oeld spekld straw hat on th flor; I
      tuuk that, too. And thair was a botl that had had milk in it, and
      it had a rag stoper for a baeby to suk. We wuud a tuuk th botl,
      but it was broek. Thair was a seedy oeld chest, and an oeld hair trunk
      with th hinjes broek. Thay stuud oepen, but thair worn’t
      nuthing left in them that was eny acount. Th way things was
      scaterd about we rekond th peepl left in a hery, and worn’t
      fixt so as to carry off moest of thair stuf.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got an oeld tin lantern, and a buucher-nief without eny handl, and a
      bran-nue Barlow nief werth too bits in eny stor, and a lot of talo
      candls, and a tin candlstik, and a gord, and a tin cup, and a ratty
      oeld bedquilt off th bed, and a reticuel with needls and pins and beeswax
      and butons and thred and all such truk in it, and a hachet and sum
      naels, and a fishline as thik as mi litl fingger with sum monstrus
      huuks on it, and a roel of bukskin, and a lether daug-colar, and a
      hors-shoo, and sum vials of medisin that didn’t hav no laebel on
      them; and just as we was leeving I found a tolerabl guud cury-coem, and
      Jim he found a ratty oeld fidl-bo, and a wuuden leg. Th straps
      was broek off of it, but, baring that, it was a guud enuf leg, tho
      it was too long for me and not long enuf for Jim, and we couldn’t
      fiend th uther wun, tho we hunted all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, taek it all around, we maed a guud hall. When we was redy
      to shuv off we was a qorter of a miel belo th ieland, and it was
      prity braud day; so I maed Jim lay doun in th canoo and cuver up with
      th qilt, becauz if he set up peepl cuud tel he was a nigger a guud
      ways off. I paddled oever to th Illinois shor, and drifted doun
      moest a haf a miel doing it. I crept up th ded wauter under th
      bank, and hadn’t no acsidents and didn’t see noebody. We
      got hoem all saef.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER X.
    </p>
    <p>
      After brekfast I wonted to tauk about th ded man and ges out how he
      cum to be kild, but Jim didn’t wont to. He sed it wuud
      fech bad luk; and besieds, he sed, he miet cum and haa’nt us; he
      sed a man that worn’t berryd was mor liekly to go a-haa’nting
      around than wun that was planted and cumfortabl. That sounded
      prity reezonabl, so I didn’t say no mor; but I couldn’t
      keep frum studying oever it and wishing I knowed hoo shot th man, and whut
      thay dun it for.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rumejd th cloeths we’d got, and found aet dolars in silver
      soed up in th liening of an oeld blanket oevercoet. Jim sed he
      rekond th peepl in that hous stoel th coet, becauz if thay’d
      a knowed th muny was thair thay wouldn’t a left it. I sed I
      rekond thay kild him, too; but Jim didn’t wont to tauk about
      that. I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now u think it’s bad luk; but whut did u say when I
      fetched in th snaek-skin that I found on th top of th rij day befor
      yesterday? U sed it was th werst bad luk in th werld to tuch a
      snaek-skin with mi hands. Wel, heer’s yur bad luk! We’ve
      raekt in all this truk and aet dolars besieds. I wish we cuud
      hav sum bad luk liek this evry day, Jim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never u miend, huny, never u miend. Don’t u git
      too peart. It’s a-comin’. Miend I tel u, it’s
      a-comin’.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It did cum, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that tauk. Wel,
      after diner Friday we was laying around in th gras at th uper end of
      th rij, and got out of tobaco. I went to th cavern to get sum,
      and found a ratlsnaek in thair. I kild him, and curld him up on
      th fuut of Jim’s blanket, ever so nacheral, thinking thair’d
      be sum fun when Jim found him thair. Wel, bi niet I forgot all
      about th snaek, and when Jim flung himself doun on th blanket whiel I
      struk a liet th snaek’s maet was thair, and bit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumpt up yeling, and th ferst thing th liet shoed was th varmint
      curld up and redy for anuther spring. I laed him out in a second
      with a stik, and Jim grabd pap’s whisky-jug and begun to por it
      doun.

      He was bairfuuted, and th snaek bit him riet on th heel. That all
      cums of mi being such a fool as to not remember that whairever u leev a
      ded snaek its maet allways cums thair and curls around it. Jim toeld
      me to chop off th snaek’s hed and thro it away, and then skin th
      body and roest a pees of it. I dun it, and he eet it and sed it
      wuud help cuer him. He maed me taek off th ratls and tee them around
      his rist, too. He sed that that wuud help. Then I slid out
      qieet and throwed th snaeks cleer away amungst th buushes; for I worn’t
      going to let Jim fiend out it was all mi fallt, not if I cuud help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim sukt and sukt at th jug, and now and then he got out of his hed
      and picht around and yeld; but evry tiem he cum to himself he went
      to suking at th jug agen. His fuut sweld up prity big, and so
      did his leg; but bi and bi th drunk begun to cum, and so I jujd he was
      all riet; but I’d druther bin bit with a snaek than pap’s
      whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim was laed up for foer days and niets. Then th sweling was all
      gon and he was around agen. I maed up mi miend I wouldn’t
      ever taek a-holt of a snaek-skin agen with mi hands, now that I see whut
      had cum of it. Jim sed he rekond I wuud beleev him next tiem. And
      he sed that handling a snaek-skin was such awful bad luk that maybe we
      hadn’t got to th end of it yet. He sed he druther see th
      nue moon oever his left shoelder as much as a thouzand tiems than taek up a
      snaek-skin in his hand. Wel, I was geting to feel that way mieself,
      tho I’ve allways rekond that luuking at th nue moon oever yur
      left shoelder is wun of th carelessest and foolishest things a body can
      do. Oeld Hank Bunker dun it wuns, and bragd about it; and in les
      than too yeers he got drunk and fel off of th shot-tower, and spred
      himself out so that he was just a kiend of a layer, as u may say; and
      thay slid him ejways between too barn dors for a coffin, and berryd him
      so, so thay say, but I didn’t see it. Pap toeld me. But
      enyway it all cum of luuking at th moon that way, liek a fool.

      Wel, th days went along, and th river went doun between its banks
      agen; and about th ferst thing we dun was to baet wun of th big huuks
      with a skind rabit and set it and cach a catfish that was as big as a
      man, being six fuut too inches long, and wayd oever too hundred pounds.
      We couldn’t handl him, of cors; he wuud a flung us into
      Illinois. We just set thair and wocht him rip and teer around til
      he drownded. We found a bras buton in his stumac and a round
      ball, and lots of rubbage. We split th ball oepen with th hachet,
      and thair was a spool in it. Jim sed he’d had it thair a long
      tiem, to coet it oever so and maek a ball of it. It was as big a fish
      as was ever catched in th Mississippi, I rekon. Jim sed he hadn’t
      ever seen a biger wun. He wuud a bin werth a guud deel oever at
      th vilej. Thay pedl out such a fish as that bi th pound in th
      market-hous thair; evrybody bies sum of him; his meet’s as whiet
      as sno and maeks a guud fri.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I sed it was geting slo and dul, and I wonted to get a
      stering up sum way. I sed I rekond I wuud slip oever th river
      and fiend out whut was going on. Jim liekt that noeshun; but he sed I
      must go in th dark and luuk sharp. Then he studyd it oever and
      sed, couldn’t I puut on sum of them oeld things and dres up liek a
      gerl? That was a guud noeshun, too. So we shortend up wun of
      th calico gouns, and I ternd up mi trouzer-legs to mi nees and got into
      it. Jim hicht it behiend with th huuks, and it was a fair fit.
      I puut on th sun-bonet and tied it under mi chin, and then for a
      body to luuk in and see mi faes was liek luuking doun a joint of
      stoev-piep. Jim sed noebody wuud noe me, eeven in th daytiem,
      hardly. I practist around all day to get th hang of th things,
      and bi and bi I cuud do prity wel in them, oenly Jim sed I didn’t
      wauk liek a gerl; and he sed I must qit puuling up mi goun to get at mi

    <p>
      I started across to th toun frum a litl belo th ferry-landing, and
      th drift of th curent fetched me in at th botom of th toun. I
      tied up and started along th bank. Thair was a liet berning in a
      litl shanty that hadn’t bin livd in for a long tiem, and I
      wunderd hoo had tuuk up qorters thair. I slipt up and peeped in
      at th windo. Thair was a wuuman about forty yeer oeld in thair

    <p>
      “No,” I sez; “I’ll rest a whiel, I rekon, and go
      on. I ain’t afeared of th dark.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She sed she wouldn’t let me go bi mieself, but her huzband wuud be
      in bi and bi, maybe in a our and a haf, and she’d send him along
      with me. Then she got to tauking about her huzband, and about her
      relaeshuns up th river, and her relaeshuns doun th river, and about how
      much beter off thay uezd to was, and how thay didn’t noe but thay’d
      maed a mistaek cuming to our toun, insted of leting wel aloen—and
      so on and so on, til I was afeard I had maed a mistaek cuming to her to
      fiend out whut was going on in th toun; but bi and bi she dropt on to
      pap and th merder, and then I was prity wiling to let her clater riet
      along. She toeld about me and Tom Sawyer fiending th six thouzand
      dolars (oenly she got it ten) and all about pap and whut a hard lot he
      was, and whut a hard lot I was, and at last she got doun to whair I was
      merderd. I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoo dun it? We’ve herd considerabl about thees
      goings on doun in Hookerville, but we don’t noe hoo ’twas
      that kild Huck Finn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I rekon thair’s a riet smart chans of peepl <i>heer</i>
      that’d liek to noe hoo kild him. Sum think oeld Finn dun
      it himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No—is that so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Moest evrybody thaut it at ferst. He’ll never noe
      how ni he cum to geting lincht. But befor niet thay chaenjd
      around and jujd it was dun bi a runaway nigger naemd Jim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi <i>he</i>—”
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopt. I rekond I beter keep stil. She run on, and
      never noetist I had puut in at all:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th nigger run off th verry niet Huck Finn was kild. So
      thair’s a reword out for him—three hundred dolars. And
      thair’s a reword out for oeld Finn, too—too hundred dolars.
      U see, he cum to toun th morning after th merder, and toeld
      about it, and was out with ’em on th ferryboet hunt, and riet away
      after he up and left. Befor niet thay wonted to linch him, but he
      was gon, u see. Wel, next day thay found out th nigger was
      gon; thay found out he hadn’t ben seen sence ten o’clok th
      niet th merder was dun. So then thay puut it on him, u see; and
      whiel thay was fuul of it, next day, bak cums oeld Finn, and went
      boo-hooing to Juj Thatcher to get muny to hunt for th nigger all oever
      Illinois with. Th juj gaev him sum, and that eevning he got drunk, and
      was around til after midniet with a cupl of miety hard-luuking
      straenjers, and then went off with them. Wel, he hain’t cum
      bak sence, and thay ain’t luuking for him bak til this thing
      bloes oever a litl, for peepl thinks now that he kild his boy and
      fixt things so foeks wuud think robers dun it, and then he’d get
      Huck’s muny without having to bother a long tiem with a lawsoot.
      Peepl do say he worn’t eny too guud to do it. O, he’s
      sli, I rekon. If he don’t cum bak for a yeer he’ll be
      all riet. U can’t proov enything on him, u noe;
      evrything wil be qieeted doun then, and he’ll wauk in Huck’s
      muny as eezy as nuthing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I rekon so, ’m. I don’t see nuthing in th
      way of it. Has evrybody qit thinking th nigger dun it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, no, not evrybody. A guud meny thinks he dun it. But
      thay’ll get th nigger prity soon now, and maybe thay can scair it
      out of him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, ar thay after him yet?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, u’re inosent, ain’t u! Duz three
      hundred dolars lay around evry day for peepl to pik up? Sum
      foeks think th nigger ain’t far frum heer. I’m wun of
      them—but I hain’t taukt it around. A fue days ago I was
      tauking with an oeld cupl that lievs next dor in th log shanty, and
      thay hapend to say hardly enybody ever goes to that ieland oever yonder
      that thay call Jackson’s Ieland. Don’t enybody liv
      thair? sez I. No, noebody, sez thay. I didn’t say eny mor,
      but I dun sum thinking. I was prity neer serten I’d seen
      smoek oever thair, about th hed of th ieland, a day or too befor that,
      so I sez to mieself, liek as not that nigger’s hieding oever thair;
      enyway, sez I, it’s werth th trubl to giv th plaes a hunt.
      I hain’t seen eny smoek sence, so I rekon maybe he’s
      gon, if it was him; but huzband’s going oever to see—him and
      anuther man. He was gon up th river; but he got bak to-day, and I
      toeld him as soon as he got heer too ours ago.”

      I had got so uneezy I couldn’t set stil. I had to do
      sumthing with mi hands; so I tuuk up a needl off of th taebl and went
      to threding it. Mi hands shuuk, and I was maeking a bad job of it. When
      th wuuman stopt tauking I luukt up, and she was luuking at me prity
      cuerius and smieling a litl. I puut doun th needl and thred, and
      let on to be interested—and I was, too—and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Three hundred dolars is a power of muny. I wish mi muther
      cuud get it. Is yur huzband going oever thair to-niet?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, yes. He went up-toun with th man I was teling u of,
      to get a boet and see if thay cuud borro anuther gun. Thay’ll
      go oever after midniet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Couldn’t thay see beter if thay was to waet til daytiem?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes. And couldn’t th nigger see beter, too? After
      midniet he’ll liekly be asleep, and thay can slip around thru
      th wuuds and hunt up his camp fier all th beter for th dark, if he’s
      got wun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I didn’t think of that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th wuuman kept luuking at me prity cuerius, and I didn’t feel a bit
      cumfortabl. Prity soon she sez,
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut did u say yur naem was, huny?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M—Mary Williams.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Sumhow it didn’t seem to me that I sed it was Mary befor, so I
      didn’t luuk up—seemd to me I sed it was Sarah; so I felt
      sort of cornerd, and was afeared maybe I was luuking it, too. I
      wisht th wuuman wuud say sumthing mor; th longger she set stil th
      uneasier I was. But now she sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Huny, I thaut u sed it was Sarah when u ferst cum in?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, yes’m, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah’s
      mi ferst naem. Sum calls me Sarah, sum calls me Mary.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, that’s th way of it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes’m.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was feeling beter then, but I wisht I was out of thair, enyway. I
      couldn’t luuk up yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, th wuuman fel to tauking about how hard tiems was, and how pur
      thay had to liv, and how th rats was as free as if thay oend th plaes,
      and so forth and so on, and then I got eezy agen. She was riet
      about th rats. U’d see wun stik his noez out of a hoel in th
      corner evry litl whiel. She sed she had to hav things handy to
      thro at them when she was aloen, or thay wouldn’t giv her no
      pees. She shoed me a bar of leed twisted up into a not, and sed
      she was a guud shot with it generly, but she’d rencht her arm a
      day or too ago, and didn’t noe whether she cuud thro troo now.
      But she wocht for a chans, and directly bangd away at a rat; but
      she mist him wied, and sed “Ouch!” it hert her arm so.
      Then she toeld me to tri for th next wun. I wonted to be
      geting away befor th oeld man got bak, but of cors I didn’t let
      on. I got th thing, and th ferst rat that shoed his noez I let
      driev, and if he’d a stayd whair he was he’d a bin a
      tolerabl sik rat. She sed that was ferst-raet, and she rekond I
      wuud hiev th next wun. She went and got th lump of leed and
      fetched it bak, and braut along a hank of yarn which she wonted me to
      help her with. I held up mi too hands and she puut th hank oever
      them, and went on tauking about her and her huzband’s maters.
      But she broek off to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Keep yur ie on th rats. U beter hav th leed in yur
      lap, handy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So she dropt th lump into mi lap just at that moement, and I clapt mi
      legs together on it and she went on tauking. But oenly about a
      minit. Then she tuuk off th hank and luukt me straet in th faes, and
      verry plezant, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cum, now, whut’s yur reeal naem?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wh—whut, mum?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut’s yur reeal naem? Is it Bil, or Tom, or Bob?—or
      whut is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I rekon I shuuk liek a leef, and I didn’t noe hardly whut to do.
      But I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pleez to don’t poek fun at a pur gerl liek me, mum. If
      I’m in th way heer, I’ll—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, u wun’t. Set doun and stay whair u ar. I
      ain’t going to hert u, and I ain’t going to tel on u,
      nuther. U just tel me yur seecret, and trust me. I’ll
      keep it; and, whut’s mor, I’ll help u. So’ll mi oeld
      man if u wont him to. U see, u’re a runaway ’prentice,
      that’s all. It ain’t enything. Thair ain’t
      no harm in it. U’ve bin treeted bad, and u maed up yur miend to
      cut. Bles u, chield, I wouldn’t tel on u. Tel me
      all about it now, that’s a guud boy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So I sed it wouldn’t be no ues to tri to play it eny longger, and I
      wuud just maek a cleen brest and tel her evrything, but she musn’t
      go bak on her promis. Then I toeld her mi faather and muther was
      ded, and th law had bound me out to a meen oeld farmer in th cuntry
      therty miel bak frum th river, and he treeted me so bad I couldn’t
      stand it no longger; he went away to be gon a cupl of days, and so I
      tuuk mi chans and stoel sum of his dauter’s oeld cloeths and
      cleerd out, and I had bin three niets cuming th therty miels. I
      traveld niets, and hid daytimes and slept, and th bag of bred and meet
      I carryd frum hoem lasted me all th way, and I had a-plenty. I
      sed I beleevd mi unkl Abner Moore wuud taek cair of me, and so that
      was whi I struk out for this toun of Goshen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Goshen, chield? This ain’t Goshen. This is St.
      Petersburg. Goshen’s ten miel ferther up th river. Hoo
      toeld u this was Goshen?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, a man I met at daybraek this morning, just as I was going to
      tern into th wuuds for mi reguelar sleep. He toeld me when th roeds
      forkt I must taek th riet hand, and fiev miel wuud fech me to Goshen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He was drunk, I rekon. He toeld u just exactly rong.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, he did act liek he was drunk, but it ain’t no mater
      now. I got to be mooving along. I’ll fech Goshen befor
      dayliet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoeld on a minit. I’ll puut u up a snak to eet.
      U miet wont it.”

      So she puut me up a snak, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say, when a cow’s laying doun, which end of her gets up
      ferst? Anser up prompt now—don’t stop to study oever it.
      Which end gets up ferst?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th hiend end, mum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, a hors?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th for’rard end, mum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which sied of a tree duz th moss gro on?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “North sied.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If fifteen cows is brouzing on a hilsied, how meny of them eets
      with thair heds pointed th saem direcshun?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th hoel fifteen, mum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I rekon u <i>hav</i> livd in th cuntry. I
      thaut maybe u was trieing to hocus me agen. Whut’s yur
      reeal naem, now?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “George Peters, mum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, tri to remember it, George. Don’t forget and tel
      me it’s Elexander befor u go, and then get out bi saying it’s
      George Elexander when I cach u. And don’t go about wimen in
      that oeld calico. U do a gerl tolerabl pur, but u miet fool
      men, maybe. Bles u, chield, when u set out to thred a needl
      don’t hoeld th thred stil and fech th needl up to it; hoeld th
      needl stil and poek th thred at it; that’s th way a wuuman moest
      allways duz, but a man allways duz t’uther way. And when u
      thro at a rat or enything, hich yurself up a tiptoe and fech yur hand
      up oever yur hed as aukward as u can, and mis yur rat about six or
      seven fuut. Thro stif-armd frum th shoelder, liek thair was a pivot
      thair for it to tern on, liek a gerl; not frum th rist and elbo, with

      tries to cach enything in her lap she throes her nees apart; she don’t
      clap them together, th way u did when u catched th lump of leed.
      Whi, I spoted u for a boy when u was threding th needl; and
      I contrievd th uther things just to maek serten. Now trot along to
      yur unkl, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if u get
      into trubl u send werd to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I’ll
      do whut I can to get u out of it. Keep th river roed all th way,
      and next tiem u tramp taek shoos and soks with u. Th river roed’s
      a roky wun, and yur feet’ll be in a condishun when u get to
      Goshen, I rekon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up th bank about fifty yards, and then I dubld on mi traks and
      slipt bak to whair mi canoo was, a guud pees belo th hous. I
      jumpt in, and was off in a hery. I went up-streem far enuf to
      maek th hed of th ieland, and then started across. I tuuk off th
      sun-bonet, for I didn’t wont no blinders on then. When I was
      about th midl I herd th clok begin to striek, so I stops and
      lisens; th sound cum faent oever th wauter but cleer—eleven.
      When I struk th hed of th ieland I never waeted to blo, tho
      I was moest winded, but I shuvd riet into th timber whair mi oeld camp
      uezd to be, and started a guud fier thair on a hi and dri spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I jumpt in th canoo and dug out for our plaes, a miel and a haf
      belo, as hard as I cuud go. I landed, and slopt thru th
      timber and up th rij and into th cavern. Thair Jim laed, sound
      asleep on th ground. I rouzd him out and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Git up and hump yurself, Jim! Thair ain’t a minit to
      looz. Thay’re after us!”
    </p>

      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim never askt no qeschuns, he never sed a werd; but th way he werkt
      for th next haf an our shoed about how he was scaird. Bi that
      tiem evrything we had in th werld was on our raft, and she was redy to
      be shuvd out frum th wilo coev whair she was hid. We puut out th
      camp fier at th cavern th ferst thing, and didn’t sho a candl
      outsied after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tuuk th canoo out frum th shor a litl pees, and tuuk a luuk; but
      if thair was a boet around I couldn’t see it, for stars and shadoes
      ain’t guud to see bi. Then we got out th raft and slipt
      along doun in th shaed, past th fuut of th ieland ded stil—never
      saying a werd.

    </p>
    <p>
      It must a bin cloez on to wun o’clok when we got belo th ieland
      at last, and th raft did seem to go miety slo. If a boet was to
      cum along we was going to taek to th canoo and braek for th Illinois
      shor; and it was wel a boet didn’t cum, for we hadn’t ever
      thaut to puut th gun in th canoo, or a fishing-lien, or enything to
      eet. We was in ruther too much of a swet to think of so meny
      things. It worn’t guud jujment to puut <i>evrything</i> on
      th raft.
    </p>
    <p>
      If th men went to th ieland I just expect thay found th camp fier I
      bilt, and wocht it all niet for Jim to cum. Enyways, thay
      stayd away frum us, and if mi bilding th fier never foold them it worn’t
      no fallt of mien. I playd it as lo doun on them as I cuud.
    </p>
    <p>
      When th ferst streek of day began to sho we tied up to a toehed in a
      big bend on th Illinois sied, and hakt off cotonwuud branches with th
      hachet, and cuverd up th raft with them so she luukt liek thair had
      bin a caev-in in th bank thair. A toe-hed is a sandbar that has
      cottonwoods on it as thik as harro-teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had mountens on th Missouri shor and hevy timber on th Illinois
      sied, and th chanel was doun th Missouri shor at that plaes, so we
      worn’t afraed of enybody runing across us. We laed thair all
      day, and wocht th rafts and steamboats spin doun th Missouri shor,
      and up-bound steamboats fiet th big river in th midl. I toeld
      Jim all about th tiem I had jabering with that wuuman; and Jim sed she
      was a smart wun, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn’t
      set doun and woch a camp fier—no, ser, she’d fech a daug.
      Wel, then, I sed, whi couldn’t she tel her huzband to fech
      a daug? Jim sed he bet she did think of it bi th tiem th men was
      redy to start, and he beleevd thay must a gon up-toun to get a daug and
      so thay lost all that tiem, or els we wouldn’t be heer on a toehed
      sixteen or seventeen miel belo th vilej—no, indeedy, we wuud be
      in that saem oeld toun agen. So I sed I didn’t cair whut was
      th reezon thay didn’t get us as long as thay didn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was begining to cum on dark we poekt our heds out of th
      cotonwuud thiket, and luukt up and doun and across; nuthing in siet;
      so Jim tuuk up sum of th top planks of th raft and bilt a snug wigwom
      to get under in blaezing wether and raeny, and to keep th things dri. Jim
      maed a flor for th wigwom, and raezd it a fuut or mor abuv th level
      of th raft, so now th blankets and all th traps was out of reech of
      steemboet waevs. Riet in th midl of th wigwom we maed a layer
      of dert about fiev or six inches deep with a fraem around it for to hoeld
      it to its plaes; this was to bild a fier on in slopy wether or chily;
      th wigwom wuud keep it frum being seen. We maed an extra
      steering-or, too, becauz wun of th uthers miet get broek on a snag or
      sumthing. We fixt up a short forkt stik to hang th oeld lantern on,
      becauz we must allways liet th lantern whenever we see a steemboet
      cuming doun-streem, to keep frum geting run oever; but we wouldn’t
      hav to liet it for up-streem boets unles we see we was in whut thay
      call a “crossing”; for th river was prity hi yet, verry lo
      banks being stil a litl under wauter; so up-bound boets didn’t
      allways run th chanel, but hunted eezy wauter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This second niet we run between seven and aet ours, with a curent
      that was maeking oever foer miel an our. We catched fish and taukt,
      and we tuuk a swim now and then to keep off sleepynes. It was kiend
      of solem, drifting doun th big, stil river, laying on our baks luuking
      up at th stars, and we didn’t ever feel liek tauking loud, and it
      worn’t offen that we laft—oenly a litl kiend of a lo
      chukl. We had miety guud wether as a jeneral thing, and nuthing
      ever hapend to us at all—that niet, nor th next, nor th next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evry niet we past touns, sum of them away up on blak hillsides,
      nuthing but just a shieny bed of liets; not a hous cuud u see. Th
      fifth niet we past St. Louis, and it was liek th hoel werld lit up.
      In St. Petersburg thay uezd to say thair was twenty or therty thouzand
      peepl in St. Louis, but I never beleevd it til I see that wunderful
      spred of liets at too o’clok that stil niet. Thair worn’t
      a sound thair; evrybody was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evry niet now I uezd to slip ashor tords ten o’clok at sum
      litl vilej, and bi ten or fifteen sents’ werth of meel or baecon
      or uther stuf to eet; and sumtiems I lifted a chiken that worn’t
      roosting cumfortabl, and tuuk him along. Pap allways sed, taek a
      chiken when u get a chans, becauz if u don’t wont him
      yurself u can eezy fiend sumbody that duz, and a guud deed ain’t
      ever forgot. I never see pap when he didn’t wont th chiken
      himself, but that is whut he uezd to say, enyway.

      Mornings befor dayliet I slipt into cornfields and borroed a
      wautermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or sum nue corn, or things of
      that kiend. Pap allways sed it worn’t no harm to borro things
      if u was meening to pay them bak sum tiem; but th wido sed it worn’t
      enything but a sofft naem for steeling, and no deesent body wuud do it.
      Jim sed he rekond th wido was partly riet and pap was partly
      riet; so th best way wuud be for us to pik out too or three things
      frum th list and say we wouldn’t borro them eny mor—then he
      rekond it wouldn’t be no harm to borro th uthers. So we
      taukt it oever all wun niet, drifting along doun th river, trieing to
      maek up our miends whether to drop th watermelons, or th cantelopes, or
      th mushmelons, or whut. But tords dayliet we got it all setld
      satisfactory, and conclooded to drop crabapples and p’simmons. We
      worn’t feeling just riet befor that, but it was all cumfortabl
      now. I was glad th way it cum out, too, becauz crabapples ain’t
      ever guud, and th p’simmons wouldn’t be riep for too or three
      munths yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shot a wauter-foul now and then that got up too erly in th morning or
      didn’t go to bed erly enuf in th eevning. Taek it all
      round, we livd prity hi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th fifth niet belo St. Louis we had a big storm after midniet, with a
      power of thunder and lietning, and th raen pord doun in a solid sheet.
      We stayd in th wigwom and let th raft taek cair of itself. When th
      lietning glaird out we cuud see a big straet river ahed, and hi,
      roky blufs on boeth sieds. Bi and bi sez I, “Hel-<i>lo</i>,
      Jim, luuky yonder!” It was a steemboet that had kild herself on a
      rok. We was drifting straet doun for her. Th lietning
      shoed her verry distinkt. She was leening oever, with part of her
      uper dek abuv wauter, and u cuud see evry litl chimbly-gi cleen
      and cleer, and a chair bi th big bel, with an oeld slouch hat hanging on
      th bak of it, when th flashes cum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, it being away in th niet and stormy, and all so misteerius-liek, I
      felt just th way eny uther boy wuud a felt when I see that rek laying
      thair so mornful and loensum in th midl of th river. I wonted
      to get abord of her and slink around a litl, and see whut thair was
      thair. So I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Le’s land on her, Jim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jim was ded agenst it at ferst. He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I doan’ wont to go fool’n ’long er no rak.
      We’s doin’ blaem’ wel, en we beter let blaem’ 
      wel aloen, as de guud buuk sez. Liek as not day’s a wochman
      on dat rak.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wochman yur grandmuther,” I sez; “thair ain’t
      nuthing to woch but th texas and th pielot-hous; and do u rekon
      enybody’s going to resk his lief for a texas and a pielot-hous such
      a niet as this, when it’s liekly to braek up and wosh off doun th
      river eny minit?” Jim couldn’t say nuthing to that, so
      he didn’t tri. “And besieds,” I sez, “we miet
      borro sumthing werth having out of th capten’s staetroom. Seegars,
      I bet u—and cost fiev sents apees, solid cash. Steemboet
      captens is allways rich, and get sixty dolars a munth, and <i>thay</i>
      don’t cair a sent whut a thing costs, u noe, long as thay wont
      it. Stik a candl in yur poket; I can’t rest, Jim, til we
      giv her a rumejing. Do u rekon Tom Sawyer wuud ever go bi this
      thing? Not for pi, he wouldn’t. He’d call it an
      advencher—that’s whut he’d call it; and he’d land
      on that rek if it was his last act. And wouldn’t he thro
      stiel into it?—wouldn’t he spred himself, nor nuthing? Whi,
      u’d think it was Christopher C’lumbus discuvering
      Kingdom-Cum. I wish Tom Sawyer <i>was</i> heer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim he grumbld a litl, but giv in. He sed we mustn’t tauk
      eny mor than we cuud help, and then tauk miety lo. Th lietning
      shoed us th rek agen just in tiem, and we fetched th stabboard
      derrik, and maed fast thair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th dek was hi out heer. We went sneeking doun th sloep of it to
      labboard, in th dark, tords th texas, feeling our way slo with our
      feet, and spreding our hands out to fend off th gies, for it was so dark
      we couldn’t see no sien of them. Prity soon we struk th
      forward end of th skieliet, and clumb on to it; and th next step fetched
      us in frunt of th capten’s dor, which was oepen, and bi Jimminy,
      away doun thru th texas-hall we see a liet! and all in th saem
      second we seem to heer lo voises in yonder!
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim whisperd and sed he was feeling powerful sik, and toeld me to cum
      along. I sez, all riet, and was going to start for th raft; but
      just then I herd a vois wael out and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, pleez don’t, boys; I swair I wun’t ever tel!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Anuther vois sed, prity loud:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a lie, Jim Terner. U’ve acted this way
      befor. U allways wont mor’n yur shair of th truk, and
      u’ve allways got it, too, becauz u’ve swor ’t if
      u didn’t u’d tel. But this tiem u’ve sed
      it jest wun tiem too meny. U’re th meenest, treacherousest
      hound in this cuntry.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bi this tiem Jim was gon for th raft. I was just a-biling with
      cueriosity; and I sez to mieself, Tom Sawyer wouldn’t bak out now,
      and so I wun’t eether; I’m a-going to see whut’s going
      on heer. So I dropt on mi hands and nees in th litl pasej,
      and crept aft in th dark til thair worn’t but wun staetroom
      betwixt me and th cross-hall of th texas. Then in thair I see a
      man strecht on th flor and tied hand and fuut, and too men standing
      oever him, and wun of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and th uther wun
      had a pistol. This wun kept pointing th pistol at th man’s
      hed on th flor, and saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’d <i>liek</i> to! And I orter, too—a meen
      skunk!”

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Th man on th flor wuud shrivel up and say, “O, pleez don’t,
      Bil; I hain’t ever goin’ to tel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And evry tiem he sed that th man with th lantern wuud laf and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      “’Deed u <i>ain’t!</i> U never sed no trooer
      thing ’n that, u bet u.” And wuns he sed: “Heer him
      beg! and yit if we hadn’t got th best of him and tied him he’d
      a kild us boeth. And whut <i>for</i>? Jist for noth’n.
      Jist becauz we stuud on our <i>riets</i>—that’s whut for.
      But I lay u ain’t a-goin’ to threten noebody eny mor,
      Jim Terner. Puut <i>up</i> that pistol, Bil.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bil sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t wont to, Jake Packard. I’m for killin’ 
      him—and didn’t he kil oeld Hatfield jist th saem way—and
      don’t he dezerv it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I don’t <i>wont</i> him kild, and I’ve got mi
      reezons for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bles yo’ hart for them werds, Jake Packard! I’ll
      never forgit u long’s I liv!” sez th man on th flor,
      sort of blubbering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Packard didn’t taek no noetis of that, but hung up his lantern on a
      nael and started tords whair I was thair in th dark, and moeshund Bil
      to cum. I crawfished as fast as I cuud about too yards, but th
      boet slanted so that I couldn’t maek verry guud tiem; so to keep frum
      geting run oever and catched I cralld into a staetroom on th uper sied.
      Th man caem a-pawing along in th dark, and when Packard got to mi
      staetroom, he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heer—cum in heer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And in he cum, and Bil after him. But befor thay got in I was up
      in th uper berth, cornerd, and sorry I cum. Then thay stuud
      thair, with thair hands on th lej of th berth, and taukt. I
      couldn’t see them, but I cuud tel whair thay was bi th whisky
      thay’d bin having. I was glad I didn’t drink whisky;
      but it wouldn’t maed much diferens enyway, becauz moest of th
      tiem thay couldn’t a treed me becauz I didn’t breeth. I
      was too scaird. And, besieds, a body <i>couldn’t</i> breeth
      and heer such tauk. Thay taukt lo and ernest. Bil wonted
      to kil Terner. He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “He’s sed he’ll tel, and he wil. If we was to
      giv boeth our shairs to him <i>now</i> it wouldn’t maek no
      diferens after th ro and th way we’ve servd him. Shor’s
      u’re born, he’ll tern Staet’s evidens; now u heer
      <i>me</i>. I’m for puuting him out of his trubls.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So’m I,” sez Packard, verry qieet.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Blaem it, I’d sorter begun to think u wasn’t. Wel,
      then, that’s all riet. Le’s go and do it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoeld on a minit; I hain’t had mi say yit. U lisen
      to me. Shooting’s guud, but thair’s qieeter ways if th thing’s
      <i>got</i> to be dun. But whut I say is this: it ain’t guud
      sens to go cort’n around after a hallter if u can git at whut u’re
      up to in sum way that’s jist as guud and at th saem tiem don’t
      bring u into no resks. Ain’t that so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U bet it is. But how u goin’ to manej it this
      tiem?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, mi iedeea is this: we’ll rusl around and gather
      up whutever pickins we’ve oeverluukt in th staterooms, and shuv
      for shor and hied th truk. Then we’ll waet. Now I say it
      ain’t a-goin’ to be mor’n too ours befo’ this
      rak braeks up and woshes off doun th river. See? He’ll be
      drownded, and wun’t hav noebody to blaem for it but his oen self.
      I rekon that’s a considerble siet beter ’n killin’ 
      of him. I’m unfaevorabl to killin’ a man as long as u
      can git aroun’ it; it ain’t guud sens, it ain’t guud
      morals. Ain’t I riet?”
    </p>

    <p>
      So thay started, and I lit out, all in a coeld swet, and scrambld
      forward. It was dark as pich thair; but I sed, in a kiend of a cors
      whisper, “Jim!” and he anserd up, riet at mi elbo, with a
      sort of a moen, and I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Qik, Jim, it ain’t no tiem for fooling around and moaning;
      thair’s a gang of merderers in yonder, and if we don’t hunt up
      thair boet and set her drifting doun th river so thees feloes can’t
      get away frum th rek thair’s wun of ’em going to be in a

      in a bad fix—for th sherrif ’ll get ’em. Qik—hery!
      I’ll hunt th labboard sied, u hunt th stabboard. U start

    </p>
    <p>
      “O, mi lordy, lordy! <i>raf’’</i>? Day ain’

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, I catched mi breth and moest faented. Shut up on a rek with
      such a gang as that! But it worn’t no tiem to be
      sentimentering. We’d <i>got</i> to fiend that boet now—had
      to hav it for ourselvs. So we went a-qaeking and shaeking doun th
      stabboard sied, and slo werk it was, too—seemd a week befor we
      got to th stern. No sien of a boet. Jim sed he didn’t
      beleev he cuud go eny ferther—so scaird he hadn’t hardly eny
      strength left, he sed. But I sed, cum on, if we get left on this
      rek we ar in a fix, shur. So on we prould agen. We struk
      for th stern of th texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along
      forwards on th skieliet, hanging on frum shuter to shuter, for th ej
      of th skieliet was in th wauter. When we got prity cloez to th
      cross-hall dor thair was th skif, shur enuf! I cuud just
      bairly see her. I felt ever so thankful. In anuther second I
      wuud a bin abord of her, but just then th dor oepend. Wun of
      th men stuk his hed out oenly about a cupl of fuut frum me, and I
      thaut I was gon; but he jerkt it in agen, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heev that blaem lantern out o’ siet, Bil!”
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung a bag of sumthing into th boet, and then got in himself and set
      doun. It was Packard. Then Bil <i>he</i> cum out and got in.
      Packard sez, in a lo vois:
    </p>
    <p>
      “All redy—shuv off!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn’t hardly hang on to th shuters, I was so weak. But
      Bil sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoeld on—’d u go thru him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No. Didn’t u?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No. So he’s got his shair o’ th cash yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, cum along; no ues to taek truk and leev muny.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say, wun’t he suspishun whut we’re up to?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe he wun’t. But we got to hav it enyway. Cum
      along.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So thay got out and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th dor slamd to becauz it was on th careend sied; and in a haf
      second I was in th boet, and Jim cum tumbling after me. I out with
      mi nief and cut th roep, and away we went!
    </p>
    <p>
      We didn’t tuch an or, and we didn’t speek nor whisper, nor
      hardly eeven breeth. We went gliding swift along, ded sielent, past
      th tip of th padl-box, and past th stern; then in a second or too
      mor we was a hundred yards belo th rek, and th darknes soekt her
      up, evry last sien of her, and we was saef, and knowed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we was three or foer hundred yards doun-streem we see th lantern
      sho liek a litl spark at th texas dor for a second, and we knowed bi
      that that th rascals had mist thair boet, and was begining to
      understand that thay was in just as much trubl now as Jim Terner was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Jim mand th ors, and we tuuk out after our raft. Now was
      th ferst tiem that I begun to wery about th men—I rekon I hadn’t
      had tiem to befor. I begun to think how dredful it was, eeven for
      merderers, to be in such a fix. I sez to mieself, thair ain’t
      no teling but I miet cum to be a merderer mieself yet, and then how
      wuud I liek it? So sez I to Jim:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th ferst liet we see we’ll land a hundred yards belo it or
      abuv it, in a plaes whair it’s a guud hieding-plaes for u and th
      skif, and then I’ll go and fix up sum kiend of a yarn, and get
      sumbody to go for that gang and get them out of thair scraep, so thay can
      be hung when thair tiem cums.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But that iedeea was a faeluer; for prity soon it begun to storm agen, and
      this tiem wers than ever. Th raen pord doun, and never a liet
      shoed; evrybody in bed, I rekon. We boomd along doun th river,
      woching for liets and woching for our raft. After a long tiem th
      raen let up, but th clouds stayd, and th lietning kept whimpering, and
      bi and bi a flash shoed us a blak thing ahed, floeting, and we maed for
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was th raft, and miety glad was we to get abord of it agen. We
      seen a liet now away doun to th riet, on shor. So I sed I wuud
      go for it. Th skif was haf fuul of plunder which that gang had stoel
      thair on th rek. We husld it on to th raft in a piel, and I
      toeld Jim to floet along doun, and sho a liet when he jujd he had gon
      about too miel, and keep it berning til I cum; then I mand mi ors and
      shuvd for th liet. As I got doun tords it three or foer mor
      shoed—up on a hilsied. It was a vilej. I cloezd in
      abuv th shor liet, and laed on mi ors and floeted. As I went bi
      I see it was a lantern hanging on th jackstaff of a dubl-hul
      ferryboet. I skimd around for th wochman, a-wundering
      whairabouts he slept; and bi and bi I found him roosting on th bitts
      forward, with his hed doun between his nees. I gaev his shoelder
      too or three litl shoves, and begun to cri.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sterd up in a kiend of a startlish way; but when he see it was oenly me
      he tuuk a guud gap and strech, and then he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Helo, whut’s up? Don’t cri, bub. Whut’s
      th trubl?”
    </p>

      Then I broek doun. He sez:

      “Thay’re—thay’re—ar u th wochman of th

    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” he sez, kiend of prity-wel-satisfied liek. “I’m

    <p>
      I struk for th liet, but as soon as he ternd th corner I went bak
      and got into mi skif and baeld her out, and then puuld up shor in th
      eezy wauter about six hundred yards, and tukt mieself in amung sum
      woodboats; for I couldn’t rest eezy til I cuud see th ferryboet
      start. But taek it all around, I was feeling ruther cumfortabl on
      acounts of taeking all this trubl for that gang, for not meny wuud a
      dun it. I wisht th wido knowed about it. I jujd she
      wuud be proud of me for helping thees rapscallions, becauz rapscallions
      and ded beets is th kiend th wido and guud peepl taeks th moest

    <p>
      Wel, befor long heer cums th rek, dim and dusky, slieding along doun!
      A kiend of coeld shiver went thru me, and then I struk out for her.
      She was verry deep, and I see in a minit thair worn’t much
      chans for enybody being aliev in her. I puuld all around her and
      holerd a litl, but thair wasn’t eny anser; all ded stil.
      I felt a litl bit hevy-hearted about th gang, but not much, for
      I rekond if thay cuud stand it I cuud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then heer cums th ferryboet; so I shuvd for th midl of th river on
      a long doun-streem slant; and when I jujd I was out of ie-reech I laed
      on mi ors, and luukt bak and see her go and smel around th rek for
      Mis Hooker’s remainders, becauz th capten wuud noe her unkl
      Hornback wuud wont them; and then prity soon th ferryboet giv it up
      and went for th shor, and I laed into mi werk and went a-booming doun
      th river.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did seem a powerful long tiem befor Jim’s liet shoed up; and
      when it did sho it luukt liek it was a thouzand miel off. Bi th
      tiem I got thair th skie was begining to get a litl gray in th eest;
      so we struk for an ieland, and hid th raft, and sunk th skif, and
      ternd in and slept liek ded peepl.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XIV.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bi and bi, when we got up, we ternd oever th truk th gang had stoel off
      of th rek, and found boots, and blankets, and cloeths, and all sorts of
      uther things, and a lot of buuks, and a spieglas, and three boxes of
      seegars. We hadn’t ever bin this rich befor in neether of
      our lievs. Th seegars was priem. We laed off all th
      afternoon in th wuuds tauking, and me reeding th buuks, and having a
      jeneral guud tiem. I toeld Jim all about whut hapend insied th rek and
      at th ferryboet, and I sed thees kiends of things was advenchers; but he
      sed he didn’t wont no mor advenchers. He sed that when I
      went in th texas and he cralld bak to get on th raft and found her
      gon he neerly died, becauz he jujd it was all up with <i>him</i>
      enyway it cuud be fixt; for if he didn’t get saevd he wuud get
      drownded; and if he did get saevd, hooever saevd him wuud send him bak
      hoem so as to get th reword, and then Mis Watson wuud sel him South,
      shur. Wel, he was riet; he was moest allways riet; he had an
      uncomon level hed for a nigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      I red considerabl to Jim about kings and dueks and earls and such, and
      how gaudy thay drest, and how much stiel thay puut on, and calld eech
      uther yur majesty, and yur graes, and yur lordship, and so on, ’sted
      of mister; and Jim’s ies bugd out, and he was interested. He
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I didn’ noe day was so meny un um. I hain’t
      hearn ’bout nun un um, skasely, but oelay King Sollermun, onless u
      counts dem kings dat’s in a pak er k’yards. How much do
      a king git?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Get?” I sez; “whi, thay get a thouzand dolars a
      munth if thay wont it; thay can hav just as much as thay wont; evrything
      belongs to them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ain’’</i> dat gay? En whut day got to do, Huck?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Thay</i> don’t do nuthing! Whi, how u tauk! Thay
      just set around.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; is dat so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of cors it is. Thay just set around—exsept, maybe,
      when thair’s a wor; then thay go to th wor. But uther tiems
      thay just laezy around; or go hawking—just hawking and sp—Sh!—d’ 
      u heer a noiz?”
    </p>
    <p>
      We skipt out and luukt; but it worn’t nuthing but th fluter of
      a steemboet’s wheel away doun, cuming around th point; so we cum
      bak.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” sez I, “and uther tiems, when things is dul,
      thay fus with th parlyment; and if evrybody don’t go just so he
      whacks thair heds off. But moestly thay hang round th hairem.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Roun’ de which?”
    </p>

      I never see such a nigger. If he got a noeshun in his hed wuns,
      thair worn’t no geting it out agen. He was th moest doun on
      Solomon of eny nigger I ever see. So I went to tauking about uther
      kings, and let Solomon slied. I toeld about Louis Sixteenth that got
      his hed cut off in France long tiem ago; and about his litl boy th
      dolfin, that wuud a bin a king, but thay tuuk and shut him up in jael,
      and sum say he died thair.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Po’ litl chap.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But sum sez he got out and got away, and cum to America.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dat’s guud! But he’ll be pooty loensum—day
      ain’ no kings heer, is day, Huck?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Den he cain’t git no sichuaeshun. Whut he gwyne to do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I don’t noe. Sum of them gets on th polees,
      and sum of them lerns peepl how to tauk French.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Huck, doan’ de French peepl tauk de saem way we duz?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>No</i>, Jim; u couldn’t understand a werd thay sed—not
      a singgl werd.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, now, I be ding-busted! How do dat cum?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t noe; but it’s so. I got sum of thair
      jaber out of a buuk. S’poez a man was to cum to u and say
      Polly-voo-franzy—whut wuud u think?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wouldn’ think nuff’n; I’d taek en bust him oever
      de hed—dat is, if he worn’t whiet. I wouldn’t
      ’lo no nigger to call me dat.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shuks, it ain’t calling u enything. It’s oenly
      saying, do u noe how to tauk French?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, den, whi couldn’t he <i>say</i> it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, he <i>is</i> a-saying it. That’s a Frenchman’s
      <i>way</i> of saying it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, it’s a blaem ridicklous way, en I doan’ wont to
      heer no mo’ ’bout it. Day ain’ no sens in it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Luuky heer, Jim; duz a cat tauk liek we do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, a cat don’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, duz a cow?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, a cow don’t, nuther.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Duz a cat tauk liek a cow, or a cow tauk liek a cat?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, day don’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s nacheral and riet for ’em to tauk diferent frum
      eech uther, ain’t it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cors.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And ain’t it nacheral and riet for a cat and a cow to tauk
      diferent frum <i>us</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, mos’ sholy it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, whi ain’t it nacheral and riet for a <i>Frenchman</i>
      to tauk diferent frum us? U anser me that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is a cat a man, Huck?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, den, day ain’t no sens in a cat talkin’ liek a
      man. Is a cow a man?—er is a cow a cat?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, she ain’t eether of them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, den, she ain’t got no biznes to tauk liek eether wun
      er th yuther of ’em. Is a Frenchman a man?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Wel</i>, den! Dad blaem it, whi doan’ he <i>tauk</i>

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XV.
    </p>
    <p>
      We jujd that three niets mor wuud fech us to Cairo, at th botom of
      Illinois, whair th Ohio River cums in, and that was whut we was after.
      We wuud sel th raft and get on a steemboet and go way up th Ohio
      amungst th free Staets, and then be out of trubl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, th second niet a fog begun to cum on, and we maed for a toehed
      to tee to, for it wouldn’t do to tri to run in a fog; but when I
      paddled ahed in th canoo, with th lien to maek fast, thair worn’t
      enything but litl saplings to tee to. I past th lien around wun
      of them riet on th ej of th cut bank, but thair was a stif curent,
      and th raft cum booming doun so lievly she tore it out bi th roots and
      away she went. I see th fog cloezing doun, and it maed me so sik
      and scaird I couldn’t buj for moest a haf a minit it seemd to me—and
      then thair worn’t no raft in siet; u couldn’t see twenty
      yards. I jumpt into th canoo and run bak to th stern, and
      grabd th padl and set her bak a stroek. But she didn’t
      cum. I was in such a hery I hadn’t untied her. I got
      up and tried to unti her, but I was so exsieted mi hands shuuk so I couldn’t
      hardly do enything with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I got started I tuuk out after th raft, hot and hevy, riet
      doun th toehed. That was all riet as far as it went, but th
      toehed worn’t sixty yards long, and th minit I floo bi th fuut
      of it I shot out into th solid whiet fog, and hadn’t no mor iedeea
      which way I was going than a ded man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinks I, it wun’t do to padl; ferst I noe I’ll run into
      th bank or a toehed or sumthing; I got to set stil and floet, and yet
      it’s miety fijety biznes to hav to hoeld yur hands stil at
      such a tiem. I whooped and lisend. Away doun thair
      somewheres I heers a small hoop, and up cums mi spirits. I went
      tairing after it, lisening sharp to heer it agen. Th next tiem it
      cum I see I worn’t heding for it, but heding away to th riet of
      it. And th next tiem I was heding away to th left of it—and
      not gaening on it much eether, for I was flieing around, this way and that
      and t’uther, but it was going straet ahed all th tiem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did wish th fool wuud think to beet a tin pan, and beet it all th
      tiem, but he never did, and it was th stil plaeses between th whoops
      that was maeking th trubl for me. Wel, I faut along, and
      directly I heers th hoop <i>behiend</i> me. I was tanggld guud now.
      That was sumbody els’s hoop, or els I was ternd around.
    </p>
    <p>
      I throwed th padl doun. I herd th hoop agen; it was behiend me
      yet, but in a diferent plaes; it kept cuming, and kept chaenjing its
      plaes, and I kept ansering, til bi and bi it was in frunt of me agen,
      and I knowed th curent had swung th canoo’s hed doun-streem, and
      I was all riet if that was Jim and not sum uther raftsman holering.
      I couldn’t tel nuthing about voises in a fog, for nuthing don’t
      luuk nacheral nor sound nacheral in a fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th hooping went on, and in about a minit I cum a-booming doun on a cut
      bank with smoeky goests of big trees on it, and th curent throwed me off
      to th left and shot bi, amungst a lot of snags that fairly rord, th
      currrent was tairing bi them so swift.
    </p>
    <p>
      In anuther second or too it was solid whiet and stil agen. I set
      perfectly stil then, lisening to mi hart thump, and I rekon I didn’t
      draw a breth whiel it thumpt a hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just giv up then. I knowed whut th mater was. That cut
      bank was an ieland, and Jim had gon doun t’uther sied of it. It
      worn’t no toehed that u cuud floet bi in ten minits. It
      had th big timber of a reguelar ieland; it miet be fiev or six miels long
      and mor than haf a miel wied.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept qieet, with mi eers cokt, about fifteen minits, I rekon. I
      was floeting along, of cors, foer or fiev miels an our; but u don’t
      ever think of that. No, u <i>feel</i> liek u ar laying ded
      stil on th wauter; and if a litl glimps of a snag slips bi u don’t
      think to yurself how fast <i>u’re</i> going, but u cach yur
      breth and think, mi! how that snag’s tairing along. If u
      think it ain’t dizmal and loensum out in a fog that way bi yurself
      in th niet, u tri it wuns—u’ll see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <a name="c15-117" id="c15-117"></a><br> <br>
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, for about a haf an our, I whoops now and then; at last I heers th
      anser a long ways off, and tries to folo it, but I couldn’t do
      it, and directly I jujd I’d got into a nest of toeheds, for I had
      litl dim glimpses of them on boeth sieds of me—sumtiems just a
      narro chanel between, and sum that I couldn’t see I knowed was
      thair becauz I’d heer th wosh of th curent agenst th oeld ded
      brush and trash that hung oever th banks. Wel, I worn’t long
      loosing th whoops doun amungst th toeheds; and I oenly tried to chaes
      them a litl whiel, enyway, becauz it was wers than chaesing a Jak-o’-lantern.
      U never knowed a sound doj around so, and swop plaeses so qik
      and so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to claw away frum th bank prity lievly foer or fiev tiems, to keep
      frum noking th ielands out of th river; and so I jujd th raft must
      be buting into th bank evry now and then, or els it wuud get ferther
      ahed and cleer out of heering—it was floeting a litl faster than
      whut I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, I seemd to be in th oepen river agen bi and bi, but I couldn’t
      heer no sien of a hoop nowheres. I rekond Jim had fetched up on a
      snag, maybe, and it was all up with him. I was guud and tierd, so I
      laed doun in th canoo and sed I wouldn’t bother no mor. I
      didn’t wont to go to sleep, of cors; but I was so sleepy I couldn’t
      help it; so I thaut I wuud taek jest wun litl cat-nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <a name="c15-118" id="c15-118"></a><br> <br>
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      But I rekon it was mor than a cat-nap, for when I waekt up th stars was
      shiening briet, th fog was all gon, and I was spining doun a big bend
      stern ferst. Ferst I didn’t noe whair I was; I thaut I was
      dreeming; and when things began to cum bak to me thay seemd to cum up
      dim out of last week.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a monstrus big river heer, with th tallest and th thikest kiend
      of timber on boeth banks; just a solid wall, as wel as I cuud see bi th
      stars. I luukt away doun-streem, and seen a blak spek on th
      wauter. I tuuk after it; but when I got to it it worn’t nuthing but a
      cupl of sawlogs maed fast together. Then I see anuther spek, and
      chaest that; then anuther, and this tiem I was riet. It was th
      raft.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got to it Jim was seting thair with his hed doun between his
      nees, asleep, with his riet arm hanging oever th steering-or. Th
      uther or was smasht off, and th raft was literd up with leevs and
      branches and dert. So she’d had a ruf tiem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I maed fast and laed doun under Jim’s noez on th raft, and began to
      gap, and strech mi fists out agenst Jim, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Helo, Jim, hav I bin asleep? Whi didn’t u ster me
      up?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guudnes graeshus, is dat u, Huck? En u ain’ ded—u
      ain’ drownded—u’s bak agin? It’s too guud
      for troo, huny, it’s too guud for troo. Lemme luuk at u chile,
      lemme feel o’ u. No, u ain’ ded! u’s bak
      agin, ’liv en soun’, jis de saem oelay Huck—de saem oelay
      Huck, thanks to guudnes!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut’s th mater with u, Jim? U bin a-drinking?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Drinkin’? Has I ben a-drinkin’? Has I had a
      chans to be a-drinkin’?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, whut maeks u tauk so wield?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How duz I tauk wield?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>How</i>? Whi, hain’t u bin tauking about mi
      cuming bak, and all that stuf, as if I’d bin gon away?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Huck—Huck Finn, u luuk me in de ie; luuk me in de ie.
      <i>Hain’t</i> u ben gon away?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gon away? Whi, whut in th naeshun do u meen? I hain’t
      bin gon anywheres. Whair wuud I go to?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, luuky heer, boss, day’s sumf’n rong, day is.
      Is I <i>me</i>, or hoo <i>is</i> I? Is I heah, or whah <i>is</i> I?
      Now dat’s whut I wonts to noe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I think u’re heer, plaen enuf, but I think u’re
      a tanggl-heded oeld fool, Jim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I is, is I? Wel, u anser me dis: Didn’t u
      toet out de lien in de canoo fer to maek fas’ to de toe-hed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I didn’t. Whut toe-hed? I hain’t see
      no toe-hed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U hain’t seen no toehed? Luuky heer, didn’t de
      lien puul loos en de raf’ go a-hummin’ doun de river, en
      leev u en de canoo behine in de fog?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut fog?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, de fog!—de fog dat’s bin aroun’ all niet.
      En didn’t u hoop, en didn’t I hoop, tel we got mix’ 
      up in de ielands en wun un us got los’ en t’uther wun was jis’ 
      as guud as los’, ’kase he didn’ noe whah he wuz? En
      didn’t I bust up agin a lot er dem ielands en hav a turrible tiem
      en mos’ git drownded? Now ain’ dat so, boss—ain’t
      it so? U anser me dat.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, this is too meny for me, Jim. I hain’t seen no
      fog, nor no ielands, nor no trubls, nor nuthing. I bin seting
      heer tauking with u all niet til u went to sleep about ten minits
      ago, and I rekon I dun th saem. U couldn’t a got drunk in
      that tiem, so of cors u’ve bin dreeming.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dad fech it, how is I gwyne to dreem all dat in ten minits?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, hang it all, u did dreem it, becauz thair didn’t eny
      of it hapen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, Huck, it’s all jis’ as plaen to me as—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It don’t maek no diferens how plaen it is; thair ain’t
      nuthing in it. I noe, becauz I’ve bin heer all th tiem.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim didn’t say nuthing for about fiev minits, but set thair
      studying oever it. Then he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, den, I reck’n I did dreem it, Huck; but daug mi cats ef
      it ain’t de powerfullest dreem I ever see. En I hain’t
      ever had no dreem b’fo’ dat’s tierd me liek dis wun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, wel, that’s all riet, becauz a dreem duz tier a body
      liek evrything sumtiems. But this wun was a staving dreem; tel me
      all about it, Jim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So Jim went to werk and toeld me th hoel thing riet thru, just as it
      hapend, oenly he paented it up considerabl. Then he sed he must
      start in and “’terpret” it, becauz it was sent for a
      worning. He sed th ferst toehed stuud for a man that wuud tri to
      do us sum guud, but th curent was anuther man that wuud get us away
      frum him. Th whoops was wornings that wuud cum to us evry now
      and then, and if we didn’t tri hard to maek out to understand them
      thay’d just taek us into bad luk, ’sted of keeping us out of
      it. Th lot of toeheds was trubls we was going to get into with
      qorrelsum peepl and all kiends of meen foeks, but if we miended our
      biznes and didn’t tauk bak and agravaet them, we wuud puul
      thru and get out of th fog and into th big cleer river, which was th
      free Staets, and wouldn’t hav no mor trubl.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had clouded up prity dark just after I got on to th raft, but it was
      cleering up agen now.
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, wel, that’s all interpreted wel enuf as far as it
      goes, Jim,” I sez; “but whut duz <i>thees</i> things stand
      for?”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was th leevs and rubish on th raft and th smasht or. U
      cuud see them ferst-raet now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim luukt at th trash, and then luukt at me, and bak at th trash
      agen. He had got th dreem fixt so strong in his hed that he
      couldn’t seem to shaek it loos and get th facts bak into its
      plaes agen riet away. But when he did get th thing straetend
      around he luukt at me stedy without ever smieling, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut do day stan’ for? I’se gwyne to tel u.
      When I got all wor out wid werk, en wid de callin’ for u,
      en went to sleep, mi hart wuz mos’ broek bekase u wuz los’,
      en I didn’ k’yer no’ mo’ whut becum er me en de
      raf’. En when I waek up en fien u bak agin, all saef en
      soun’, de teers cum, en I cuud a got doun on mi nees en kis yo’ 
      fuut, I’s so thankful. En all u wuz thinkin’ ’bout wuz
      how u cuud maek a fool uv oelay Jim wid a lie. Dat truk dah is <i>trash</i>;
      en trash is whut peepl is dat puuts dert on de hed er day fren’s en
      maeks ’em ashaemd.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he got up slo and waukt to th wigwom, and went in thair without
      saying enything but that. But that was enuf. It maed me feel
      so meen I cuud allmoest kist <i>his</i> fuut to get him to taek it bak.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fifteen minits befor I cuud werk mieself up to go and humbl
      mieself to a nigger; but I dun it, and I worn’t ever sorry for it
      afterwards, neether. I didn’t do him no mor meen triks, and
      I wouldn’t dun that wun if I’d a knowed it wuud maek him
      feel that way.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XVI.
    </p>
    <p>
      We slept moest all day, and started out at niet, a litl ways behiend a
      monstrus long raft that was as long going bi as a proseshun. She
      had foer long sweeps at eech end, so we jujd she carryd as meny as
      therty men, liekly. She had fiev big wigwams abord, wied apart, and
      an oepen camp fier in th midl, and a tall flag-poel at eech end. Thair
      was a power of stiel about her. It <i>amounted</i> to sumthing
      being a raftsman on such a craft as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went drifting doun into a big bend, and th niet clouded up and got
      hot. Th river was verry wied, and was walld with solid timber on
      boeth sieds; u couldn’t see a braek in it hardly ever, or a liet.
      We taukt about Cairo, and wunderd whether we wuud noe it when we
      got to it. I sed liekly we wouldn’t, becauz I had herd say
      thair worn’t but about a duzen houses thair, and if thay didn’t
      hapen to hav them lit up, how was we going to noe we was pasing a
      toun? Jim sed if th too big rivers joind together thair, that
      wuud sho. But I sed maybe we miet think we was pasing th fuut
      of an ieland and cuming into th saem oeld river agen. That disterbd Jim—and
      me too. So th qeschun was, whut to do? I sed, padl ashor
      th ferst tiem a liet shoed, and tel them pap was behiend, cuming along
      with a traeding-scow, and was a green hand at th biznes, and wonted to
      noe how far it was to Cairo. Jim thaut it was a guud iedeea, so we
      tuuk a smoek on it and waeted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thair worn’t nuthing to do now but to luuk out sharp for th toun,
      and not pas it without seeing it. He sed he’d be miety shur
      to see it, becauz he’d be a free man th minit he seen it, but if
      he mist it he’d be in a slaev cuntry agen and no mor sho for
      freedom. Evry litl whiel he jumps up and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dah she is?”
    </p>
    <p>
      But it worn’t. It was Jak-o’-lanterns, or lietning
      bugs; so he set doun agen, and went to woching, saem as befor. Jim
      sed it maed him all oever trembly and feeverish to be so cloez to freedom.
      Wel, I can tel u it maed me all oever trembly and feeverish, too,
      to heer him, becauz I begun to get it thru mi hed that he <i>was</i>
      moest free—and hoo was to blaem for it? Whi, <i>me</i>. I
      couldn’t get that out of mi conshens, no how nor no way. It got to
      trubling me so I couldn’t rest; I couldn’t stay stil in wun
      plaes. It hadn’t ever cum hoem to me befor, whut this thing
      was that I was doing. But now it did; and it stayd with me, and
      scorcht me mor and mor. I tried to maek out to mieself that I worn’t
      to blaem, becauz I didn’t run Jim off frum his rietful oener; but
      it worn’t no ues, conshens up and sez, evry tiem, “But u
      knowed he was runing for his freedom, and u cuud a paddled ashor and
      toeld sumbody.” That was so—I couldn’t get around
      that noeway. That was whair it pincht. Conshens sez to me,
      “Whut had pur Mis Watson dun to u that u cuud see her nigger
      go off riet under yur ies and never say wun singgl werd? Whut did
      that pur oeld wuuman do to u that u cuud treet her so meen? Whi,
      she tried to lern u yur buuk, she tried to lern u yur maners, she
      tried to be guud to u evry way she knowed how. <i>That’s</i>
      whut she dun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I got to feeling so meen and so mizerabl I moest wisht I was ded. I
      fidgeted up and doun th raft, abuezing mieself to mieself, and Jim was
      fidgeting up and doun past me. We neether of us cuud keep stil.
      Evry tiem he danst around and sez, “Dah’s Cairo!”
      it went thru me liek a shot, and I thaut if it <i>was</i> Cairo I
      rekond I wuud die of miserableness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim taukt out loud all th tiem whiel I was tauking to mieself. He
      was saying how th ferst thing he wuud do when he got to a free Staet he
      wuud go to saeving up muny and never spend a singgl sent, and when he got
      enuf he wuud bi his wief, which was oend on a farm cloez to whair
      Mis Watson livd; and then thay wuud boeth werk to bi th too children,
      and if thair master wouldn’t sel them, thay’d get an Ab’litionist
      to go and steel them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It moest froez me to heer such tauk. He wouldn’t ever daird to
      tauk such tauk in his lief befor. Just see whut a diferens it
      maed in him th minit he jujd he was about free. It was acording
      to th oeld saying, “Giv a nigger an inch and he’ll taek an
      el.” Thinks I, this is whut cums of mi not thinking. Heer
      was this nigger, which I had as guud as helpt to run away, cuming riet
      out flat-fuuted and saying he wuud steel his children—children that
      belongd to a man I didn’t eeven noe; a man that hadn’t ever
      dun me no harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sorry to heer Jim say that, it was such a loeering of him. Mi
      conshens got to stering me up hoter than ever, until at last I sez to
      it, “Let up on me—it ain’t too laet yet—I’ll
      padl ashor at th ferst liet and tel.” I felt eezy and
      hapy and liet as a fether riet off. All mi trubls was gon.
      I went to luuking out sharp for a liet, and sort of singing to
      mieself. Bi and bi wun shoed. Jim sings out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “We’s saef, Huck, we’s saef! Jump up and crak yo’ 
      heels! Dat’s de guud oelay Cairo at las’, I jis noes it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll taek th canoo and go and see, Jim. It mightn’t
      be, u noe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumpt and got th canoo redy, and puut his oeld coet in th botom for
      me to set on, and giv me th padl; and as I shuvd off, he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pooty soon I’ll be a-shout’n’ for joy, en I’ll
      say, it’s all on acounts o’ Huck; I’s a free man, en I
      couldn’t ever ben free ef it hadn’ ben for Huck; Huck dun it.
      Jim wun’t ever forgit u, Huck; u’s de bes’ 
      fren’ Jim’s ever had; en u’s de <i>oenly</i> fren’ 
      oelay Jim’s got now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was padling off, all in a swet to tel on him; but when he sez this,
      it seemd to kiend of taek th tuk all out of me. I went along slo
      then, and I worn’t riet doun serten whether I was glad I started
      or whether I worn’t. When I was fifty yards off, Jim sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dah u goes, de oelay troo Huck; de on’y whiet genlman dat
      ever kep’ his promis to oelay Jim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, I just felt sik. But I sez, I <i>got</i> to do it—I
      can’t get <i>out</i> of it. Riet then along cums a skif
      with too men in it with guns, and thay stopt and I stopt. Wun of
      them sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut’s that yonder?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A pees of a raft,” I sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do u belong on it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, ser.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Eny men on it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oenly wun, ser.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, thair’s fiev niggers run off to-niet up yonder, abuv
      th hed of th bend. Is yur man whiet or blak?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t anser up prompt. I tried to, but th werds wouldn’t
      cum. I tried for a second or too to braes up and out with it, but I worn’t
      man enuf—hadn’t th spunk of a rabit. I see I was
      weekening; so I just giv up trieing, and up and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “He’s whiet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I rekon we’ll go and see for ourselvs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wish u wuud,” sez I, “becauz it’s pap that’s
      thair, and maybe u’d help me toe th raft ashor whair th liet
      is. He’s sik—and so is mam and Mary Ann.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, th devil! we’re in a hery, boy. But I s’poez
      we’ve got to. Cum, bukl to yur padl, and let’s get
      along.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I bukld to mi padl and thay laed to thair ors. When we had maed
      a stroek or too, I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pap’ll be miety much obleeged to u, I can tel u. Evrybody
      goes away when I wont them to help me toe th raft ashor, and I can’t
      do it bi mieself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, that’s infernal meen. Od, too. Say, boy,
      whut’s th mater with yur faather?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s th—a—th—wel, it ain’t
      enything much.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay stopt puuling. It worn’t but a miety litl ways to
      th raft now. Wun sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Boy, that’s a lie. Whut <i>is</i> th mater with yur
      pap? Anser up sqair now, and it’ll be th beter for u.”

      “I wil, ser, I wil, onest—but don’t leev us, pleez.
      It’s th—th—Jentlmen, if u’ll oenly puul
      ahed, and let me heev u th hedlien, u wun’t hav to cum

    </p>
    <p>
      “Set her bak, John, set her bak!” sez wun. Thay
      bakt wauter. “Keep away, boy—keep to looard. Confound
      it, I just expect th wiend has blowed it to us. Yur pap’s got
      th small-pox, and u noe it preshus wel. Whi didn’t u
      cum out and say so? Do u wont to spred it all oever?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” sez I, a-blubbering, “I’ve toeld evrybody
      befor, and thay just went away and left us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pur devil, thair’s sumthing in that. We ar riet
      doun sorry for u, but we—wel, hang it, we don’t wont th
      small-pox, u see. Luuk heer, I’ll tel u whut to do.
      Don’t u tri to land bi yurself, or u’ll smash
      evrything to peeses. U floet along doun about twenty miels, and
      u’ll cum to a toun on th left-hand sied of th river. It
      wil be long after sun-up then, and when u ask for help u tel them
      yur foeks ar all doun with chils and feever. Don’t be a fool
      agen, and let peepl ges whut is th mater. Now we’re
      trieing to do u a kiendnes; so u just puut twenty miels between us, that’s
      a guud boy. It wouldn’t do eny guud to land yonder whair th
      liet is—it’s oenly a wuud-yard. Say, I rekon yur faather’s
      pur, and I’m bound to say he’s in prity hard luk. Heer,
      I’ll puut a twenty-dolar goeld pees on this bord, and u get it
      when it floets bi. I feel miety meen to leev u; but mi kingdom!
      it wun’t do to fool with small-pox, don’t u see?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoeld on, Parker,” sez th uther man, “heer’s a
      twenty to puut on th bord for me. Guud-bi, boy; u do as Mr.
      Parker toeld u, and u’ll be all riet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s so, mi boy—guud-bi, guud-bi. If u see
      eny runaway niggers u get help and nab them, and u can maek sum muny
      bi it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guud-bi, ser,” sez I; “I wun’t let no runaway
      niggers get bi me if I can help it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay went off and I got abord th raft, feeling bad and lo, becauz I
      knowed verry wel I had dun rong, and I see it worn’t no ues for me
      to tri to lern to do riet; a body that don’t get <i>started</i>
      riet when he’s litl ain’t got no sho—when th pinch
      cums thair ain’t nuthing to bak him up and keep him to his werk,
      and so he gets beet. Then I thaut a minit, and sez to mieself,
      hoeld on; s’poez u’d a dun riet and giv Jim up, wuud u
      felt beter than whut u do now? No, sez I, I’d feel bad—I’d
      feel just th saem way I do now. Wel, then, sez I, whut’s
      th ues u lerning to do riet when it’s trublsum to do riet
      and ain’t no trubl to do rong, and th waejes is just th saem?
      I was stuk. I couldn’t anser that. So I rekond
      I wouldn’t bother no mor about it, but after this allways do
      whichever cum handyest at th tiem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went into th wigwom; Jim worn’t thair. I luukt all around;
      he worn’t enywhair. I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Jim!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heer I is, Huck. Is day out o’ siet yit? Don’t
      tauk loud.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <a name="c16-127" id="c16-127"></a><br> <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in th river under th stern or, with just his noez out. I
      toeld him thay wer out of siet, so he cum abord. He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was a-listenin’ to all de tauk, en I slips into de river en
      was gwyne to shuv for sho’ if day cum abord. Den I was
      gwyne to swim to de raf’ agin when day was gon. But lawsy,
      how u did fool ’em, Huck! Dat <i>wuz</i> de smartes’ 
      doj! I tel u, chile, I’spec it saev’ oelay Jim—oelay
      Jim ain’t going to forgit u for dat, huny.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we taukt about th muny. It was a prity guud raez—twenty
      dolars apees. Jim sed we cuud taek dek pasej on a steemboet
      now, and th muny wuud last us as far as we wonted to go in th free
      Staets. He sed twenty miel mor worn’t far for th raft to go, but
      he wisht we was allredy thair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tords daybraek we tied up, and Jim was miety particuelar about hieding
      th raft guud. Then he werkt all day fixing things in bundls, and
      geting all redy to qit rafting.
    </p>
    <p>
      That niet about ten we hoev in siet of th liets of a toun away doun in
      a left-hand bend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went off in th canoo to ask about it. Prity soon I found a man
      out in th river with a skif, seting a trot-lien. I raenjd up and
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mister, is that toun Cairo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cairo? no. U must be a blaem’ fool.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut toun is it, mister?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If u wont to noe, go and fiend out. If u stay heer
      botherin’ around me for about a haf a minit longger u’ll
      get sumthing u wun’t wont.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I paddled to th raft. Jim was awful disapointed, but I sed never
      miend, Cairo wuud be th next plaes, I rekond.
    </p>
    <p>
      We past anuther toun befor dayliet, and I was going out agen; but it
      was hi ground, so I didn’t go. No hi ground about Cairo,
      Jim sed. I had forgot it. We laed up for th day on a toehed
      tolerabl cloez to th left-hand bank. I begun to suspishun
      sumthing. So did Jim. I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe we went bi Cairo in th fog that niet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doan’ le’s tauk about it, Huck. Po’ niggers
      can’t hav no luk. I awluz ’spected dat
      ratlsnaek-skin worn’t dun wid its werk.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wish I’d never seen that snaek-skin, Jim—I do wish I’d
      never laed ies on it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It ain’t yo’ fallt, Huck; u didn’ noe. Don’t
      u blaem yo’self ’bout it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was dayliet, heer was th cleer Ohio wauter inshor, shur enuf,
      and outsied was th oeld reguelar Mudy! So it was all up with Cairo.
    </p>
    <p>
      We taukt it all oever. It wouldn’t do to taek to th shor; we
      couldn’t taek th raft up th streem, of cors. Thair worn’t
      no way but to waet for dark, and start bak in th canoo and taek th
      chanses. So we slept all day amungst th cotonwuud thiket, so as
      to be fresh for th werk, and when we went bak to th raft about dark th
      canoo was gon!
    </p>
    <p>
      We didn’t say a werd for a guud whiel. Thair worn’t
      enything to say. We boeth knowed wel enuf it was sum mor werk of
      th ratlsnaek-skin; so whut was th ues to tauk about it? It wuud
      oenly luuk liek we was fiending fallt, and that wuud be bound to fech mor
      bad luk—and keep on feching it, too, til we knowed enuf to keep
      stil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bi and bi we taukt about whut we beter do, and found thair worn’t
      no way but just to go along doun with th raft til we got a chans to bi
      a canoo to go bak in. We worn’t going to borro it when thair
      worn’t enybody around, th way pap wuud do, for that miet set
      peepl after us.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we shuvd out after dark on th raft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enybody that don’t beleev yet that it’s foolishnes to handl
      a snaek-skin, after all that that snaek-skin dun for us, wil beleev it
      now if thay red on and see whut mor it dun for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th plaes to bi canoos is off of rafts laying up at shor. But we
      didn’t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three ours
      and mor. Wel, th niet got gray and ruther thik, which is th
      next meenest thing to fog. U can’t tel th shaep of th
      river, and u can’t see no distans. It got to be verry laet and
      stil, and then along cums a steemboet up th river. We lit th
      lantern, and jujd she wuud see it. Up-streem boets didn’t
      generly cum cloez to us; thay go out and folo th bars and hunt for
      eezy wauter under th reefs; but niets liek this thay buul riet up th
      chanel agenst th hoel river.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cuud heer her pounding along, but we didn’t see her guud til
      she was cloez. She aemd riet for us. Offen thay do that and
      tri to see how cloez thay can cum without tuching; sumtiems th wheel
      biets off a sweep, and then th pielot stiks his hed out and lafs, and
      thinks he’s miety smart. Wel, heer she cums, and we sed
      she was going to tri and shaev us; but she didn’t seem to be
      sheering off a bit. She was a big wun, and she was cuming in a
      hery, too, luuking liek a blak cloud with roes of glo-werms around it;
      but all of a suden she buljd out, big and scairy, with a long ro of
      wied-oepen fernis dors shiening liek red-hot teeth, and her monstrus boes
      and gards hanging riet oever us. Thair was a yel at us, and a
      jinggling of bels to stop th enjins, a powwow of cussing, and whisling
      of steem—and as Jim went oeverbord on wun sied and I on th uther,
      she cum smashing straet thru th raft.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dievd—and I aemd to fiend th botom, too, for a therty-fuut wheel
      had got to go oever me, and I wonted it to hav plenty of room. I
      cuud allways stay under wauter a minit; this tiem I rekon I stayd under
      a minit and a haf. Then I bounst for th top in a hery, for I
      was neerly busting. I popt out to mi armpits and blowed th wauter
      out of mi noez, and puft a bit. Of cors thair was a booming
      curent; and of cors that boet started her enjins agen ten seconds
      after she stopt them, for thay never caird much for raftsmen; so now she
      was cherning along up th river, out of siet in th thik wether, tho
      I cuud heer her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sung out for Jim about a duzen tiems, but I didn’t get eny anser;
      so I grabd a plank that tucht me whiel I was “treding wauter,”
      and struk out for shor, shuving it ahed of me. But I maed out to
      see that th drift of th curent was tords th left-hand shor, which
      ment that I was in a crossing; so I chaenjd off and went that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was wun of thees long, slanting, too-miel crossings; so I was a guud
      long tiem in geting oever. I maed a saef landing, and clumb up th
      bank. I couldn’t see but a litl ways, but I went poeking along oever
      ruf ground for a qorter of a miel or mor, and then I run across a big
      oeld-fashund dubl log-hous befor I noetist it. I was going to
      rush bi and get away, but a lot of daugs jumpt out and went to houling and
      barking at me, and I knowed beter than to moov anuther peg.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XVII.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about a minit sumbody spoek out of a windo without puuting his hed
      out, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be dun, boys! Hoo’s thair?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoo’s me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “George Jackson, ser.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut do u wont?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t wont nuthing, ser. I oenly wont to go along bi,
      but th daugs wun’t let me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut ar u prouling around heer this tiem of niet for—hay?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I worn’t prouling around, ser, I fel oeverbord off of th
      steemboet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, u did, did u? Striek a liet thair, sumbody. Whut
      did u say yur naem was?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “George Jackson, ser. I’m oenly a boy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Luuk heer, if u’re teling th trooth u needn’t be
      afraed—noebody’ll hert u. But don’t tri to buj;
      stand riet whair u ar. Rouz out Bob and Tom, sum of u, and
      fech th guns. George Jackson, is thair enybody with u?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, ser, noebody.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I herd th peepl stering around in th hous now, and see a liet. Th
      man sung out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Snach that liet away, Betsy, u oeld fool—ain’t u
      got eny sens? Puut it on th flor behiend th frunt dor. Bob, if
      u and Tom ar redy, taek yur plaeses.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All redy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, George Jackson, do u noe th Shepherdsons?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, ser; I never herd of them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, that may be so, and it mayn’t. Now, all redy.
      Step forward, George Jackson. And miend, don’t u hery—cum
      miety slo. If thair’s enybody with u, let him keep bak—if
      he shoes himself he’ll be shot. Cum along now. Cum slo;
      puush th dor oepen yurself—just enuf to sqeez in, d’ u
      heer?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t hery; I couldn’t if I’d a wonted to. I
      tuuk wun slo step at a tiem and thair worn’t a sound, oenly I
      thaut I cuud heer mi hart. Th daugs wer as stil as th huemans,
      but thay foloed a litl behiend me. When I got to th three log
      doorsteps I herd them unloking and unbarring and unbolting. I puut
      mi hand on th dor and puusht it a litl and a litl mor til sumbody
      sed, “Thair, that’s enuf—puut yur hed in.” I
      dun it, but I jujd thay wuud taek it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th candl was on th flor, and thair thay all was, luuking at me, and me
      at them, for about a qorter of a minit: Three big men with guns
      pointed at me, which maed me wince, I tel u; th oeldest, gray and about
      sixty, th uther too therty or mor—all of them fien and hansum—and
      th sweetest oeld gray-heded laedy, and bak of her too yung wimen which I
      couldn’t see riet wel. Th oeld jentlman sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thair; I rekon it’s all riet. Cum in.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I was in th oeld jentlman he lokt th dor and bard it and
      boelted it, and toeld th yung men to cum in with thair guns, and thay all
      went in a big parlor that had a nue rag carpet on th flor, and got
      together in a corner that was out of th raenj of th frunt windoes—thair
      worn’t nun on th sied. Thay held th candl, and tuuk a guud
      luuk at me, and all sed, “Whi, <i>he</i> ain’t a Shepherdson—no,
      thair ain’t eny Shepherdson about him.” Then th oeld man
      sed he hoept I wouldn’t miend being sercht for arms, becauz he
      didn’t meen no harm bi it—it was oenly to maek shur. So
      he didn’t pri into mi pokets, but oenly felt outsied with his hands,
      and sed it was all riet. He toeld me to maek mieself eezy and at
      hoem, and tel all about mieself; but th oeld laedy sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, bles u, Saul, th pur thing’s as wet as he can be;
      and don’t u rekon it may be he’s hunggry?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Troo for u, Rachel—I forgot.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So th oeld laedy sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Betsy” (this was a nigger wuuman), “u fli around and
      get him sumthing to eet as qik as u can, pur thing; and wun of u
      gerls go and waek up Buk and tel him—o, heer he is himself.
      Buk, taek this litl straenjer and get th wet cloeths off frum him
      and dres him up in sum of yurs that’s dri.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Buk luukt about as oeld as me—therteen or forteen or along thair,
      tho he was a litl biger than me. He hadn’t on enything
      but a shert, and he was verry frouzy-heded. He caem in gaeping and
      diging wun fist into his ies, and he was draging a gun along with th
      uther wun. He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <a name="c17-134" id="c17-134"></a><br> <br>
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ain’t thay no Shepherdsons around?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay sed, no, ’twas a falls alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” he sez, “if thay’d a ben sum, I rekon I’d
      a got wun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay all laft, and Bob sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Buk, thay miet hav scalped us all, u’ve bin so
      slo in cuming.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, noebody cum after me, and it ain’t riet I’m
      allways kept doun; I don’t get no sho.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never miend, Buk, mi boy,” sez th oeld man, “u’ll
      hav sho enuf, all in guud tiem, don’t u fret about that.
      Go ’long with u now, and do as yur muther toeld u.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a cors shert and a
      roundabout and pants of his, and I puut them on. Whiel I was at it he
      askt me whut mi naem was, but befor I cuud tel him he started to tel
      me about a bluejay and a yung rabit he had catched in th wuuds day
      befor yesterday, and he askt me whair Moses was when th candl went
      out. I sed I didn’t noe; I hadn’t herd about it
      befor, no way.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, ges,” he sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How’m I going to ges,” sez I, “when I never
      herd tel of it befor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But u can ges, can’t u? It’s just as eezy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Which</i> candl?” I sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, eny candl,” he sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t noe whair he was,” sez I; “whair was
      he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, he was in th <i>dark</i>! That’s whair he was!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, if u knowed whair he was, whut did u ask me for?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, blaem it, it’s a ridl, don’t u see? Say,
      how long ar u going to stay heer? U got to stay allways. We
      can just hav booming tiems—thay don’t hav no scool now.
      Do u oen a daug? I’ve got a daug—and he’ll
      go in th river and bring out chips that u thro in. Do u liek
      to coem up Sundays, and all that kiend of foolishnes? U bet I don’t,
      but maa she maeks me. Confound thees oelay briches! I rekon I’d
      beter puut ’em on, but I’d ruther not, it’s so worm.
      Ar u all redy? All riet. Cum along, oeld hoss.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Coeld corn-pone, coeld corn-beef, buter and butermilk—that is whut
      thay had for me doun thair, and thair ain’t nuthing beter that ever
      I’ve cum across yet. Buk and his maa and all of them smoekt
      cob pieps, exsept th nigger wuuman, which was gon, and th too yung
      wimen. Thay all smoekt and taukt, and I eet and taukt. Th
      yung wimen had qilts around them, and thair hair doun thair baks.
      Thay all askt me qeschuns, and I toeld them how pap and me and all
      th family was living on a litl farm doun at th botom of Arkansaw, and
      mi sister Mary Ann run off and got marryd and never was herd of no mor,
      and Bil went to hunt them and he worn’t herd of no mor, and Tom
      and Mort died, and then thair worn’t noebody but just me and pap
      left, and he was just trimd doun to nuthing, on acount of his trubls;
      so when he died I tuuk whut thair was left, becauz th farm didn’t
      belong to us, and started up th river, dek pasej, and fel oeverbord;
      and that was how I cum to be heer. So thay sed I cuud hav a hoem
      thair as long as I wonted it. Then it was moest dayliet and
      evrybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buk, and when I waekt up in
      th morning, drat it all, I had forgot whut mi naem was. So I laed thair
      about an our trieing to think, and when Buk waekt up I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can u spel, Buk?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” he sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I bet u can’t spel mi naem,” sez I.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I bet u whut u dair I can,” sez he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet,” sez I, “go ahed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n—thair now,” he sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” sez I, “u dun it, but I didn’t think
      u cuud. It ain’t no slouch of a naem to spel—riet
      off without studying.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I set it doun, prievet, becauz sumbody miet wont <i>me</i> to spel it
      next, and so I wonted to be handy with it and ratl it off liek I was
      uezd to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a miety nies family, and a miety nies hous, too. I hadn’t
      seen no hous out in th cuntry befor that was so nies and had so much
      stiel. It didn’t hav an ieern lach on th frunt dor, nor a
      wuuden wun with a bukskin string, but a bras nob to tern, th saem as
      houses in toun. Thair worn’t no bed in th parlor, nor a sien of a
      bed; but heeps of parlors in touns has beds in them. Thair was a big
      fierplaes that was bricked on th botom, and th briks was kept cleen
      and red bi poring wauter on them and scrubing them with anuther brik;
      sumtiems thay wosh them oever with red wauter-paent that thay call
      Spanish-broun, saem as thay do in toun. Thay had big bras daug-ieerns
      that cuud hoeld up a saw-log. Thair was a clok on th midl of th
      mantelpees, with a pikcher of a toun paented on th botom haf of th
      glas frunt, and a round plaes in th midl of it for th sun, and u
      cuud see th penjulum swinging behiend it. It was buetiful to heer
      that clok tik; and sumtiems when wun of thees pedlers had bin along
      and scourd her up and got her in guud shaep, she wuud start in and
      striek a hundred and fifty befor she got tuckered out. Thay wouldn’t
      tuuk eny muny for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, thair was a big outlandish parrot on eech sied of th clok, maed
      out of sumthing liek chauk, and paented up gaudy. Bi wun of th
      parrots was a cat maed of crokery, and a crokery daug bi th uther; and
      when u prest doun on them thay sqeekt, but didn’t oepen thair
      mouths nor luuk diferent nor interested. Thay sqeekt thru
      underneeth. Thair was a cupl of big wield-terky-wing fans spred
      out behiend thoes things. On th taebl in th midl of th room was
      a kiend of a luvly crokery basket that had apls and orenjes and peeches
      and graeps pield up in it, which was much reder and yellower and prityer
      than reeal wuns is, but thay worn’t reeal becauz u cuud see whair
      peeses had got chipt off and shoed th whiet chauk, or whutever it was,
      underneeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      This taebl had a cuver maed out of buetiful oilclauth, with a red and bloo
      spred-eegl paented on it, and a paented border all around. It cum
      all th way frum Philadelphia, thay sed. Thair was sum buuks, too,
      pield up perfectly exact, on eech corner of th taebl. Wun was a big
      family Biebl fuul of pikchers. Wun was Pilgrim’s Progres,
      about a man that left his family, it didn’t say whi. I red
      considerabl in it now and then. Th staetments was interesting, but
      tuf. Anuther was Frendship’s Offering, fuul of buetiful
      stuf and poeetry; but I didn’t red th poeetry. Anuther was
      Henry Clay’s Speeches, and anuther was Dr. Gunn’s Family
      Medisin, which toeld u all about whut to do if a body was sik or ded.
      Thair was a him buuk, and a lot of uther buuks. And thair was
      nies split-botom chairs, and perfectly sound, too—not bagd doun
      in th midl and busted, liek an oeld basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay had pikchers hung on th walls—maenly Washingtons and
      Lafayettes, and batls, and Hieland Marys, and wun calld “Siening
      th Declaraeshun.” Thair was sum that thay calld crayons, which wun
      of th dauters which was ded maed her oen self when she was oenly
      fifteen yeers oeld. Thay was diferent frum eny pikchers I ever see
      befor—blacker, moestly, than is comon. Wun was a wuuman in a
      slim blak dres, belted small under th armpits, with bulges liek a
      cabej in th midl of th sleevs, and a larj blak scoop-shuvel
      bonet with a blak vael, and whiet slim ankls crosst about with blak
      taep, and verry wee blak slipers, liek a chizel, and she was leening
      pensiv on a toomstoen on her riet elbo, under a weeping wilo, and her
      uther hand hanging doun her sied hoelding a whiet hankerchif and a reticuel,
      and underneeth th pikcher it sed “Shal I Never See Thee Mor
      Alas.” Anuther wun was a yung laedy with her hair all coemd
      up straet to th top of her hed, and noted thair in frunt of a coem
      liek a chair-bak, and she was crieing into a hankerchif and had a ded
      berd laying on its bak in her uther hand with its heels up, and
      underneeth th pikcher it sed “I Shal Never Heer Thi Sweet Chirrup
      Mor Alas.” Thair was wun whair a yung laedy was at a windo
      luuking up at th moon, and teers runing doun her cheeks; and she had an
      oepen leter in wun hand with blak seeling wax shoeing on wun ej of it,
      and she was mashing a locket with a chaen to it agenst her mouth, and
      underneeth th pikcher it sed “And Art Thow Gon Yes Thow Art Gon
      Alas.” Thees was all nies pikchers, I rekon, but I didn’t
      sumhow seem to taek to them, becauz if ever I was doun a litl thay
      allways giv me th fan-tods. Evrybody was sorry she died, becauz
      she had laed out a lot mor of thees pikchers to do, and a body cuud see
      bi whut she had dun whut thay had lost. But I rekond that with
      her dispozishun she was having a beter tiem in th graev-yard. She
      was at werk on whut thay sed was her graetest pikcher when she tuuk sik,
      and evry day and evry niet it was her prair to be alowd to liv til
      she got it dun, but she never got th chans. It was a pikcher of a
      yung wuuman in a long whiet goun, standing on th rael of a brij all
      redy to jump off, with her hair all doun her bak, and luuking up to th
      moon, with th teers runing doun her faes, and she had too arms foelded
      across her brest, and too arms strecht out in frunt, and too mor
      reeching up tords th moon—and th iedeea was to see which pair
      wuud luuk best, and then scrach out all th uther arms; but, as I was
      saying, she died befor she got her miend maed up, and now thay kept this
      pikcher oever th hed of th bed in her room, and evry tiem her berthday
      cum thay hung flowers on it. Uther tiems it was hid with a litl
      curten. Th yung wuuman in th pikcher had a kiend of a nies sweet
      faes, but thair was so meny arms it maed her luuk too spiedery, seemd to
      me.

      If Emmeline Grangerford cuud maek poeetry liek that befor she was
      forteen, thair ain’t no teling whut she cuud a dun bi and bi.
      Buk sed she cuud ratl off poeetry liek nuthing. She didn’t
      ever hav to stop to think. He sed she wuud slap doun a lien, and
      if she couldn’t fiend enything to riem with it wuud just scrach it
      out and slap doun anuther wun, and go ahed. She worn’t particuelar;
      she cuud riet about enything u chooz to giv her to riet about just
      so it was sadful. Evry tiem a man died, or a wuuman died, or a chield died,
      she wuud be on hand with her “tribuet” befor he was coeld.
      She calld them tribuets. Th naebors sed it was th doctor
      ferst, then Emmeline, then th undertaeker—th undertaeker never got
      in ahed of Emmeline but wuns, and then she hung fier on a riem for th
      ded person’s naem, which was Whistler. She worn’t ever
      th saem after that; she never complaend, but she kiender pined away and
      did not liv long. Pur thing, meny’s th tiem I maed mieself
      go up to th litl room that uezd to be hers and get out her pur oeld
      scrap-buuk and red in it when her pikchers had bin agravaeting me and I
      had soured on her a litl. I liekt all that family, ded wuns and
      all, and worn’t going to let enything cum between us. Pur
      Emmeline maed poeetry about all th ded peepl when she was aliev, and it
      didn’t seem riet that thair worn’t noebody to maek sum about
      her now she was gon; so I tried to swet out a vers or too mieself, but I
      couldn’t seem to maek it go sumhow. Thay kept Emmeline’s
      room trim and nies, and all th things fixt in it just th way she liekt
      to hav them when she was aliev, and noebody ever slept thair. Th
      oeld laedy tuuk cair of th room herself, tho thair was plenty of
      niggers, and she soed thair a guud deel and red her Biebl thair moestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, as I was saying about th parlor, thair was buetiful curtens on
      th windoes: whiet, with pikchers paented on them of casls with
      viens all doun th walls, and catl cuming doun to drink. Thair was
      a litl oeld peano, too, that had tin pans in it, I rekon, and nuthing
      was ever so luvly as to heer th yung laedys sing “Th Last Link
      is Broeken” and play “Th Batl of Prague” on it. Th
      walls of all th rooms was plasterd, and moest had carpets on th flors,
      and th hoel hous was whietwosht on th outsied.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dubl hous, and th big oepen plaes betwixt them was rooft and
      floored, and sumtiems th taebl was set thair in th midl of th day,
      and it was a cool, cumfortabl plaes. Nuthing couldn’t be
      beter. And worn’t th cuuking guud, and just buushels of it
      too!

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XVIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Grangerford was a jentlman, u see. He was a jentlman
      all oever; and so was his family. He was wel born, as th saying is,
      and that’s werth as much in a man as it is in a hors, so th Wido
      Douglas sed, and noebody ever denied that she was of th ferst arristocrasy
      in our toun; and pap he allways sed it, too, tho he worn’t no
      mor qolity than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was verry
      tall and verry slim, and had a darkish-paly complexshun, not a sien of red
      in it anywheres; he was cleen shaevd evry morning all oever his thin faes,
      and he had th thinnest kiend of lips, and th thinnest kiend of nostrils,
      and a hi noez, and hevy iebrows, and th blakest kiend of ies, sunk
      so deep bak that thay seemd liek thay was luuking out of caverns at u,
      as u may say. His forhed was hi, and his hair was blak and
      straet and hung to his shoelders. His hands was long and thin, and evry
      day of his lief he puut on a cleen shert and a fuul soot frum hed to fuut
      maed out of linen so whiet it hert yur ies to luuk at it; and on Sundays
      he wor a bloo tael-coet with bras butons on it. He carryd a
      mahogany caen with a silver hed to it. Thair worn’t no
      frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he worn’t ever loud. He
      was as kiend as he cuud be—u cuud feel that, u noe, and so u
      had confidens. Sumtiems he smield, and it was guud to see; but
      when he straetend himself up liek a liberty-poel, and th lietning
      begun to fliker out frum under his iebrows, u wonted to cliem a tree
      ferst, and fiend out whut th mater was afterwards. He didn’t
      ever hav to tel enybody to miend thair maners—evrybody was allways
      guud-manerd whair he was. Evrybody luvd to hav him around, too;
      he was sunshien moest allways—I meen he maed it seem liek guud
      wether. When he ternd into a cloudbank it was awful dark for haf
      a minit, and that was enuf; thair wouldn’t nuthing go rong agen
      for a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      When him and th oeld laedy cum doun in th morning all th family got up
      out of thair chairs and giv them guud-day, and didn’t set doun
      agen til thay had set doun. Then Tom and Bob went to th siedbord
      whair th decanter was, and mixt a glas of biters and handed it to him,
      and he held it in his hand and waeted til Tom’s and Bob’s was
      mixt, and then thay boed and sed, “Our duety to u, ser, and
      madam;” and <i>thay</i> boed th leest bit in th werld and sed
      thank u, and so thay drank, all three, and Bob and Tom pord a spoonful
      of wauter on th shuugar and th miet of whisky or apl brandy in th botom
      of thair tumblers, and giv it to me and Buk, and we drank to th oeld
      peepl too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob was th oeldest and Tom next—tall, buetiful men with verry braud
      shoelders and broun faeses, and long blak hair and blak ies. Thay
      drest in whiet linen frum hed to fuut, liek th oeld jentlman, and wor
      braud Panama hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then thair was Mis Charlotte; she was twenty-fiev, and tall and proud and
      grand, but as guud as she cuud be when she worn’t sterd up; but
      when she was she had a luuk that wuud maek u wilt in yur traks, liek
      her faather. She was buetiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      So was her sister, Mis Sophia, but it was a diferent kiend. She was
      jentl and sweet liek a doev, and she was oenly twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eech person had thair oen nigger to waet on them—Buk too. Mi
      nigger had a monstrus eezy tiem, becauz I worn’t uezd to having
      enybody do enything for me, but Buk’s was on th jump moest of th
      tiem.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all thair was of th family now, but thair uezd to be mor—three
      suns; thay got kild; and Emmeline that died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th oeld jentlman oend a lot of farms and oever a hundred niggers.
      Sumtiems a stak of peepl wuud cum thair, horsbak, frum ten or
      fifteen miel around, and stay fiev or six days, and hav such junketings
      round about and on th river, and danses and picniks in th wuuds
      daytimes, and balls at th hous niets. Thees peepl was moestly
      kinfolks of th family. Th men braut thair guns with them. It
      was a hansum lot of qolity, I tel u.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thair was anuther clan of arristocrasy around thair—fiev or six
      familys—moestly of th naem of Shepherdson. Thay was as
      hi-toned and wel born and rich and grand as th trieb of Grangerfords.
      Th Shepherdsons and Grangerfords uezd th saem steemboet landing,
      which was about too miel abuv our hous; so sumtiems when I went up
      thair with a lot of our foeks I uezd to see a lot of th Shepherdsons
      thair on thair fien horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wun day Buk and me was away out in th wuuds hunting, and herd a hors
      cuming. We was crossing th roed. Buk sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Qik! Jump for th wuuds!”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c18-145" id="c18-145"></a><br> <br>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c18-145.jpg (70K)" src="./HuckFinn_files/c18-145.jpg" style="width:100%;"><br>
    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      We dun it, and then peeped doun th wuuds thru th leevs. Prity
      soon a splendid yung man cum galoping doun th roed, seting his hors
      eezy and luuking liek a soeljer. He had his gun across his pumel.
      I had seen him befor. It was yung Harney Shepherdson. I
      herd Buk’s gun go off at mi eer, and Harney’s hat tumbld
      off frum his hed. He grabd his gun and roed straet to th plaes
      whair we was hid. But we didn’t waet. We started thru
      th wuuds on a run. Th wuuds worn’t thik, so I luukt oever
      mi shoelder to doj th buulet, and twies I seen Harney cuver Buk with
      his gun; and then he roed away th way he cum—to get his hat, I
      rekon, but I couldn’t see. We never stopt runing til we
      got hoem. Th oeld jentlman’s ies blaezd a minit—’twas
      plezher, maenly, I jujd—then his faes sort of smoothd doun, and
      he sez, kiend of jentl:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t liek that shooting frum behiend a buush. Whi didn’t
      u step into th roed, mi boy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th Shepherdsons don’t, faather. Thay allways taek
      advantej.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mis Charlotte she held her hed up liek a qeen whiel Buk was teling
      his tael, and her nostrils spred and her ies snapt. Th too
      yung men luukt dark, but never sed nuthing. Mis Sophia she
      ternd pael, but th culor cum bak when she found th man worn’t
      hert.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c18-146" id="c18-146"></a><br> <br>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon as I cuud get Buk doun bi th corn-cribs under th trees bi
      ourselvs, I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did u wont to kil him, Buk?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I bet I did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut did he do to u?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Him? He never dun nuthing to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, whut did u wont to kil him for?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, nuthing—oenly it’s on acount of th fued.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut’s a fued?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, whair was u raezd? Don’t u noe whut a fued
      is?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never herd of it befor—tel me about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” sez Buk, “a fued is this way: A man has
      a qorrel with anuther man, and kils him; then that uther man’s
      bruther kils <i>him</i>; then th uther bruthers, on boeth sieds, goes for
      wun anuther; then th <i>cuzins</i> chip in—and bi and bi evrybody’s
      kild off, and thair ain’t no mor fued. But it’s kiend
      of slo, and taeks a long tiem.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has this wun bin going on long, Buk?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I shuud <i>rekon</i>! It started therty yeer ago, or
      som’ers along thair. Thair was trubl ’bout sumthing,
      and then a lawsoot to setl it; and th soot went agin wun of th men,
      and so he up and shot th man that wun th soot—which he wuud
      nacheraly do, of cors. Enybody wuud.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut was th trubl about, Buk?—land?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I rekon maybe—I don’t noe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, hoo dun th shooting? Was it a Grangerford or a
      Shepherdson?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Laws, how do I noe? It was so long ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t enybody noe?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, yes, paa noes, I rekon, and sum of th uther oeld peepl; but
      thay don’t noe now whut th ro was about in th ferst plaes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has thair bin meny kild, Buk?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; riet smart chans of fuenerals. But thay don’t
      allways kil. Paa’s got a fue bukshot in him; but he don’t
      miend it ’cuz he don’t way much, enyway. Bob’s
      bin carvd up sum with a bowie, and Tom’s bin hert wuns or twies.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has enybody bin kild this yeer, Buk?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; we got wun and thay got wun. ’Bout three munths
      ago mi cuzin Bud, forteen yeer oeld, was rieding thru th wuuds on t’uther
      sied of th river, and didn’t hav no wepon with him, which was
      blaem’ foolishnes, and in a loensum plaes he heers a hors
      a-cuming behiend him, and sees oeld Balldy Shepherdson a-linkin’ after
      him with his gun in his hand and his whiet hair a-flieing in th wiend; and
      ’sted of jumping off and taeking to th brush, Bud ’lowed he
      cuud out-run him; so thay had it, nip and tuk, for fiev miel or mor,
      th oeld man a-gaening all th tiem; so at last Bud seen it worn’t
      eny ues, so he stopt and faest around so as to hav th buulet hoels in
      frunt, u noe, and th oeld man he roed up and shot him doun. But
      he didn’t git much chans to enjoy his luk, for insied of a week
      our foeks laed <i>him</i> out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I rekon that oeld man was a coward, Buk.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I rekon he <i>worn’t</i> a coward. Not bi a blaem’ 
      siet. Thair ain’t a coward amungst them Shepherdsons—not
      a wun. And thair ain’t no cowards amungst th Grangerfords
      eether. Whi, that oeld man kep’ up his end in a fiet wun day
      for haf an our agenst three Grangerfords, and cum out winer. Thay
      was all a-horsbak; he lit off of his hors and got behiend a litl
      wuudpiel, and kep’ his hors befor him to stop th buulets; but th
      Grangerfords stayd on thair horses and capered around th oeld man, and
      peperd away at him, and he peperd away at them. Him and his
      hors boeth went hoem prity leeky and cripld, but th Grangerfords had
      to be <i>fetched</i> hoem—and wun of ’em was ded, and anuther
      died th next day. No, ser; if a body’s out hunting for
      cowards he don’t wont to fool away eny tiem amungst them
      Shepherdsons, becuz thay don’t breed eny of that <i>kiend</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Next Sunday we all went to cherch, about three miel, evrybody
      a-horsbak. Th men tuuk thair guns along, so did Buk, and kept them
      between thair nees or stuud them handy agenst th wall. Th
      Shepherdsons dun th saem. It was prity ornery preeching—all
      about brutherly luv, and such-liek tiresomeness; but evrybody sed it
      was a guud sermon, and thay all taukt it oever going hoem, and had such a
      powerful lot to say about faeth and guud werks and free graes and
      preforeordestination, and I don’t noe whut all, that it did seem to
      me to be wun of th rufest Sundays I had run across yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      About an our after diner evrybody was doezing around, sum in thair
      chairs and sum in thair rooms, and it got to be prity dul. Buk
      and a daug was strecht out on th gras in th sun sound asleep. I
      went up to our room, and jujd I wuud taek a nap mieself. I found
      that sweet Mis Sophia standing in her dor, which was next to ours, and
      she tuuk me in her room and shut th dor verry sofft, and askt me if I
      liekt her, and I sed I did; and she askt me if I wuud do sumthing for
      her and not tel enybody, and I sed I wuud. Then she sed she’d
      forgot her Testament, and left it in th seet at cherch between too uther
      buuks, and wuud I slip out qieet and go thair and fech it to her, and
      not say nuthing to noebody. I sed I wuud. So I slid out and slipt
      off up th roed, and thair worn’t enybody at th cherch, exsept
      maybe a hog or too, for thair worn’t eny lok on th dor, and hogs
      lieks a punchon flor in sumer-tiem becauz it’s cool. If
      u noetis, moest foeks don’t go to cherch oenly when thay’ve
      got to; but a hog is diferent.

      Sez I to mieself, sumthing’s up; it ain’t nacheral for a gerl
      to be in such a swet about a Testament. So I giv it a shaek, and
      out drops a litl pees of paeper with “Haf-PAST Too” roet
      on it with a pensil. I ransakt it, but couldn’t fiend
      enything els. I couldn’t maek enything out of that, so I puut
      th paeper in th buuk agen, and when I got hoem and upstairs thair was
      Mis Sophia in her dor waeting for me. She puuld me in and shut
      th dor; then she luukt in th Testament til she found th paeper, and
      as soon as she red it she luukt glad; and befor a body cuud think she
      grabd me and giv me a sqeez, and sed I was th best boy in th
      werld, and not to tel enybody. She was miety red in th faes for a
      minit, and her ies lieted up, and it maed her powerful prity. I
      was a guud deel astonisht, but when I got mi breth I askt her whut th
      paeper was about, and she askt me if I had red it, and I sed no, and she
      askt me if I cuud red rieting, and I toeld her “no, oenly
      cors-hand,” and then she sed th paeper worn’t enything but
      a buuk-mark to keep her plaes, and I miet go and play now.

    <p>
      I went off doun to th river, studying oever this thing, and prity soon I
      noetist that mi nigger was foloeing along behiend. When we was out
      of siet of th hous he luukt bak and around a second, and then cums
      a-runing, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mars Jawge, if u’ll cum doun into de swomp I’ll sho
      u a hoel stak o’ wauter-mocasins.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinks I, that’s miety cuerius; he sed that yesterday. He
      oughter noe a body don’t luv wauter-mocasins enuf to go around
      hunting for them. Whut is he up to, enyway? So I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet; trot ahed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I foloed a haf a miel; then he struk out oever th swomp, and waeded
      ankl deep as much as anuther haf-miel. We cum to a litl flat
      pees of land which was dri and verry thik with trees and buushes and
      viens, and he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “U shuv riet in dah jist a fue steps, Mars Jawge; dah’s
      whah day is. I’s seed ’m befo’; I don’t k’yer
      to see ’em no mo’.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he slopt riet along and went away, and prity soon th trees hid
      him. I poekt into th plaes a-ways and cum to a litl oepen pach
      as big as a bedroom all hung around with viens, and found a man laying
      thair asleep—and, bi jings, it was mi oeld Jim!
    </p>
    <p>
      I waekt him up, and I rekond it was going to be a grand serpriez to him
      to see me agen, but it worn’t. He neerly cried he was so
      glad, but he worn’t serpriezd. Sed he swum along behiend me
      that niet, and herd me yel evry tiem, but dasn’t anser, becauz
      he didn’t wont noebody to pik <i>him</i> up and taek him into
      slaevery agen. Sez he:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I got hert a litl, en couldn’t swim fas’, so I wuz a
      considable ways behine u tords de las’; when u landed I reck’ned
      I cuud ketch up wid u on de lan’ ’dout havin’ to
      shout at u, but when I see dat hous I begin to go slo. I ’uz
      off too fer to heer whut day say to u—I wuz ’fraid o’ 
      de daugs; but when it ’uz all qieet agin I knowed u’s in de
      hous, so I struk out for de wuuds to waet for day. Erly in de
      mawnin’ sum er de niggers cum along, gwyne to de feelds, en day
      tuk me en shoed me dis plaes, whah de daugs can’t trak me on
      acounts o’ de wauter, en day brings me truk to eet evry niet, en
      tels me how u’s a-gitt’n along.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi didn’t u tel mi Jak to fech me heer sooner, Jim?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, ’twarn’t no ues to ’sturb u, Huck, tel
      we cuud do sumfn—but we’s all riet now. I ben a-buyin’ 
      pots en pans en vittles, as I got a chanst, en a-patchin’ up de raf’ 
      niets when—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Whut</i> raft, Jim?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Our oelay raf’.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U meen to say our oeld raft worn’t smasht all to flinders?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, she worn’t. She was tore up a guud deel—wun
      en’ of her was; but day worn’t no graet harm dun, on’y
      our traps was mos’ all los’. Ef we hadn’ diev’ 
      so deep en swum so fer under wauter, en de niet hadn’ ben so dark,
      en we worn’t so sk’yerd, en ben sich punkin-heds, as de sayin’ 
      is, we’d a seed de raf’. But it’s jis’ as
      wel we didn’t, ’kase now she’s all fixt up agin mos’ 
      as guud as nue, en we’s got a nue lot o’ stuf, in de plaes o’ 
      whut ’uz los’.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, how did u get hoeld of th raft agen, Jim—did u
      cach her?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de wuuds? No; sum er de
      niggers foun’ her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben’, en
      day hid her in a crik ’mongst de wiloes, en day wuz so much jawin’ 
      ’bout which un ’um she b’long to de mos’ dat I
      cum to heah ’bout it pooty soon, so I ups en setls de trubl bi
      tellin’ ’um she don’t b’long to nun uv um, but to
      u en me; en I ast ’m if day gwyne to grab a yung whiet genlman’s

      me I doan’ hav to ast ’m twies, huny. Dat Jak’s
      a guud nigger, en pooty smart.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, he is. He ain’t ever toeld me u was heer; toeld me
      to cum, and he’d sho me a lot of wauter-mocasins. If
      enything hapens <i>he</i> ain’t mixt up in it. He can say he
      never seen us together, and it ’ll be th trooth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I don’t wont to tauk much about th next day. I rekon I’ll
      cut it prity short. I waekt up about daun, and was a-going to tern
      oever and go to sleep agen when I noetist how stil it was—didn’t
      seem to be enybody stering. That worn’t uezhual. Next I
      noetist that Buk was up and gon. Wel, I gets up, a-wundering, and goes
      doun stairs—noebody around; evrything as stil as a mous. Just
      th saem outsied. Thinks I, whut duz it meen? Doun bi th
      wuud-piel I cums across mi Jak, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut’s it all about?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Sez he:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t u noe, Mars Jawge?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” sez I, “I don’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, den, Mis Sophia’s run off! ’deed she has. She
      run off in de niet sum tiem—noebody don’t noe jis’ 
      when; run off to get marryd to dat yung Harney Shepherdson, u noe—leastways,
      so day ’spec. De fambly foun’ it out ’bout haf an

      de river roed for to tri to ketch dat yung man en kil him ’fo’ 
      he kin git acrost de river wid Mis Sophia. I reck’n day’s
      gwyne to be miety ruf tiems.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Buk went off ’thout waeking me up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I reck’n he <i>did</i>! Day worn’t gwyne to
      mix u up in it. Mars Buk he loeded up his gun en ’lowed he’s
      gwyne to fech hoem a Shepherdson or bust. Wel, day’ll be plenty un
      ’m dah, I reck’n, en u bet u he’ll fech wun ef he
      gits a chanst.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I tuuk up th river roed as hard as I cuud puut. Bi and bi I begin
      to heer guns a guud ways off. When I cum in siet of th log stor
      and th wuudpiel whair th steamboats lands I werkt along under th trees
      and brush til I got to a guud plaes, and then I clumb up into th forks
      of a cotonwuud that was out of reech, and wocht. Thair was a
      wuud-rank foer fuut hi a litl ways in frunt of th tree, and ferst I
      was going to hied behiend that; but maybe it was lukyer I didn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thair was foer or fiev men cavorting around on thair horses in th oepen
      plaes befor th log stor, cussing and yeling, and trieing to get at a
      cupl of yung chaps that was behiend th wuud-rank alongsied of th
      steemboet landing; but thay couldn’t cum it. Evry tiem wun
      of them shoed himself on th river sied of th wuudpiel he got shot at.
      Th too boys was sqoting bak to bak behiend th piel, so thay
      cuud woch boeth ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c18-153" id="c18-153"></a><br> <br>

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Bi and bi th men stopt cavorting around and yeling. Thay started
      rieding tords th stor; then up gets wun of th boys, draws a stedy
      beed oever th wuud-rank, and drops wun of them out of his sadl. All
      th men jumpt off of thair horses and grabd th hert wun and started to
      carry him to th stor; and that minit th too boys started on th run.
      Thay got haf way to th tree I was in befor th men noetist. Then
      th men see them, and jumpt on thair horses and tuuk out after them.
      Thay gaend on th boys, but it didn’t do no guud, th boys
      had too guud a start; thay got to th wuudpiel that was in frunt of mi
      tree, and slipt in behiend it, and so thay had th bulj on th men
      agen. Wun of th boys was Buk, and th uther was a slim yung chap about
      nienteen yeers oeld.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th men ript around awhiel, and then roed away. As soon as thay
      was out of siet I sung out to Buk and toeld him. He didn’t
      noe whut to maek of mi vois cuming out of th tree at ferst. He
      was awful serpriezd. He toeld me to woch out sharp and let him noe
      when th men cum in siet agen; sed thay was up to sum devilment or
      uther—wouldn’t be gon long. I wisht I was out of that
      tree, but I dasn’t cum doun. Buk begun to cri and rip, and
      ’lowed that him and his cuzin Joe (that was th uther yung chap)
      wuud maek up for this day yet. He sed his faather and his too
      bruthers was kild, and too or three of th enemy. Sed th
      Shepherdsons laed for them in ambush. Buk sed his faather and
      bruthers aut to waeted for thair relaeshuns—th Shepherdsons was
      too strong for them. I askt him whut was becum of yung Harney and
      Mis Sophia. He sed thay’d got across th river and was saef.
      I was glad of that; but th way Buk did taek on becauz he didn’t
      manej to kil Harney that day he shot at him—I hain’t ever
      herd enything liek it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of a suden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or foer guns—th men
      had slipt around thru th wuuds and cum in frum behiend without thair
      horses! Th boys jumpt for th river—boeth of them hert—and
      as thay swum doun th curent th men run along th bank shooting at them
      and singing out, “Kil them, kil them!” It maed me so
      sik I moest fel out of th tree. I ain’t a-going to tel <i>all</i>
      that hapend—it wuud maek me sik agen if I was to do that.
      I wisht I hadn’t ever cum ashor that niet to see such
      things. I ain’t ever going to get shut of them—lots of
      tiems I dreem about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stayd in th tree til it begun to get dark, afraed to cum doun.
      Sumtiems I herd guns away off in th wuuds; and twies I seen litl
      gangs of men galop past th log stor with guns; so I rekond th
      trubl was stil a-going on. I was miety dounharted; so I maed up
      mi miend I wouldn’t ever go anear that hous agen, becauz I
      rekond I was to blaem, sumhow. I jujd that that pees of paeper ment
      that Mis Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at haf-past too and run
      off; and I jujd I aut to toeld her faather about that paeper and th
      cuerius way she acted, and then maybe he wuud a lokt her up, and this
      awful mes wouldn’t ever hapend.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got doun out of th tree I crept along doun th river bank a pees,
      and found th too bodys laying in th ej of th wauter, and tugd at
      them til I got them ashor; then I cuverd up thair faeses, and got away
      as qik as I cuud. I cried a litl when I was cuvering up Buk’s
      faes, for he was miety guud to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just dark now. I never went neer th hous, but struk
      thru th wuuds and maed for th swomp. Jim worn’t on his
      ieland, so I trampt off in a hery for th crik, and crouded thru th
      wiloes, red-hot to jump abord and get out of that awful cuntry. Th
      raft was gon! Mi soels, but I was scaird! I couldn’t
      get mi breth for moest a minit. Then I raezd a yel. A vois not
      twenty-fiev fuut frum me sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guud lan’! is dat u, huny? Doan’ maek no
      noiz.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Jim’s vois—nuthing ever sounded so guud befor. I
      run along th bank a pees and got abord, and Jim he grabd me and
      hugd me, he was so glad to see me. He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Laws bles u, chile, I ’uz riet doun sho’ u’s
      ded agin. Jak’s bin heah; he say he reck’n u’s
      ben shot, kase u didn’ cum hoem no mo’; so I’s jes’ 
      dis minit a startin’ de raf’ doun tords de mouf er de
      crik, so’s to be all redy for to shuv out en leev soon as Jak
      cums agin en tels me for serten u <i>is</i> ded. Lawsy, I’s
      miety glad to git u bak agen, huny.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet—that’s miety guud; thay wun’t fiend me,
      and thay’ll think I’ve bin kild, and floeted doun th river—thair’s
      sumthing up thair that ’ll help them think so—so don’t
      u looz no tiem, Jim, but just shuv off for th big wauter as fast as
      ever u can.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I never felt eezy til th raft was too miel belo thair and out in th
      midl of th Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and
      jujd that we was free and saef wuns mor. I hadn’t had a
      biet to eet sinss yesterday, so Jim he got out sum corn-dojers and
      butermilk, and pork and cabej and greens—thair ain’t
      nuthing in th werld so guud when it’s cuukt riet—and whilst
      I eet mi super we taukt and had a guud tiem. I was powerful glad
      to get away frum th fueds, and so was Jim to get away frum th swomp.
      We sed thair worn’t no hoem liek a raft, after all. Uther
      plaeses do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don’t. U
      feel miety free and eezy and cumfortabl on a raft.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XIX.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too or three days and niets went bi; I rekon I miet say thay swum bi,
      thay slid along so qieet and smooth and luvly. Heer is th way we
      puut in th tiem. It was a monstrus big river doun thair—sumtiems
      a miel and a haf wied; we run niets, and laed up and hid daytimes; soon
      as niet was moest gon we stopt navigaeting and tied up—neerly
      allways in th ded wauter under a toehed; and then cut yung cottonwoods
      and wiloes, and hid th raft with them. Then we set out th liens.
      Next we slid into th river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and
      cool off; then we set doun on th sandy botom whair th wauter was about
      nee deep, and wocht th dayliet cum. Not a sound anywheres—perfectly
      stil—just liek th hoel werld was asleep, oenly sumtiems th
      bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe. Th ferst thing to see, luuking away
      oever th wauter, was a kiend of dul lien—that was th wuuds on t’uther
      sied; u couldn’t maek nuthing els out; then a pael plaes in th
      skie; then mor paelnes spreding around; then th river soffend up away
      off, and worn’t blak eny mor, but gray; u cuud see litl dark
      spots drifting along ever so far away—traeding scows, and such
      things; and long blak streeks—rafts; sumtiems u cuud heer a
      sweep screaking; or jumbld up voises, it was so stil, and sounds cum so
      far; and bi and bi u cuud see a streek on th wauter which u noe bi
      th luuk of th streek that thair’s a snag thair in a swift curent
      which braeks on it and maeks that streek luuk that way; and u see th
      mist curl up off of th wauter, and th eest reddens up, and th river, and
      u maek out a log-cabin in th ej of th wuuds, away on th bank on t’uther
      sied of th river, being a wuud-yard, liekly, and pield bi them cheats so
      u can thro a daug thru it anywheres; then th nies breez springs up,
      and cums faning u frum oever thair, so cool and fresh and sweet to
      smel on acount of th wuuds and th flowers; but sumtiems not that way,
      becauz thay’ve left ded fish laying around, gars and such, and
      thay do get prity rank; and next u’ve got th fuul day, and
      evrything smieling in th sun, and th song-berds just going it!
    </p>
    <p>
      A litl smoek couldn’t be noetist now, so we wuud taek sum fish
      off of th liens and cuuk up a hot brekfast. And afterwards we
      wuud woch th lonesomeness of th river, and kiend of laezy along, and bi
      and bi laezy off to sleep. Waek up bi and bi, and luuk to see whut
      dun it, and maybe see a steemboet caufing along up-streem, so far off
      tords th uther sied u couldn’t tel nuthing about her oenly
      whether she was a stern-wheel or sied-wheel; then for about an our thair
      wouldn’t be nuthing to heer nor nuthing to see—just solid
      lonesomeness. Next u’d see a raft slieding bi, away off
      yonder, and maybe a galoot on it choping, becauz thay’re moest
      allways doing it on a raft; u’d see th ax flash and cum doun—u
      don’t heer nuthing; u see that ax go up agen, and bi th tiem it’s
      abuv th man’s hed then u heer th <i>k’chunk</i>!—it
      had tuuk all that tiem to cum oever th wauter. So we wuud puut in
      th day, lazying around, lisening to th stilnes. Wuns thair was
      a thik fog, and th rafts and things that went bi was beeting tin pans so
      th steamboats wouldn’t run oever them. A scow or a raft went
      bi so cloez we cuud heer them tauking and cussing and lafing—herd
      them plaen; but we couldn’t see no sien of them; it maed u feel
      crawly; it was liek spirits carrying on that way in th air. Jim
      sed he beleevd it was spirits; but I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; spirits wouldn’t say, ‘Dern th dern fog.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon as it was niet out we shuvd; when we got her out to about th
      midl we let her aloen, and let her floet whairever th curent wonted her
      to; then we lit th pieps, and danggld our legs in th wauter, and taukt
      about all kiends of things—we was allways naeked, day and niet,
      whenever th moskeetoes wuud let us—th nue cloeths Buk’s
      foeks maed for me was too guud to be cumfortabl, and besieds I didn’t
      go much on cloeths, nohow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sumtiems we’d hav that hoel river all to ourselvs for th
      longgest tiem. Yonder was th banks and th ielands, across th wauter; and
      maybe a spark—which was a candl in a cabin windo; and sumtiems on
      th wauter u cuud see a spark or too—on a raft or a scow, u
      noe; and maybe u cuud heer a fidl or a song cuming oever frum wun of
      them crafts. It’s luvly to liv on a raft. We had th skie up
      thair, all spekld with stars, and we uezd to lay on our baks and luuk
      up at them, and discus about whether thay was maed or oenly just hapend.
      Jim he alowd thay was maed, but I alowd thay hapend; I jujd
      it wuud hav tuuk too long to <i>maek</i> so meny. Jim sed th
      moon cuud a <i>laed</i> them; wel, that luukt kiend of reezonabl, so I
      didn’t say nuthing agenst it, becauz I’ve seen a frog lay
      moest as meny, so of cors it cuud be dun. We uezd to woch th stars
      that fel, too, and see them streek doun. Jim alowd thay’d
      got spoild and was hoev out of th nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wuns or twies of a niet we wuud see a steemboet sliping along in th
      dark, and now and then she wuud belsh a hoel werld of sparks up out of
      her chimbleys, and thay wuud raen doun in th river and luuk awful
      prity; then she wuud tern a corner and her liets wuud wink out and her
      powwow shut off and leev th river stil agen; and bi and bi her waevs
      wuud get to us, a long tiem after she was gon, and jogl th raft a
      bit, and after that u wouldn’t heer nuthing for u couldn’t
      tel how long, exsept maybe frogs or sumthing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After midniet th peepl on shor went to bed, and then for too or three
      ours th shors was blak—no mor sparks in th cabin windoes.
      Thees sparks was our clok—th ferst wun that shoed agen
      ment morning was cuming, so we hunted a plaes to hied and tee up riet
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wun morning about daybraek I found a canoo and crosst oever a shoot to th
      maen shor—it was oenly too hundred yards—and paddled about a
      miel up a crik amungst th siepres wuuds, to see if I couldn’t get
      sum berrys. Just as I was pasing a plaes whair a kiend of a cowpath
      crosst th crik, heer cums a cupl of men tairing up th path as tiet
      as thay cuud fuut it. I thaut I was a goner, for whenever enybody
      was after enybody I jujd it was <i>me</i>—or maybe Jim. I
      was about to dig out frum thair in a hery, but thay was prity cloez to
      me then, and sung out and begd me to saev thair lievs—sed thay
      hadn’t bin doing nuthing, and was being chaest for it—sed
      thair was men and daugs a-cuming. Thay wonted to jump riet in, but I
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c19-160" id="c19-160"></a><br> <br>

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t u do it. I don’t heer th daugs and horses
      yet; u’ve got tiem to croud thru th brush and get up th crik
      a litl ways; then u taek to th wauter and waed doun to me and get in—that’ll
      thro th daugs off th sent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay dun it, and soon as thay was abord I lit out for our toehed, and
      in about fiev or ten minits we herd th daugs and th men away off,
      shouting. We herd them cum along tords th crik, but couldn’t
      see them; thay seemd to stop and fool around a whiel; then, as we got
      ferther and ferther away all th tiem, we couldn’t hardly heer them
      at all; bi th tiem we had left a miel of wuuds behiend us and struk th
      river, evrything was qieet, and we paddled oever to th toehed and hid in
      th cottonwoods and was saef.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wun of thees feloes was about seventy or upwards, and had a balld hed and
      verry gray whiskers. He had an oeld baterd-up slouch hat on, and a
      greezy bloo woollen shert, and raged oeld bloo jeens briches stuft into
      his boot-tops, and hoem-nit galluses—no, he oenly had wun. He
      had an oeld long-tailed bloo jeens coet with slik bras butons flung oever
      his arm, and boeth of them had big, fat, ratty-luuking carpet-bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th uther felo was about therty, and drest about as ornery. After
      brekfast we all laed off and taukt, and th ferst thing that cum out
      was that thees chaps didn’t noe wun anuther.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut got u into trubl?” sez th baldhead to t’uther
      chap.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I’d bin seling an articl to taek th tartar off th
      teeth—and it duz taek it off, too, and generly th enamel along
      with it—but I stayd about wun niet longger than I aut to, and was
      just in th act of slieding out when I ran across u on th trael this
      sied of toun, and u toeld me thay wer cuming, and begd me to help u
      to get off. So I toeld u I was expecting trubl mieself, and wuud
      scater out <i>with</i> u. That’s th hoel yarn—whut’s
      yourn?
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I’d ben a-runing’ a litl temperans revieval

    <p>
      “Oeld man,” sed th yung wun, “I rekon we miet
      dubl-teem it together; whut do u think?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I ain’t undisposed. Whut’s yur lien—maenly?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Jour printer bi traed; do a litl in patent medisins;

      “I’ve dun considerble in th doctoring way in mi tiem. Layin’

    </p>
    <p>
      Noebody never sed enything for a whiel; then th yung man hoev a si and
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut ’re u alassin’ about?” sez th balld-hed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To think I shuud hav livd to be leding such a lief, and be
      degraeded doun into such cumpany.” And he begun to wiep th
      corner of his ie with a rag.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dern yur skin, ain’t th cumpany guud enuf for u?”
      sez th baldhead, prity pert and uppish.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, it <i>is</i> guud enuf for me; it’s as guud as I
      dezerv; for hoo fetched me so lo when I was so hi? I did mieself.
      I don’t blaem <i>u</i>, jentlmen—far frum it; I don’t

      Sum day I’ll lie doun in it and forget it all, and mi pur broeken
      hart wil be at rest.” He went on a-wieping.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Drot yur por broeken hart,” sez th baldhead; “whut

    </p>
    <p>

      “Braut u doun frum whar? Whar was u braut doun frum?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Aa, u wuud not beleev me; th werld never beleevs—let it

    </p>
    <p>
      “Th seecret of yur berth! Do u meen to say—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Jentlmen,” sez th yung man, verry solem, “I wil
      reveel it to u, for I feel I may hav confidens in u. Bi riets
      I am a duek!”

    <p>
      Jim’s ies bugd out when he herd that; and I rekon mien did,
      too. Then th baldhead sez: “No! u can’t meen it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes. Mi graet-grandfaather, eldest sun of th Duek of
      Bridgewater, fled to this cuntry about th end of th last senchery, to
      breeth th puer air of freedom; marryd heer, and died, leeving a sun,
      his oen faather dieing about th saem tiem. Th second sun of th laet
      duek seezd th tietls and estaets—th infant reeal duek was ignord.
      I am th linial desendant of that infant—I am th rietful
      Duek of Bridgewater; and heer am I, forlorn, torn frum mi hi estaet,
      hunted of men, despiezd bi th coeld werld, raged, worn, hart-broeken, and
      degraeded to th companyonship of felons on a raft!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim pityd him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to cumfort him, but he
      sed it worn’t much ues, he couldn’t be much cumforted; sed
      if we was a miend to aknolej him, that wuud do him mor guud than moest
      enything els; so we sed we wuud, if he wuud tel us how. He sed
      we aut to bo when we spoek to him, and say “Yur Graes,” or
      “Mi Lord,” or “Yur Lordship”—and he wouldn’t
      miend it if we calld him plaen “Bridgewater,” which, he sed,
      was a tietl enyway, and not a naem; and wun of us aut to waet on him at
      diner, and do eny litl thing for him he wonted dun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, that was all eezy, so we dun it. All thru diner Jim stuud
      around and waeted on him, and sez, “Wil yo’ Graes hav sum
      o’ dis or sum o’ dat?” and so on, and a body cuud see
      it was miety pleezing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But th oeld man got prity sielent bi and bi—didn’t hav much
      to say, and didn’t luuk prity cumfortabl oever all that peting
      that was going on around that duek. He seemd to hav sumthing on
      his miend. So, along in th afternoon, he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Luuky heer, Bilgewater,” he sez, “I’m naeshun
      sorry for u, but u ain’t th oenly person that’s had
      trubls liek that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No u ain’t. U ain’t th oenly person that’s
      ben snaekt doun wrongfully out’n a hi plaes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, u ain’t th oenly person that’s had a seecret of
      his berth.” And, bi jings, <i>he</i> begins to cri.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoeld! Whut do u meen?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bilgewater, kin I trust u?” sez th oeld man, stil sort of
      sobing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To th biter deth!” He tuuk th oeld man bi th hand
      and sqeezd it, and sez, “That seecret of yur being: speek!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bilgewater, I am th laet Daufin!”

    <p>
      U bet u, Jim and me staird this tiem. Then th duek sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “U ar whut?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, mi frend, it is too troo—yur ies is lookin’ at

      of Looy th Sixteen and Marry Antonette.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U! At yur aej! No! U meen u’re th
      laet Charlemagne; u must be six or seven hundred yeers oeld, at th verry
      leest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Trubl has dun it, Bilgewater, trubl has dun it; trubl has
      brung thees gray hairs and this preematur balditude. Yes, jentlmen,
      u see befor u, in bloo jeens and mizery, th wanderin’, exield,
      trampld-on, and sufferin’ rietful King of France.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, he cried and tuuk on so that me and Jim didn’t noe hardly
      whut to do, we was so sorry—and so glad and proud we’d got him
      with us, too. So we set in, liek we dun befor with th duek, and
      tried to cumfort <i>him</i>. But he sed it worn’t no ues, nuthing
      but to be ded and dun with it all cuud do him eny guud; tho he sed
      it offen maed him feel eezyer and beter for a whiel if peepl treeted him
      acording to his riets, and got doun on wun nee to speek to him, and
      allways calld him “Yur Majesty,” and waeted on him ferst at
      meels, and didn’t set doun in his prezens til he askt them. So
      Jim and me set to majestying him, and doing this and that and t’uther
      for him, and standing up til he toeld us we miet set doun. This
      dun him heeps of guud, and so he got cheerful and cumfortabl. But
      th duek kiend of soured on him, and didn’t luuk a bit satisfied with
      th way things was going; stil, th king acted reeal frendly tords him,
      and sed th duek’s graet-grandfaather and all th uther Dueks of
      Bilgewater was a guud deel thaut of bi <i>his</i> faather, and was
      alowd to cum to th palas considerabl; but th duek stayd hufy a
      guud whiel, til bi and bi th king sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Liek as not we got to be together a blaemd long tiem on this h-yer
      raft, Bilgewater, and so whut’s th ues o’ yur bein’ 
      sour? It ’ll oenly maek things oncomfortable. It ain’t
      mi fallt I worn’t born a duek, it ain’t yur fallt u worn’t
      born a king—so whut’s th ues to wery? Maek th best o’ 
      things th way u fiend ’em, sez I—that’s mi moto.
      This ain’t no bad thing that we’ve struk heer—plenty
      grub and an eezy lief—cum, giv us yur hand, duek, and le’s
      all be frends.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th duek dun it, and Jim and me was prity glad to see it. It tuuk
      away all th uncomfortableness and we felt miety guud oever it, becauz it
      wuud a bin a mizerabl biznes to hav eny unfriendliness on th raft;
      for whut u wont, abuv all things, on a raft, is for evrybody to be
      satisfied, and feel riet and kiend tords th uthers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn’t taek me long to maek up mi miend that thees lieers worn’t
      no kings nor dueks at all, but just lo-doun humbugs and frauds. But
      I never sed nuthing, never let on; kept it to mieself; it’s th best
      way; then u don’t hav no qorrels, and don’t get into no
      trubl. If thay wonted us to call them kings and dueks, I hadn’t
      no objecshuns, ’long as it wuud keep pees in th family; and it
      worn’t no ues to tel Jim, so I didn’t tel him. If I
      never learnt nuthing els out of pap, I learnt that th best way to get
      along with his kiend of peepl is to let them hav thair oen way.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XX.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay askt us considerabl meny qeschuns; wonted to noe whut we cuverd
      up th raft that way for, and laed bi in th daytiem insted of runing—was
      Jim a runaway nigger? Sez I:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guudnes sakes! wuud a runaway nigger run <i>south</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      No, thay alowd he wouldn’t. I had to acount for things sum
      way, so I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mi foeks was living in Piek County, in Missouri, whair I was born,
      and thay all died off but me and paa and mi bruther Ike. Paa, he
      ’lowed he’d braek up and go doun and liv with Unkl Ben, hoo’s
      got a litl wun-hors plaes on th river, forty-foer miel belo Orleans.
      Paa was prity pur, and had sum dets; so when he’d sqaird
      up thair worn’t nuthing left but sixteen dolars and our nigger,
      Jim. That worn’t enuf to taek us forteen hundred miel, dek
      pasej nor no uther way. Wel, when th river roez paa had a streek
      of luk wun day; he ketched this pees of a raft; so we rekond we’d
      go doun to Orleans on it. Paa’s luk didn’t hoeld out; a
      steemboet run oever th forrard corner of th raft wun niet, and we all
      went oeverbord and doev under th wheel; Jim and me cum up all riet, but
      paa was drunk, and Ike was oenly foer yeers oeld, so thay never cum up no
      mor. Wel, for th next day or too we had considerabl trubl,
      becauz peepl was allways cuming out in skifs and trieing to taek Jim away
      frum me, saying thay beleevd he was a runaway nigger. We don’t
      run daytimes no mor now; niets thay don’t bother us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th duek sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Leev me aloen to siefer out a way so we can run in th daytiem if
      we wont to. I’ll think th thing oever—I’ll invent
      a plan that’ll fix it. We’ll let it aloen for to-day, becauz
      of cors we don’t wont to go bi that toun yonder in dayliet—it
      mightn’t be helthy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tords niet it begun to darken up and luuk liek raen; th heet lietning
      was sqerting around lo doun in th skie, and th leevs was begining to
      shiver—it was going to be prity ugly, it was eezy to see that.
      So th duek and th king went to oeverhalling our wigwom, to see whut
      th beds was liek. Mi bed was a straw tik beter than Jim’s,
      which was a corn-shuck tik; thair’s allways cobs around about in a
      shuck tik, and thay poek into u and hert; and when u roel oever th
      dri shuks sound liek u was roeling oever in a piel of ded leevs; it
      maeks such a rusling that u waek up. Wel, th duek alowd he
      wuud taek mi bed; but th king alowd he wouldn’t. He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shuud a rekond th diferens in rank wuud a sejested to u
      that a corn-shuck bed worn’t just fitten for me to sleep on. Yur
      Graes ’ll taek th shuck bed yurself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim and me was in a swet agen for a minit, being afraed thair was going
      to be sum mor trubl amungst them; so we was prity glad when th duek
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “’Tis mi faet to be allways ground into th mier under th ieern
      heel of opreshun. Misforchen has broeken mi wuns hauty spirit; I
      yeeld, I submit; ’tis mi faet. I am aloen in th werld—let
      me sufer; can bair it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We got away as soon as it was guud and dark. Th king toeld us to
      stand wel out tords th midl of th river, and not sho a liet til
      we got a long ways belo th toun. We cum in siet of th litl
      bunch of liets bi and bi—that was th toun, u noe—and slid
      bi, about a haf a miel out, all riet. When we was three-qorters
      of a miel belo we hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o’clok
      it cum on to raen and blo and thunder and lighten liek evrything; so
      th king toeld us to boeth stay on woch til th wether got beter; then
      him and th duek cralld into th wigwom and ternd in for th niet.
      It was mi woch belo til twelv, but I wouldn’t a ternd in
      enyway if I’d had a bed, becauz a body don’t see such a storm
      as that evry day in th week, not bi a long siet. Mi soels, how
      th wiend did screem along! And evry second or too thair’d
      cum a glair that lit up th whiet-caps for a haf a miel around, and u’d
      see th ielands luuking dusty thru th raen, and th trees thrashing
      around in th wiend; then cums a H-Whak!—bum! bum!
      bumbl-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum—and th thunder wuud go rumbling
      and grumbling away, and qit—and then RIP cums anuther flash and
      anuther sockdolager. Th waevs moest wosht me off th raft
      sumtiems, but I hadn’t eny cloeths on, and didn’t miend.
      We didn’t hav no trubl about snags; th lietning was
      glairing and flittering around so constant that we cuud see them plenty
      soon enuf to thro her hed this way or that and mis them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had th midl woch, u noe, but I was prity sleepy bi that tiem, so
      Jim he sed he wuud stand th ferst haf of it for me; he was allways
      miety guud that way, Jim was. I cralld into th wigwom, but th
      king and th duek had thair legs spralld around so thair worn’t no
      sho for me; so I laed outsied—I didn’t miend th raen, becauz
      it was worm, and th waevs worn’t runing so hi now. About
      too thay cum up agen, tho, and Jim was going to call me; but he
      chaenjd his miend, becauz he rekond thay worn’t hi enuf yet to
      do eny harm; but he was mistaeken about that, for prity soon all of a
      suden along cums a reguelar ripper and wosht me oeverbord. It moest
      kild Jim a-lafing. He was th eezyest nigger to laf that ever
      was, enyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tuuk th woch, and Jim he laed doun and snored away; and bi and bi th
      storm let up for guud and all; and th ferst cabin-liet that shoed I
      rousted him out, and we slid th raft into hieding qorters for th day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th king got out an oeld ratty dek of cards after brekfast, and him and
      th duek playd seven-up a whiel, fiev sents a gaem. Then thay got
      tierd of it, and alowd thay wuud “lay out a campaen,” as
      thay calld it. Th duek went doun into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a
      lot of litl printed bils and red them out loud. Wun bil sed,
      “Th selebraeted Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,” wuud
      “lekcher on th Sieens of Frenolojy” at such and such a
      plaes, on th blank day of blank, at ten sents admishun, and “fernish
      charts of carracter at twenty-fiev sents apees.” Th duek
      sed that was <i>him</i>. In anuther bil he was th “werld-renound
      Shakespearian trajeedian, Garrick th Yungger, of Drury Laen, London.”
      In uther bils he had a lot of uther naems and dun uther wunderful
      things, liek fiending wauter and goeld with a “diviening-rod,”
      “disipaeting wich spels,” and so on. Bi and bi he
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But th histrionic muez is th darling. Hav u ever trod
      th bords, Royalty?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” sez th king.
    </p>
    <p>
      “U shal, then, befor u’re three days oelder, Fallen
      Granjer,” sez th duek. “Th ferst guud toun we cum to we’ll
      hier a hall and do th sord fiet in Richard III. and th balcony seen
      in Romeo and Juliet. How duz that striek u?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m in, up to th hub, for enything that wil pay,
      Bilgewater; but, u see, I don’t noe nuthing about play-actin’,
      and hain’t ever seen much of it. I was too small when pap uezd
      to hav ’em at th palas. Do u rekon u can lern me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Eezy!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet. I’m jist a-freezn’ for sumthing
      fresh, enyway. Le’s comens riet away.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So th duek he toeld him all about hoo Romeo was and hoo Juliet was, and
      sed he was uezd to being Romeo, so th king cuud be Juliet.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But if Juliet’s such a yung gal, duek, mi peeld hed and mi
      whiet whiskers is goin’ to luuk oncommon od on her, maybe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, don’t u wery; thees cuntry jakes wun’t ever
      think of that. Besieds, u noe, u’ll be in costoom, and that
      maeks all th diferens in th werld; Juliet’s in a balcony,
      enjoying th moonliet befor she goes to bed, and she’s got on her
      niet-goun and her rufld nightcap. Heer ar th costooms for th
      parts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c20-170" id="c20-170"></a><br> <br>
    </p>

      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      He got out too or three curten-calico soots, which he sed was meedyevil
      armor for Richard III. and t’uther chap, and a long whiet coton
      nietshert and a rufld nightcap to mach. Th king was satisfied;
      so th duek got out his buuk and red th parts oever in th moest splendid
      spred-eegl way, pransing around and acting at th saem tiem, to sho how
      it had got to be dun; then he giv th buuk to th king and toeld him to
      get his part bi hart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thair was a litl wun-hors toun about three miel doun th bend, and
      after diner th duek sed he had ciphered out his iedeea about how to run
      in dayliet without it being dangersome for Jim; so he alowd he wuud go
      doun to th toun and fix that thing. Th king alowd he wuud go,
      too, and see if he couldn’t striek sumthing. We was out of
      coffy, so Jim sed I beter go along with them in th canoo and get sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got thair thair worn’t noebody stering; streets empty, and
      perfectly ded and stil, liek Sunday. We found a sik nigger
      suning himself in a bak yard, and he sed evrybody that worn’t
      too yung or too sik or too oeld was gon to camp-meeting, about too miel
      bak in th wuuds. Th king got th direcshuns, and alowd he’d
      go and werk that camp-meeting for all it was werth, and I miet go, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th duek sed whut he was after was a printing-offis. We found it;
      a litl bit of a consern, up oever a carpenter shop—carpenters and
      printers all gon to th meeting, and no dors lokt. It was a
      derty, literd-up plaes, and had ink marks, and handbills with pikchers
      of horses and runaway niggers on them, all oever th walls. Th duek
      shed his coet and sed he was all riet now. So me and th king lit
      out for th camp-meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got thair in about a haf an our fairly driping, for it was a moest
      awful hot day. Thair was as much as a thouzand peepl thair frum
      twenty miel around. Th wuuds was fuul of teems and wagons, hicht
      everywheres, feeding out of th wagon-traufs and stomping to keep off th
      flies. Thair was sheds maed out of poels and rooft oever with
      branches, whair thay had lemonaed and jinjerbred to sel, and piels of
      watermelons and green corn and such-liek truk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th preeching was going on under th saem kiends of sheds, oenly thay was
      biger and held crouds of peepl. Th benches was maed out of
      outsied slabs of logs, with hoels bord in th round sied to driev stiks
      into for legs. Thay didn’t hav no baks. Th preechers had
      hi platforms to stand on at wun end of th sheds. Th wimen had on
      sun-bonnets; and sum had linsey-woolsey froks, sum gingam wuns, and a
      fue of th yung wuns had on calico. Sum of th yung men was
      bairfuuted, and sum of th children didn’t hav on eny cloeths but
      just a toe-linen shert. Sum of th oeld wimen was niting, and sum
      of th yung foeks was corting on th sli.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Th ferst shed we cum to th preecher was liening out a him. He
      liend out too liens, evrybody sung it, and it was kiend of grand to heer
      it, thair was so meny of them and thay dun it in such a rouzing way; then
      he liend out too mor for them to sing—and so on. Th peepl
      woek up mor and mor, and sung louder and louder; and tords th end
      sum begun to groen, and sum begun to shout. Then th preecher
      begun to preech, and begun in ernest, too; and went weeving ferst to wun
      sied of th platform and then th uther, and then a-leening doun oever th
      frunt of it, with his arms and his body going all th tiem, and shouting
      his werds out with all his miet; and evry now and then he wuud hoeld up
      his Biebl and spred it oepen, and kiend of pas it around this way and
      that, shouting, “It’s th braezen serpent in th wildernes!
      Luuk upon it and liv!” And peepl wuud shout out,
      “Glory!—A-a-<i>men</i>!” And so he went on, and
      th peepl groening and crieing and saying aamen:
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, cum to th morners’ bench! cum, blak with sin! (<i>Aamen</i>!)
      cum, sik and sor! (<i>Aamen</i>!) cum, laem and hallt and bliend! (<i>Aamen</i>!)
      cum, por and needy, sunk in shaem! (<i>A-A-Men</i>!) cum, all that’s
      worn and soild and sufering!—cum with a broeken spirit! cum with
      a contriet hart! cum in yur rags and sin and dert! th wauters that
      clenz is free, th dor of heven stands oepen—o, enter in and be
      at rest!” (<i>A-A-Men</i>! <i>Glory, Glory Halelooya!</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      And so on. U couldn’t maek out whut th preecher sed eny
      mor, on acount of th shouting and crieing. Foeks got up
      everywheres in th croud, and werkt thair way just bi maen strength to
      th morners’ bench, with th teers runing doun thair faeses; and
      when all th morners had got up thair to th frunt benches in a croud,
      thay sung and shouted and flung themselvs doun on th straw, just craezy
      and wield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, th ferst I knowed th king got a-going, and u cuud heer him oever
      evrybody; and next he went a-charjing up on to th platform, and th
      preecher he begd him to speek to th peepl, and he dun it. He
      toeld them he was a pieret—bin a pieret for therty yeers out in th
      Indian Oeshan—and his croo was thind out considerabl last spring
      in a fiet, and he was hoem now to taek out sum fresh men, and thanks to
      guudnes he’d bin robd last niet and puut ashor off of a
      steemboet without a sent, and he was glad of it; it was th blessedest
      thing that ever hapend to him, becauz he was a chaenjd man now, and
      hapy for th ferst tiem in his lief; and, pur as he was, he was going to
      start riet off and werk his way bak to th Indian Oeshan, and puut in th
      rest of his lief trieing to tern th pierets into th troo path; for he
      cuud do it beter than enybody els, being aqaented with all pieret
      croos in that oeshan; and tho it wuud taek him a long tiem to get thair
      without muny, he wuud get thair enyway, and evry tiem he convinst a
      pieret he wuud say to him, “Don’t u thank me, don’t
      u giv me no credit; it all belongs to them deer peepl in Pokeville
      camp-meeting, nacheral bruthers and benefactors of th raes, and that deer
      preecher thair, th trooest frend a pieret ever had!”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c20-174" id="c20-174"></a><br> <br>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c20-174.jpg (45K)" src="./HuckFinn_files/c20-174.jpg" style="width:100%;"><br>
    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he busted into teers, and so did evrybody. Then sumbody
      sings out, “Taek up a colecshun for him, taek up a colecshun!”
      Wel, a haf a duzen maed a jump to do it, but sumbody sings out,
      “Let <i>him</i> pas th hat around!” Then evrybody
      sed it, th preecher too.
    </p>
    <p>
      So th king went all thru th croud with his hat swobing his ies, and
      blesing th peepl and praezing them and thanking them for being so guud
      to th pur pierets away off thair; and evry litl whiel th prityest
      kiend of gerls, with th teers runing doun thair cheeks, wuud up and ask
      him wuud he let them kis him for to remember him bi; and he allways dun
      it; and sum of them he hugd and kist as meny as fiev or six tiems—and
      he was invieted to stay a week; and evrybody wonted him to liv in thair
      houses, and sed thay’d think it was an onor; but he sed as this
      was th last day of th camp-meeting he couldn’t do no guud, and
      besieds he was in a swet to get to th Indian Oeshan riet off and go to
      werk on th pierets.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got bak to th raft and he cum to count up he found he had
      colected aety-seven dolars and seventy-fiev sents. And then he
      had fetched away a three-galon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a
      wagon when he was starting hoem thru th wuuds. Th king sed,
      taek it all around, it laed oever eny day he’d ever puut in in th
      missionarying lien. He sed it worn’t no ues tauking, heathens
      don’t amount to shuks alongsied of pierets to werk a camp-meeting
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th duek was thinking <i>he’d</i> bin doing prity wel til th
      king cum to sho up, but after that he didn’t think so so much.
      He had set up and printed off too litl jobs for farmers in that
      printing-offis—hors bils—and tuuk th muny, foer dolars.
      And he had got in ten dolars’ werth of advertiezments for th
      paeper, which he sed he wuud puut in for foer dolars if thay wuud pay in
      advans—so thay dun it. Th pries of th paeper was too dolars a
      yeer, but he tuuk in three subscriptions for haf a dolar apees on
      condishun of them paying him in advans; thay wer going to pay in
      cordwood and unyons as uezhual, but he sed he had just baut th consern
      and nokt doun th pries as lo as he cuud aford it, and was going to
      run it for cash. He set up a litl pees of poeetry, which he maed,
      himself, out of his oen hed—three verses—kiend of sweet and
      saddish—th naem of it was, “Yes, crush, coeld werld, this
      braeking hart”—and he left that all set up and redy to print
      in th paeper, and didn’t charj nuthing for it. Wel, he tuuk
      in nien dolars and a haf, and sed he’d dun a prity sqair day’s
      werk for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he shoed us anuther litl job he’d printed and hadn’t
      charjd for, becauz it was for us. It had a pikcher of a runaway
      nigger with a bundl on a stik oever his shoelder, and “$200 reword”
      under it. Th reeding was all about Jim, and just descriebd him to a
      dot. It sed he run away frum St. Jacques’ plantaeshun, forty
      miel belo Nue Orleans, last winter, and liekly went north, and hooever
      wuud cach him and send him bak he cuud hav th reword and expenses.

      “Now,” sez th duek, “after to-niet we can run in th
      daytiem if we wont to. Whenever we see enybody cuming we can tee Jim
      hand and fuut with a roep, and lay him in th wigwom and sho this
      handbil and say we capcherd him up th river, and wer too pur to travel
      on a steemboet, so we got this litl raft on credit frum our frends and
      ar going doun to get th reword. Handcufs and chaens wuud luuk
      stil beter on Jim, but it wouldn’t go wel with th story of us
      being so pur. Too much liek jooelry. Roeps ar th corect
      thing—we must prezerv th uenitys, as we say on th bords.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We all sed th duek was prity smart, and thair couldn’t be no
      trubl about runing daytimes. We jujd we cuud maek miels enuf
      that niet to get out of th reech of th powwow we rekond th duek’s
      werk in th printing offis was going to maek in that litl toun; then we
      cuud boom riet along if we wonted to.
    </p>
    <p>
      We laed lo and kept stil, and never shuvd out til neerly ten o’clok;
      then we slid bi, prity wied away frum th toun, and didn’t hoist
      our lantern til we was cleer out of siet of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jim calld me to taek th woch at foer in th morning, he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Huck, duz u reck’n we gwyne to run acrost eny mo’ 
      kings on dis trip?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” I sez, “I rekon not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” sez he, “dat’s all riet, den. I
      doan’ mien wun er too kings, but dat’s enuf. Dis wun’s
      powerful drunk, en de duek ain’ much beter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Jim had bin trieing to get him to tauk French, so he cuud heer
      whut it was liek; but he sed he had bin in this cuntry so long, and had
      so much trubl, he’d forgot it.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXI.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after sun-up now, but we went riet on and didn’t tee up.
      Th king and th duek ternd out bi and bi luuking prity rusty; but
      after thay’d jumpt oeverbord and tuuk a swim it chippered them up a
      guud deel. After brekfast th king he tuuk a seet on th corner of th
      raft, and puuld off his boots and roeld up his briches, and let his
      legs danggl in th wauter, so as to be cumfortabl, and lit his piep, and
      went to geting his Romeo and Juliet bi hart. When he had got it
      prity guud him and th duek begun to practis it together. Th duek
      had to lern him oever and oever agen how to say evry speech; and he maed
      him si, and puut his hand on his hart, and after a whiel he sed he dun
      it prity wel; “oenly,” he sez, “u mustn’t
      belo out <i>Romeo</i>! that way, liek a buul—u must say it sofft
      and sik and languishy, so—R-o-o-meo! that is th iedeea; for Juliet’s
      a deer sweet meer chield of a gerl, u noe, and she doesn’t bray
      liek a jakas.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, next thay got out a cupl of long sords that th duek maed out of
      oek laths, and begun to practis th sord fiet—th duek calld
      himself Richard III.; and th way thay laed on and pranced around th raft
      was grand to see. But bi and bi th king tript and fel oeverbord,
      and after that thay tuuk a rest, and had a tauk about all kiends of
      advenchers thay’d had in uther tiems along th river.
    </p>
    <p>
      After diner th duek sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, Capet, we’ll wont to maek this a ferst-clas sho, u
      noe, so I ges we’ll ad a litl mor to it. We wont a
      litl sumthing to anser oncors with, enyway.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut’s onkores, Bilgewater?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th duek toeld him, and then sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll anser bi doing th Hieland fling or th saelor’s
      hornpiep; and u—wel, let me see—o, I’ve got it—u
      can do Hamlet’s soliloqy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hamlet’s which?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hamlet’s soliloqy, u noe; th moest selebraeted thing in
      Shakespeare. Aa, it’s subliem, subliem! Allways fetches th
      hous. I haeven’t got it in th buuk—I’ve oenly got
      wun voluem—but I rekon I can pees it out frum memory. I’ll
      just wauk up and doun a minit, and see if I can call it bak frum

      So he went to marching up and doun, thinking, and frouning horribl evry
      now and then; then he wuud hoist up his iebrows; next he wuud sqeez
      his hand on his forhed and stager bak and kiend of moen; next he wuud
      si, and next he’d let on to drop a teer. It was buetiful to
      see him. Bi and bi he got it. He toeld us to giv atenshun. Then
      he strieks a moest noebl atitued, with wun leg shuvd forwards, and his
      arms strecht away up, and his hed tilted bak, luuking up at th skie;
      and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that, all
      thru his speech, he hould, and spred around, and sweld up his
      chest, and just nokt th spots out of eny acting ever I see befor.
      This is th speech—I lernd it, eezy enuf, whiel he was

      Then we went loafing around th toun. Th stors and houses was moest all
      oeld shackly dried-up fraem conserns that hadn’t ever bin paented;
      thay was set up three or foer fuut abuv ground on stilts, so as to be out
      of reech of th wauter when th river was oeverfloed. Th houses had litl
      gardens around them, but thay didn’t seem to raez hardly enything
      in them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piels, and oeld
      curld-up boots and shoos, and peeses of botls, and rags, and playd-out
      tin-wair. Th fenses was maed of diferent kiends of bords, naeld on at
      diferent tiems; and thay leend evry which-way, and had gaets that didn’t
      generly hav but wun hinj—a lether wun. Sum of th fenses had
      bin whietwosht, sum tiem or anuther, but th duek sed it was in
      Clumbus’s tiem, liek enuf. Thair was generly hogs in th garden,
      and peepl drieving them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      All th stors was along wun street. Thay had whiet domestic aunings
      in frunt, and th cuntry peepl hicht thair horses to th auning-poests.
      Thair was empty drygoods boxes under th aunings, and loefers roosting on
      them all day long, whittling them with thair Barlow nievs; and chawing
      tobaco, and gaeping and yauning and streching—a miety ornery lot.
      Thay generly had on yelo straw hats moest as wied as an umbrela, but
      didn’t wair no coets nor waistcoats, thay calld wun anuther Bil,
      and Buk, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and taukt laezy and drawly, and
      uezd considerabl meny cuss werds. Thair was as meny as wun loefer
      leening up agenst evry auning-poest, and he moest allways had his hands in
      his briches-pokets, exsept when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of
      tobaco or scrach. Whut a body was heering amungst them all th
      tiem was:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gimme a chaw ’v tobacker, Hank.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cain’t; I hain’t got but wun chaw left. Ask Bil.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c21-182" id="c21-182"></a><br> <br>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe Bil he givs him a chaw; maybe he lies and sez he ain’t got
      nun. Sum of them kiends of loefers never has a sent in th werld, nor a
      chaw of tobaco of thair oen. Thay get all thair chawing bi
      borroeing; thay say to a felo, “I wisht u’d len’ me
      a chaw, Jak, I jist this minit giv Ben Thompson th last chaw I had”—which
      is a lie prity much everytime; it don’t fool noebody but a straenjer;
      but Jak ain’t no straenjer, so he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>U</i> giv him a chaw, did u? So did yur sister’s
      cat’s grandmuther. U pay me bak th chaws u’ve awready
      borry’d off’n me, Lafe Buckner, then I’ll loen u wun
      or too tun of it, and wun’t charj u no bak intrust, nuther.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I <i>did</i> pay u bak sum of it wunst.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, u did—’bout six chaws. U borry’d
      stor tobacker and paed bak nigger-hed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Stor tobaco is flat blak plug, but thees feloes moestly chaws th
      nacheral leef twisted. When thay borro a chaw thay don’t
      generly cut it off with a nief, but set th plug in between thair teeth,
      and naw with thair teeth and tug at th plug with thair hands til thay
      get it in too; then sumtiems th wun that oens th tobaco luuks mornful
      at it when it’s handed bak, and sez, sarcastic:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heer, gimme th <i>chaw</i>, and u taek th <i>plug</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      All th streets and laens was just mud; thay worn’t nuthing els <i>but</i>
      mud—mud as blak as tar and ni about a fuut deep in sum plaeses,
      and too or three inches deep in <i>all</i> th plaeses. Th hogs
      loeft and grunted around everywheres. U’d see a mudy soe
      and a liter of pigs cum lazying along th street and whollop herself
      riet doun in th way, whair foeks had to wauk around her, and she’d
      strech out and shut her ies and waev her eers whilst th pigs was
      milking her, and luuk as hapy as if she was on salary. And prity soon
      u’d heer a loefer sing out, “Hi! <i>so</i> boy! sik
      him, Tige!” and away th soe wuud go, sqeeling moest horribl, with
      a daug or too swinging to eech eer, and three or foer duzen mor a-cuming;
      and then u wuud see all th loefers get up and woch th thing out of
      siet, and laf at th fun and luuk graetful for th noiz. Then
      thay’d setl bak agen til thair was a daug fiet. Thair
      couldn’t enything waek them up all oever, and maek them hapy all
      oever, liek a daug fiet—unles it miet be puuting terpentien on a
      stray daug and seting fier to him, or tieing a tin pan to his tael and see
      him run himself to deth.
    </p>
    <p>
      On th river frunt sum of th houses was stiking out oever th bank, and
      thay was boed and bent, and about redy to tumbl in. Th peepl had
      moovd out of them. Th bank was caevd away under wun corner of sum
      uthers, and that corner was hanging oever. Peepl livd in them yet,
      but it was dangersome, becauz sumtiems a strip of land as wied as a
      hous caevs in at a tiem. Sumtiems a belt of land a qorter of a
      miel deep wil start in and caev along and caev along til it all caevs
      into th river in wun sumer. Such a toun as that has to be allways mooving
      bak, and bak, and bak, becauz th river’s allways nawing at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th neerer it got to noon that day th thiker and thiker was th wagons
      and horses in th streets, and mor cuming all th tiem. Familys
      fetched thair diners with them frum th cuntry, and eet them in th
      wagons. Thair was considerabl whisky drinking going on, and I seen
      three fiets. Bi and bi sumbody sings out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heer cums oeld Boggs!—in frum th cuntry for his litl oeld
      munthly drunk; heer he cums, boys!”
    </p>
    <p>
      All th loefers luukt glad; I rekond thay was uezd to having fun out of
      Boggs. Wun of them sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wunder hoo he’s a-gwyne to chaw up this tiem. If he’d
      a-chawed up all th men he’s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in th last
      twenty yeer he’d hav considerabl ruputation now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Anuther wun sez, “I wisht oeld Boggs ’d threten me, ’cuz
      then I’d noe I worn’t gwyne to die for a thousan’ yeer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Boggs cums a-tairing along on his hors, hooping and yeling liek an
      Injun, and singing out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cler th trak, thar. I’m on th waw-path, and th
      pries uv coffins is a-gwyne to raez.”

      He was drunk, and weeving about in his sadl; he was oever fifty yeer oeld,
      and had a verry red faes. Evrybody yeld at him and laft at him
      and sassed him, and he sassed bak, and sed he’d atend to them and
      lay them out in thair reguelar terns, but he couldn’t waet now
      becauz he’d cum to toun to kil oeld Curnel Sherburn, and his
      moto was, “Meet ferst, and spoon vittles to top off on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He see me, and roed up and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whar’d u cum f’m, boy? U prepaird to die?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he roed on. I was scaird, but a man sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “He don’t meen nuthing; he’s allways a-carryin’ on
      liek that when he’s drunk. He’s th best naturedest oeld
      fool in Arkansaw—never hert noebody, drunk nor soeber.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Boggs roed up befor th bigest stor in toun, and bent his hed doun so
      he cuud see under th curten of th auning and yels:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cum out heer, Sherburn! Cum out and meet th man u’ve
      swindld. U’re th houn’ I’m after, and I’m
      a-gwyne to hav u, too!”
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he went on, calling Sherburn evrything he cuud lay his tung to,
      and th hoel street pakt with peepl lisening and lafing and going
      on. Bi and bi a proud-luuking man about fifty-fiev—and he was
      a heep th best drest man in that toun, too—steps out of th
      stor, and th croud drops bak on eech sied to let him cum. He
      sez to Boggs, miety ca’m and slo—he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m tierd of this, but I’ll endur it til wun o’clok.
      Til wun o’clok, miend—no longger. If u oepen yur
      mouth agenst me oenly wuns after that tiem u can’t travel so far

    <p>
      Then he terns and goes in. Th croud luukt miety soeber; noebody
      sterd, and thair worn’t no mor lafing. Boggs roed off
      blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he cuud yel, all doun th street; and
      prity soon bak he cums and stops befor th stor, stil keeping it up.
      Sum men crouded around him and tried to get him to shut up, but he
      wouldn’t; thay toeld him it wuud be wun o’clok in about
      fifteen minits, and so he <i>must</i> go hoem—he must go riet
      away. But it didn’t do no guud. He cussed away with all
      his miet, and throwed his hat doun in th mud and roed oever it, and
      prity soon away he went a-raejing doun th street agen, with his gray
      hair a-flieing. Evrybody that cuud get a chans at him tried thair best
      to coex him off of his hors so thay cuud lok him up and get him soeber;
      but it worn’t no ues—up th street he wuud teer agen, and
      giv Sherburn anuther cussing. Bi and bi sumbody sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go for his dauter!—qik, go for his dauter; sumtiems he’ll
      lisen to her. If enybody can perswaed him, she can.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So sumbody started on a run. I waukt doun street a ways and
      stopt. In about fiev or ten minits heer cums Boggs agen, but not on
      his hors. He was a-reeling across th street tords me,
      bair-heded, with a frend on boeth sieds of him a-holt of his arms and
      herying him along. He was qieet, and luukt uneezy; and he worn’t
      hanging bak eny, but was doing sum of th herying himself. Sumbody
      sings out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Boggs!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I luukt oever thair to see hoo sed it, and it was that Curnel Sherburn.
      He was standing perfectly stil in th street, and had a pistol raezd in
      his riet hand—not aeming it, but hoelding it out with th barrel
      tilted up tords th skie. Th saem second I see a yung gerl cuming
      on th run, and too men with her. Boggs and th men ternd round to
      see hoo calld him, and when thay see th pistol th men jumpt to wun
      sied, and th pistol-barrel cum doun slo and stedy to a level—boeth
      barrels cokt. Boggs throes up boeth of his hands and sez, “O Lord,
      don’t shoot!” Bang! goes th ferst shot, and he stagers
      bak, clawing at th air—bang! goes th second wun, and he tumbls
      bakwards on to th ground, hevy and solid, with his arms spred out.
      That yung gerl screemd out and cums rushing, and doun she throes
      herself on her faather, crieing, and saying, “O, he’s kild
      him, he’s kild him!” Th croud cloezd up around them,
      and shoelderd and jamd wun anuther, with thair neks strecht, trieing
      to see, and peepl on th insied trieing to shuv them bak and shouting,
      “Bak, bak! giv him air, giv him air!”

      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Curnel Sherburn he tosst his pistol on to th ground, and ternd around
      on his heels and waukt off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay tuuk Boggs to a litl drug stor, th croud presing around just th
      saem, and th hoel toun foloeing, and I rusht and got a guud plaes at
      th windo, whair I was cloez to him and cuud see in. Thay laed him
      on th flor and puut wun larj Biebl under his hed, and oepend anuther
      wun and spred it on his brest; but thay tore oepen his shert ferst, and I
      seen whair wun of th buulets went in. He maed about a duzen long
      gasps, his brest lifting th Biebl up when he drawed in his breth, and
      leting it doun agen when he breethd it out—and after that he laed
      stil; he was ded. Then thay puuld his dauter away frum him,
      screeming and crieing, and tuuk her off. She was about sixteen, and
      verry sweet and jentl luuking, but awful pael and scaird.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, prity soon th hoel toun was thair, sqerming and scrouging and
      puushing and shuving to get at th windo and hav a luuk, but peepl that
      had th plaeses wouldn’t giv them up, and foeks behiend them was
      saying all th tiem, “Say, now, u’ve luukt enuf, u
      feloes; ’tain’t riet and ’tain’t fair for u to
      stay thar all th tiem, and never giv noebody a chans; uther foeks has
      thair riets as wel as u.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thair was considerabl jawing bak, so I slid out, thinking maybe thair
      was going to be trubl. Th streets was fuul, and evrybody was
      exsieted. Evrybody that seen th shooting was teling how it hapend, and
      thair was a big croud pakt around eech wun of thees feloes, streching
      thair neks and lisening. Wun long, lanky man, with long hair and a
      big whiet fer stoevpiep hat on th bak of his hed, and a cruuked-handld
      caen, markt out th plaeses on th ground whair Boggs stuud and whair
      Sherburn stuud, and th peepl foloeing him around frum wun plaes to t’uther
      and woching evrything he dun, and bobing thair heds to sho thay
      understuud, and stooping a litl and resting thair hands on thair thies
      to woch him mark th plaeses on th ground with his caen; and then he
      stuud up straet and stif whair Sherburn had stuud, frouning and having
      his hat-brim doun oever his ies, and sung out, “Boggs!” and
      then fetched his caen doun slo to a level, and sez “Bang!”
      stagerd bakwards, sez “Bang!” agen, and fel doun flat on
      his bak. Th peepl that had seen th thing sed he dun it perfect; sed
      it was just exactly th way it all hapend. Then as much as a duzen
      peepl got out thair botls and treeted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, bi and bi sumbody sed Sherburn aut to be lincht. In about
      a minit evrybody was saying it; so away thay went, mad and yeling, and
      snaching doun evry cloeths-lien thay cum to to do th hanging with.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXII.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay swormd up tords Sherburn’s hous, a-hooping and raejing liek
      Injuns, and evrything had to cleer th way or get run oever and tromped to
      mush, and it was awful to see. Children was heeling it ahed of th
      mob, screeming and trieing to get out of th way; and evry windo along
      th roed was fuul of wimen’s heds, and thair was nigger boys in
      evry tree, and buks and wenches luuking oever evry fens; and as soon as
      th mob wuud get neerly to them thay wuud braek and skaddle bak out of
      reech. Lots of th wimen and gerls was crieing and taeking on, scaird
      moest to deth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay swormd up in frunt of Sherburn’s palings as thik as thay
      cuud jam together, and u couldn’t heer yurself think for th
      noiz. It was a litl twenty-fuut yard. Sum sung out “Teer
      doun th fens! teer doun th fens!” Then thair was a raket
      of riping and tairing and smashing, and doun she goes, and th frunt wall
      of th croud begins to roel in liek a waev.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Sherburn steps out on to th roof of his litl frunt porch,
      with a dubl-barrel gun in his hand, and taeks his stand, perfectly ca’m
      and deliberaet, not saying a werd. Th raket stopt, and th waev
      sukt bak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherburn never sed a werd—just stuud thair, luuking doun. Th
      stilnes was awful creepy and uncumfortabl. Sherburn run his ie
      slo along th croud; and whairever it struk th peepl tried a litl to
      out-gaez him, but thay couldn’t; thay dropt thair ies and luukt
      sneeky. Then prity soon Sherburn sort of laft; not th plezant kiend,
      but th kiend that maeks u feel liek when u ar eeting bred that’s
      got sand in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sez, slo and scornful:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th iedeea of <i>u</i> lynching enybody! It’s amuezing.
      Th iedeea of u thinking u had pluk enuf to linch a <i>man</i>!
      Becauz u’re braev enuf to tar and fether pur frendles
      cast-out wimen that cum along heer, did that maek u think u had grit
      enuf to lay yur hands on a <i>man</i>? Whi, a <i>man’s</i>
      saef in th hands of ten thouzand of yur kiend—as long as it’s
      daytiem and u’re not behiend him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do I noe u? I noe u cleer thru. I was born and
      raezd in th South, and I’ve livd in th North; so I noe th
      averej all around. Th averej man’s a coward. In th North
      he lets enybody wauk oever him that wonts to, and goes hoem and prays for a
      humbl spirit to bair it. In th South wun man all bi himself, has stopt
      a staej fuul of men in th daytiem, and robd th lot. Yur
      nuespaepers call u a braev peepl so much that u think u ar braever
      than eny uther peepl—whairas u’re just <i>as</i> braev, and
      no braever. Whi don’t yur jurys hang merderers? Becauz
      thay’re afraed th man’s frends wil shoot them in th bak,
      in th dark—and it’s just whut thay <i>wuud</i> do.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So thay allways aqit; and then a <i>man</i> goes in th niet,
      with a hundred maskt cowards at his bak and lynches th rascal. Yur
      mistaek is, that u didn’t bring a man with u; that’s wun
      mistaek, and th uther is that u didn’t cum in th dark and fech
      yur masks. U braut <i>part</i> of a man—Buk Harkness,
      thair—and if u hadn’t had him to start u, u’d a
      taeken it out in bloeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “U didn’t wont to cum. Th averej man don’t
      liek trubl and daenjer. <i>U</i> don’t liek trubl and daenjer.
      But if oenly <i>haf</i> a man—liek Buk Harkness, thair—shouts
      ’Linch him! linch him!’ u’re afraed to bak doun—afraed
      u’ll be found out to be whut u ar—<i>cowards</i>—and
      so u raez a yel, and hang yurselvs on to that haf-a-man’s
      coet-tael, and cum raejing up heer, swairing whut big things u’re
      going to do. Th pitifulest thing out is a mob; that’s whut an army
      is—a mob; thay don’t fiet with curej that’s born in
      them, but with curej that’s borroed frum thair mas, and frum
      thair offisers. But a mob without eny <i>man</i> at th hed of it
      is <i>beneeth</i> pitifulness. Now th thing for <i>u</i> to do is
      to droop yur taels and go hoem and crall in a hoel. If eny reeal
      lynching’s going to be dun it wil be dun in th dark, Suthern
      fashun; and when thay cum thay’ll bring thair masks, and fech a
      <i>man</i> along. Now <i>leev</i>—and taek yur haf-a-man
      with u”—tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking
      it when he sez this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th croud wosht bak suden, and then broek all apart, and went tairing
      off evry which way, and Buk Harkness he heeled it after them, luuking
      tolerabl cheep. I cuud a stayd if I wonted to, but I didn’t
      wont to.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to th sercus and loeft around th bak sied til th wochman
      went bi, and then dievd in under th tent. I had mi twenty-dolar
      goeld pees and sum uther muny, but I rekond I beter saev it, becauz
      thair ain’t no teling how soon u ar going to need it, away frum
      hoem and amungst straenjers that way. U can’t be too cairful.
      I ain’t opoezd to spending muny on circuses when thair ain’t
      no uther way, but thair ain’t no ues in <i>waesting</i> it on them.

    <p>
      It was a reeal buuly sercus. It was th splendidest siet that ever
      was when thay all cum rieding in, too and too, a jentlman and laedy, sied
      bi sied, th men just in thair drors and undersherts, and no shoos nor
      stirrups, and resting thair hands on thair thies eezy and cumfortabl—thair
      must a bin twenty of them—and evry laedy with a luvly complexshun,
      and perfectly buetiful, and luuking just liek a gang of reeal shur-enuf
      qeens, and drest in cloeths that cost milyons of dolars, and just
      literd with diemonds. It was a powerful fien siet; I never see
      enything so luvly. And then wun bi wun thay got up and stuud, and
      went a-weeving around th ring so jentl and waevy and graesful, th men
      luuking ever so tall and airy and straet, with thair heds bobing and
      skiming along, away up thair under th tent-roof, and evry laedy’s
      roez-leefy dres flaping sofft and silky around her hips, and she luuking
      liek th moest luvlyest parrasol.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then faster and faster thay went, all of them dansing, ferst wun fuut
      out in th air and then th uther, th horses leening mor and mor, and
      th ringmaster going round and round th senter-poel, craking his whip
      and shouting “Hi!—hi!” and th cloun craking joeks
      behiend him; and bi and bi all hands dropt th raens, and evry laedy puut
      her nukls on her hips and evry jentlman foelded his arms, and then how
      th horses did leen oever and hump themselvs! And so wun after th
      uther thay all skipt off into th ring, and maed th sweetest bo I ever
      see, and then scamperd out, and evrybody clapt thair hands and went
      just about wield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, all thru th sercus thay dun th moest astonishing things; and
      all th tiem that cloun carryd on so it moest kild th peepl. Th
      ringmaster couldn’t ever say a werd to him but he was bak at him
      qik as a wink with th funyest things a body ever sed; and how he ever
      <i>cuud</i> think of so meny of them, and so suden and so pat, was whut
      I couldn’t noeway understand. Whi, I couldn’t a thaut of them
      in a yeer. And bi and bi a drunk man tried to get into th ring—sed
      he wonted to ried; sed he cuud ried as wel as enybody that ever was.
      Thay argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn’t lisen,
      and th hoel sho cum to a standstil. Then th peepl begun to
      holler at him and maek fun of him, and that maed him mad, and he begun to
      rip and teer; so that sterd up th peepl, and a lot of men begun to
      piel doun off of th benches and sworm tords th ring, saying, “Nok
      him doun! thro him out!” and wun or too wimen begun to screem.
      So, then, th ringmaster he maed a litl speech, and sed he hoept
      thair wouldn’t be no disterbans, and if th man wuud promis he
      wouldn’t maek no mor trubl he wuud let him ried if he thaut he
      cuud stay on th hors. So evrybody laft and sed all riet,
      and th man got on. Th minit he was on, th hors begun to rip and teer
      and jump and cavort around, with too sercus men hanging on to his briedl
      trieing to hoeld him, and th drunk man hanging on to his nek, and his
      heels flieing in th air evry jump, and th hoel croud of peepl standing
      up shouting and lafing til teers roeld doun. And at last, shur
      enuf, all th sercus men cuud do, th hors broek loos, and away he
      went liek th verry naeshun, round and round th ring, with that sot laying
      doun on him and hanging to his nek, with ferst wun leg hanging moest to
      th ground on wun sied, and then t’uther wun on t’uther sied,
      and th peepl just craezy. It worn’t funy to me, tho; I
      was all of a trembl to see his daenjer. But prity soon he strugld
      up astraddle and grabd th briedl, a-reeling this way and that; and th
      next minit he sprung up and dropt th briedl and stuud! and th hors
      a-going liek a hous afier too. He just stuud up thair, a-saeling
      around as eezy and cumfortabl as if he worn’t ever drunk in his
      lief—and then he begun to puul off his cloeths and sling them.
      He shed them so thik thay kiend of clogd up th air, and
      alltogether he shed seventeen soots. And, then, thair he was, slim and
      hansum, and drest th gaudiest and prityest u ever saw, and he lit
      into that hors with his whip and maed him fairly hum—and fienaly
      skipt off, and maed his bo and danst off to th dresing-room, and
      evrybody just a-houling with plezher and astonishment.

      Then th ringmaster he see how he had bin foold, and he <i>was</i> th
      sickest ringmaster u ever see, I rekon. Whi, it was wun of his
      oen men! He had got up that joek all out of his oen hed, and never
      let on to noebody. Wel, I felt sheepish enuf to be tuuk in so, but I
      wouldn’t a bin in that ringmaster’s plaes, not for a thouzand
      dolars. I don’t noe; thair may be bullier circuses than whut
      that wun was, but I never struk them yet. Enyways, it was plenty guud
      enuf for <i>me</i>; and whairever I run across it, it can hav all of <i>mi</i>
      custom evry tiem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, that niet we had <i>our</i> sho; but thair worn’t oenly about
      twelv peepl thair—just enuf to pay expenses. And thay
      laft all th tiem, and that maed th duek mad; and evrybody left,
      enyway, befor th sho was oever, but wun boy which was asleep. So
      th duek sed thees Arkansaw lunkheads couldn’t cum up to
      Shakespeare; whut thay wonted was lo comedy—and maybe sumthing
      ruther wers than lo comedy, he rekond. He sed he cuud siez
      thair stiel. So next morning he got sum big sheets of raping
      paeper and sum blak paent, and drawed off sum handbills, and stuk them
      up all oever th vilej. Th bils sed:

      jam fuul of men in no tiem. When th plaes couldn’t hoeld no

      on to th staej and stuud up befor th curten and maed a litl speech,
      and praezd up this trajedy, and sed it was th moest thrillingest wun
      that ever was; and so he went on a-braging about th trajedy, and about
      Edmund Kean th Elder, which was to play th maen prinsipal part in it;
      and at last when he’d got evrybody’s expectaeshuns up hi
      enuf, he roeld up th curten, and th next minit th king cum
      a-pransing out on all foers, naeked; and he was paented all oever,
      ring-streekt-and-striept, all sorts of culors, as splendid as a raenbo.
      And—but never miend th rest of his outfit; it was just wield,
      but it was awful funy. Th peepl moest kild themselvs lafing; and
      when th king got dun caepering and capered off behiend th seens, thay
      rord and clapt and stormd and haw-hawed til he cum bak and dun it
      oever agen, and after that thay maed him do it anuther tiem. Wel, it
      wuud maek a cow laf to see th shiens that oeld idiot cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then th duek he lets th curten doun, and boes to th peepl, and sez
      th graet trajedy wil be performd oenly too niets mor, on acounts of
      presing London engaejments, whair th seets is all soeld allredy for it in
      Drury Laen; and then he maeks them anuther bo, and sez if he has
      sucseeded in pleezing them and instructing them, he wil be deeply
      obleeged if thay wil menshun it to thair frends and get them to cum and
      see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty peepl sings out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut, is it oever? Is that <i>all</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th duek sez yes. Then thair was a fien tiem. Evrybody sings
      out, “Soeld!” and roez up mad, and was a-going for that staej
      and them trajeedians. But a big, fien luuking man jumps up on a bench
      and shouts:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoeld on! Just a werd, jentlmen.” Thay stopt to
      lisen. “We ar soeld—miety badly soeld. But we don’t
      wont to be th lafing stok of this hoel toun, I rekon, and never heer
      th last of this thing as long as we liv. <i>No</i>. Whut we
      wont is to go out of heer qieet, and tauk this sho up, and sel th <i>rest</i>
      of th toun! Then we’ll all be in th saem boet. Ain’t
      that sensibl?” (“U bet it is!—th jedge is riet!”
      evrybody sings out.) “All riet, then—not a werd about eny
      sel. Go along hoem, and adviez evrybody to cum and see th
      trajedy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day u couldn’t heer nuthing around that toun but how splendid
      that sho was. Hous was jamd agen that niet, and we soeld this
      croud th saem way. When me and th king and th duek got hoem to
      th raft we all had a super; and bi and bi, about midniet, thay maed Jim
      and me bak her out and floet her doun th midl of th river, and fech
      her in and hied her about too miel belo toun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th therd niet th hous was cramd agen—and thay worn’t
      nue-comers this tiem, but peepl that was at th sho th uther too
      niets. I stuud bi th duek at th dor, and I see that evry man
      that went in had his pokets buljing, or sumthing mufld up under his
      coet—and I see it worn’t no perfuemery, neether, not bi a long
      siet. I smelt sikly egs bi th barrel, and roten cabbages, and
      such things; and if I noe th siens of a ded cat being around, and I bet
      I do, thair was sixty-foer of them went in. I shuvd in thair for a
      minit, but it was too vairius for me; I couldn’t stand it. Wel,
      when th plaes couldn’t hoeld no mor peepl th duek he giv a
      felo a qorter and toeld him to tend dor for him a minit, and then he
      started around for th staej dor, I after him; but th minit we ternd
      th corner and was in th dark he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wauk fast now til u get away frum th houses, and then shin for
      th raft liek th dickens was after u!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I dun it, and he dun th saem. We struk th raft at th saem
      tiem, and in les than too seconds we was gliding doun streem, all dark
      and stil, and ejing tords th midl of th river, noebody saying a
      werd. I rekond th pur king was in for a gaudy tiem of it with th
      audyens, but nuthing of th sort; prity soon he cralls out frum under
      th wigwom, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, how’d th oeld thing pan out this tiem, duek?”
      He hadn’t bin up-toun at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      We never shoed a liet til we was about ten miel belo th vilej. Then
      we lit up and had a super, and th king and th duek fairly laft thair
      boens loos oever th way thay’d servd them peepl. Th duek
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Greenhorns, flatheads! I nue th ferst hous wuud keep mum
      and let th rest of th toun get roept in; and I nue thay’d lay for
      us th therd niet, and consider it was <i>thair</i> tern now. Wel,
      it <i>is</i> thair tern, and I’d giv sumthing to noe how much
      thay’d taek for it. I <i>wuud</i> just liek to noe how thay’re
      puuting in thair oportuenity. Thay can tern it into a picnik if thay
      wont to—thay braut plenty provizhuns.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Them rapscallions tuuk in foer hundred and sixty-fiev dolars in that
      three niets. I never see muny halld in bi th wagon-loed liek
      that befor. Bi and bi, when thay was asleep and snoring, Jim sez:

      “U red about them wuns—u’ll see. Luuk at

      <i>him</i>. And luuk at Charles Second, and Louis Forteen, and
      Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Therd, and
      forty mor; besieds all them Saxon heptarchies that uezd to rip around so
      in oeld tiems and raez Cain. Mi, u aut to seen oeld Henry th
      Aet when he was in bloom. He <i>was</i> a blosom. He uezd
      to marry a nue wief evry day, and chop off her hed next morning. And
      he wuud do it just as indiferent as if he was ordering up egs. ‘Fech
      up Nell Gwynn,’ he sez. Thay fech her up. Next morning,
      ‘Chop off her hed!’ And thay chop it off. ‘Fech
      up Jane Shor,’ he sez; and up she cums, Next morning, ‘Chop
      off her hed’—and thay chop it off. ‘Ring up Fair
      Rosamun.’ Fair Rosamun ansers th bel. Next morning,
      ‘Chop off her hed.’ And he maed evry wun of them tel
      him a tael evry niet; and he kept that up til he had hogged a thouzand
      and wun taels that way, and then he puut them all in a buuk, and calld it
      Domesday Buuk—which was a guud naem and staeted th caes. U
      don’t noe kings, Jim, but I noe them; and this oeld rip of ourn is
      wun of th cleanest I’ve struk in history. Wel, Henry he
      taeks a noeshun he wonts to get up sum trubl with this cuntry. How duz
      he go at it—giv noetis?—giv th cuntry a sho? No.
      All of a suden he heevs all th tee in Boston Harbor oeverbord,
      and whacks out a declaraeshun of independens, and dairs them to cum on.
      That was <i>his</i> stiel—he never giv enybody a chans.
      He had suspishuns of his faather, th Duek of Wellington. Wel,
      whut did he do? Ask him to sho up? No—drownded him in a
      but of mamsey, liek a cat. S’poez peepl left muny laying
      around whair he was—whut did he do? He colard it. S’poez
      he contracted to do a thing, and u paed him, and didn’t set doun
      thair and see that he dun it—whut did he do? He allways dun
      th uther thing. S’poez he oepend his mouth—whut then? If
      he didn’t shut it up powerful qik he’d looz a lie evry
      tiem. That’s th kiend of a bug Henry was; and if we’d a
      had him along ’sted of our kings he’d a foold that toun a

      becauz thay ain’t, when u cum riet doun to th coeld facts; but
      thay ain’t nuthing to <i>that</i> oeld ram, enyway. All I say
      is, kings is kings, and u got to maek alowanses. Taek them all

      I went to sleep, and Jim didn’t call me when it was mi tern. He
      offen dun that. When I waekt up just at daybraek he was siting
      thair with his hed doun betwixt his nees, moaning and morning to
      himself. I didn’t taek noetis nor let on. I knowed whut
      it was about. He was thinking about his wief and his children, away
      up yonder, and he was lo and hoemsik; becauz he hadn’t ever bin
      away frum hoem befor in his lief; and I do beleev he caird just as much
      for his peepl as whiet foeks duz for thair’n. It don’t
      seem nacheral, but I rekon it’s so. He was offen moaning and
      morning that way niets, when he jujd I was asleep, and saying, “Po’ 
      litl ’Lizabeth! po’ litl Johnny! it’s miety hard; I
      spec’ I ain’t ever gwyne to see u no mo’, no mo’!”
      He was a miety guud nigger, Jim was.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this tiem I sumhow got to tauking to him about his wief and yung
      wuns; and bi and bi he sez:

      “Whut maeks me feel so bad dis tiem ’uz bekase I heer sumpn

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXIV.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, tords niet, we laed up under a litl wilo toehed out in
      th midl, whair thair was a vilej on eech sied of th river, and th
      duek and th king begun to lay out a plan for werking them touns. Jim
      he spoek to th duek, and sed he hoept it wouldn’t taek but a fue
      ours, becauz it got miety hevy and tiersum to him when he had to lay
      all day in th wigwom tied with th roep. U see, when we left him
      all aloen we had to tee him, becauz if enybody hapend on to him all bi
      himself and not tied it wouldn’t luuk much liek he was a runaway
      nigger, u noe. So th duek sed it <i>was</i> kiend of hard to hav to
      lay roept all day, and he’d siefer out sum way to get around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was uncomon briet, th duek was, and he soon struk it. He
      drest Jim up in King Lear’s outfit—it was a long
      curten-calico goun, and a whiet hors-hair wig and whiskers; and then he
      tuuk his theeater paent and paented Jim’s faes and hands and eers and
      nek all oever a ded, dul, solid bloo, liek a man that’s bin
      drownded nien days. Blaemd if he worn’t th horriblest luuking
      outraej I ever see. Then th duek tuuk and roet out a sien on a
      shinggl so:
    </p>
    <p>
      Sik Arab—but harmles when not out of his hed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he naeld that shinggl to a lath, and stuud th lath up foer or fiev
      fuut in frunt of th wigwom. Jim was satisfied. He sed it was
      a siet beter than lieing tied a cupl of yeers evry day, and trembling
      all oever evry tiem thair was a sound. Th duek toeld him to maek
      himself free and eezy, and if enybody ever cum medling around, he must
      hop out of th wigwom, and carry on a litl, and fech a houl or too liek
      a wield beest, and he rekond thay wuud liet out and leev him aloen.
      Which was sound enuf jujment; but u taek th averej man, and
      he wouldn’t waet for him to houl. Whi, he didn’t oenly
      luuk liek he was ded, he luukt considerabl mor than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thees rapscallions wonted to tri th Nonesuch agen, becauz thair was so
      much muny in it, but thay jujd it wouldn’t be saef, becauz maybe
      th nues miet a werkt along doun bi this tiem. Thay couldn’t
      hit no project that sooted exactly; so at last th duek sed he rekond
      he’d lay off and werk his braens an our or too and see if he couldn’t
      puut up sumthing on th Arkansaw vilej; and th king he alowd he wuud
      drop oever to t’uther vilej without eny plan, but just trust in
      Providens to leed him th profitabl way—meening th devil, I
      rekon. We had all baut stor cloeths whair we stopt last; and
      now th king puut his’n on, and he toeld me to puut mien on. I
      dun it, of cors. Th king’s duds was all blak, and he did
      luuk reeal swel and starchy. I never knowed how cloeths cuud chaenj
      a body befor. Whi, befor, he luukt liek th orneriest oeld rip
      that ever was; but now, when he’d taek off his nue whiet beever and
      maek a bo and do a smiel, he luukt that grand and guud and pieus that
      u’d say he had waukt riet out of th ark, and maybe was oeld
      Leviticus himself. Jim cleend up th canoo, and I got mi padl
      redy. Thair was a big steemboet laying at th shor away up under
      th point, about three miel abuv th toun—bin thair a cupl of
      ours, taeking on fraet. Sez th king:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Seein’ how I’m drest, I rekon maybe I beter ariev
      doun frum St. Louis or Cincinnati, or sum uther big plaes. Go for
      th steemboet, Huklberry; we’ll cum doun to th vilej on her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t hav to be orderd twies to go and taek a steemboet ried.
      I fetched th shor a haf a miel abuv th vilej, and then went
      scooting along th bluf bank in th eezy wauter. Prity soon we cum
      to a nies inosent-luuking yung cuntry jake seting on a log swobing
      th swet off of his faes, for it was powerful worm wether; and he had a
      cupl of big carpet-bags bi him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Run her noez in shor,” sez th king. I dun it.
      “Wher’ u bound for, yung man?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For th steemboet; going to Orleans.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Git abord,” sez th king. “Hoeld on a minit, mi
      servant ’ll he’p u with them bags. Jump out and he’p
      th jentlman, Adolphus”—meening me, I see.

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I dun so, and then we all three started on agen. Th yung chap
      was miety thankful; sed it was tuf werk toeting his bagej such
      wether. He askt th king whair he was going, and th king toeld him he’d
      cum doun th river and landed at th uther vilej this morning, and now
      he was going up a fue miel to see an oeld frend on a farm up thair. Th
      yung felo sez:

      “When I ferst see u I sez to mieself, ‘It’s Mr. Wilks,
      shur, and he cum miety neer geting heer in tiem.’ But then
      I sez agen, ‘No, I rekon it ain’t him, or els he wouldn’t
      be padling up th river.’ U <i>ain’t</i> him, ar
      u?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, mi naem’s Blodgett—Elexander Blodgett—<i>Reverend</i>
      Elexander Blodgett, I s’poez I must say, as I’m wun o’ 
      th Lord’s pur servants. But stil I’m jist as aebl to
      be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arieving in tiem, all th saem, if he’s
      mist enything bi it—which I hoep he hasn’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, he don’t mis eny property bi it, becauz he’ll
      get that all riet; but he’s mist seeing his bruther Peeter die—which
      he mayn’t miend, noebody can tel as to that—but his bruther
      wuud a giv enything in this werld to see <i>him</i> befor he died;
      never taukt about nuthing els all thees three weeks; hadn’t seen
      him sinss thay was boys together—and hadn’t ever seen his
      bruther William at all—that’s th deef and dum wun—William
      ain’t mor than therty or therty-fiev. Peeter and George wer
      th oenly wuns that cum out heer; George was th marryd bruther; him and
      his wief boeth died last yeer. Harvey and William’s th oenly
      wuns that’s left now; and, as I was saying, thay haeven’t got

    </p>
    <p>
      “Did enybody send ’em werd?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, yes; a munth or too ago, when Peeter was ferst tuuk; becauz
      Peeter sed then that he sorter felt liek he worn’t going to get wel
      this tiem. U see, he was prity oeld, and George’s g’yirls
      was too yung to be much cumpany for him, exsept Mary Jane, th red-heded
      wun; and so he was kiender loensum after George and his wief died, and
      didn’t seem to cair much to liv. He moest desperetly wonted
      to see Harvey—and William, too, for that mater—becauz he was
      wun of them kiend that can’t bair to maek a wil. He left a
      leter behiend for Harvey, and sed he’d toeld in it whair his muny
      was hid, and how he wonted th rest of th property divieded up so George’s
      g’yirls wuud be all riet—for George didn’t leev

    <p>
      “O, he lievs in England—Sheffield—preeches thair—hasn’t

      besieds he mightn’t a got th leter at all, u noe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Too bad, too bad he couldn’t a livd to see his bruthers,
      pur soel. U going to Orleans, u say?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but that ain’t oenly a part of it. I’m going

      Wel, th oeld man went on asking qeschuns til he just fairly emptyd
      that yung felo. Blaemd if he didn’t inqier about evrybody
      and evrything in that blest toun, and all about th Wilkses; and about
      Peeter’s biznes—which was a tanner; and about George’s—which
      was a carpenter; and about Harvey’s—which was a dissentering
      minister; and so on, and so on. Then he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut did u wont to wauk all th way up to th steemboet for?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Becauz she’s a big Orleans boet, and I was afeard she mightn’t
      stop thair. When thay’re deep thay wun’t stop for a
      hael. A Cincinnati boet wil, but this is a St. Louis wun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was Peeter Wilks wel off?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, yes, prity wel off. He had houses and land, and it’s
      rekond he left three or foer thouzand in cash hid up som’ers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When did u say he died?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I didn’t say, but it was last niet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fueneral to-morro, liekly?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, ’bout th midl of th day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, it’s all terribl sad; but we’ve all got to go,
      wun tiem or anuther. So whut we wont to do is to be prepaird; then we’re
      all riet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, ser, it’s th best way. Maa uezd to allways say
      that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When we struk th boet she was about dun loeding, and prity soon she
      got off. Th king never sed nuthing about going abord, so I lost
      mi ried, after all. When th boet was gon th king maed me padl
      up anuther miel to a loensum plaes, and then he got ashor and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now husl bak, riet off, and fech th duek up heer, and th nue
      carpet-bags. And if he’s gon oever to t’uther sied, go
      oever thair and git him. And tel him to git himself up regardles.
      Shuv along, now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I see whut <i>he</i> was up to; but I never sed nuthing, of cors.
      When I got bak with th duek we hid th canoo, and then thay set
      doun on a log, and th king toeld him evrything, just liek th yung
      felo had sed it—evry last werd of it. And all th tiem he
      was a-doing it he tried to tauk liek an Englishman; and he dun it prity
      wel, too, for a slouch. I can’t imitaet him, and so I ain’t
      a-going to tri to; but he reealy dun it prity guud. Then he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “How ar u on th deef and dum, Bilgewater?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th duek sed, leev him aloen for that; sed he had playd a deef and
      dum person on th histronic bords. So then thay waeted for a
      steemboet.
    </p>
    <p>
      About th midl of th afternoon a cupl of litl boets cum along, but
      thay didn’t cum frum hi enuf up th river; but at last thair
      was a big wun, and thay haeld her. She sent out her yall, and we
      went abord, and she was frum Cincinnati; and when thay found we oenly
      wonted to go foer or fiev miel thay was booming mad, and gaev us a
      cussing, and sed thay wouldn’t land us. But th king was ca’m.
      He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “If jentlmen kin aford to pay a dolar a miel apees to be tuuk on
      and puut off in a yall, a steemboet kin aford to carry ’em, can’t
      it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      So thay soffend doun and sed it was all riet; and when we got to th
      vilej thay yawled us ashor. About too duzen men flokt doun when
      thay see th yall a-cuming, and when th king sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Kin eny of u jentlmen tel me wher’ Mr. Peeter Wilks lievs?”
      thay giv a glans at wun anuther, and noded thair heds, as much as to
      say, “Whut d’ I tel u?” Then wun of them sez,
      kiend of sofft and jentl:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m sorry ser, but th best we can do is to tel u whair he
      <i>did</i> liv yesterday eevning.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Suden as winking th ornery oeld cretur went an to smash, and fel up
      agenst th man, and puut his chin on his shoelder, and cried doun his
      bak, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas, alas, our pur bruther—gon, and we never got to see
      him; o, it’s too, too hard!”

    <p>
      Then he terns around, blubbering, and maeks a lot of idiotic siens to th
      duek on his hands, and blaemd if he didn’t drop a carpet-bag and
      bust out a-crieing. If thay worn’t th beatenest lot, them too
      frauds, that ever I struk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, th men gatherd around and simpathiezd with them, and sed all
      sorts of kiend things to them, and carryd thair carpet-bags up th hil
      for them, and let them leen on them and cri, and toeld th king all about
      his bruther’s last moements, and th king he toeld it all oever agen
      on his hands to th duek, and boeth of them tuuk on about that ded tanner
      liek thay’d lost th twelv disiepls. Wel, if ever I struk
      enything liek it, I’m a nigger. It was enuf to maek a body ashaemd

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXV.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th nues was all oever toun in too minits, and u cuud see th peepl
      tairing doun on th run frum evry which way, sum of them puuting on
      thair coets as thay cum. Prity soon we was in th midl of a
      croud, and th noiz of th tramping was liek a soeljer march. Th
      windoes and dooryards was fuul; and evry minit sumbody wuud say, oever
      a fens:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it <i>them</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      And sumbody troting along with th gang wuud anser bak and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      “U bet it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got to th hous th street in frunt of it was pakt, and th
      three gerls was standing in th dor. Mary Jane <i>was</i>
      red-heded, but that don’t maek no diferens, she was moest awful
      buetiful, and her faes and her ies was all lit up liek glory, she was so
      glad her unkls was cum. Th king he spred his arms, and Mary Jane she
      jumpt for them, and th hair-lip jumpt for th duek, and thair thay had
      it! Evrybody moest, leastways wimen, cried for joy to see them meet
      agen at last and hav such guud tiems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then th king he huncht th duek prievet—I see him do it—and
      then he luukt around and see th coffin, oever in th corner on too
      chairs; so then him and th duek, with a hand across eech uther’s
      shoelder, and t’uther hand to thair ies, waukt slo and solem
      oever thair, evrybody droping bak to giv them room, and all th tauk
      and noiz stoping, peepl saying “Sh!” and all th men taeking
      thair hats off and drooping thair heds, so u cuud a herd a pin fall.
      And when thay got thair thay bent oever and luukt in th coffin, and
      tuuk wun siet, and then thay bust out a-crieing so u cuud a herd them
      to Orleans, moest; and then thay puut thair arms around eech uther’s
      neks, and hung thair chins oever eech uther’s shoelders; and then
      for three minits, or maybe foer, I never see too men leek th way thay
      dun. And, miend u, evrybody was doing th saem; and th plaes was
      that damp I never see enything liek it. Then wun of them got on wun sied
      of th coffin, and t’uther on t’uther sied, and thay neeld
      doun and rested thair forheds on th coffin, and let on to pray all to
      themselvs. Wel, when it cum to that it werkt th croud liek u
      never see enything liek it, and evrybody broek doun and went to sobing
      riet out loud—th pur gerls, too; and evry wuuman, neerly, went up
      to th gerls, without saying a werd, and kist them, solem, on th
      forhed, and then puut thair hand on thair hed, and luukt up tords th
      skie, with th teers runing doun, and then busted out and went off sobing
      and swobing, and giv th next wuuman a sho. I never see enything
      so disgusting.

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c25-212" id="c25-212"></a><br> <br>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, bi and bi th king he gets up and cums forward a litl, and werks
      himself up and slobbers out a speech, all fuul of teers and flapdoodle
      about its being a sor trieal for him and his pur bruther to looz th
      dizeezd, and to mis seeing dizeezd aliev after th long jerny of foer
      thouzand miel, but it’s a trieal that’s sweetened and
      sanktified to us bi this deer simpathy and thees hoely teers, and so he
      thanks them out of his hart and out of his bruther’s hart, becauz
      out of thair mouths thay can’t, werds being too weak and coeld, and
      all that kiend of rot and slush, til it was just sikening; and then he
      blubbers out a pieus guudy-guudy Aamen, and terns himself loos and goes to
      crieing fit to bust.
    </p>
    <p>
      And th minit th werds wer out of his mouth sumbody oever in th croud
      struk up th doxolojer, and evrybody joind in with all thair miet, and
      it just wormd u up and maed u feel as guud as cherch leting out.
      Muezic is a guud thing; and after all that soel-buter and hogwosh I never
      see it freshen up things so, and sound so onest and buuly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then th king begins to werk his jaw agen, and sez how him and his
      neeses wuud be glad if a fue of th maen prinsipal frends of th family
      wuud taek super heer with them this eevning, and help set up with th
      ashes of th dizeezd; and sez if his pur bruther laying yonder cuud
      speek he noes hoo he wuud naem, for thay was naems that was verry deer to
      him, and menshund offen in his leters; and so he wil naem th saem, to
      wit, as foloes, vizz.:—Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deecon Lot Hovey, and
      Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bel, and Dr. Robinson,
      and thair wievs, and th wido Bartley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was doun to th end of th toun a-hunting
      together—that is, I meen th doctor was shiping a sik man to t’uther
      werld, and th preecher was pinting him riet. Lawyer Bel was away
      up to Louisville on biznes. But th rest was on hand, and so thay
      all cum and shuuk hands with th king and thankt him and taukt to him;
      and then thay shuuk hands with th duek and didn’t say nuthing, but
      just kept a-smieling and bobing thair heds liek a passel of sapheads
      whilst he maed all sorts of siens with his hands and sed “Goo-goo—goo-goo-goo”
      all th tiem, liek a baeby that can’t tauk.
    </p>
    <p>
      So th king he blattered along, and manejd to inqier about prity much
      evrybody and daug in toun, bi his naem, and menshund all sorts of litl
      things that hapend wun tiem or anuther in th toun, or to George’s
      family, or to Peeter. And he allways let on that Peeter roet him th
      things; but that was a lie: he got evry blest wun of them out of
      that yung flat-hed that we canoed up to th steemboet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mary Jane she fetched th leter her faather left behiend, and th king
      he red it out loud and cried oever it. It giv th dweling-hous
      and three thouzand dolars, goeld, to th gerls; and it giv th tanyard
      (which was doing a guud biznes), along with sum uther houses and land
      (werth about seven thouzand), and three thouzand dolars in goeld to Harvey
      and William, and toeld whair th six thouzand cash was hid doun selar.
      So thees too frauds sed thay’d go and fech it up, and hav
      evrything sqair and abuv-bord; and toeld me to cum with a candl.
      We shut th selar dor behiend us, and when thay found th bag thay
      spilt it out on th flor, and it was a luvly siet, all them
      yaller-boys. Mi, th way th king’s ies did shien! He
      slaps th duek on th shoelder and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, <i>this</i> ain’t buuly nor noth’n! O, no, I
      rekon not! Whi, <i>buuly</i>, it beets th Nonesuch, <i>don’t</i>
      it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th duek alowd it did. Thay pawed th yaller-boys, and sifted them
      thru thair finggers and let them jinggl doun on th flor; and th king
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It ain’t no ues talkin’; bein’ bruthers to a rich
      ded man and representatives of furrin errs that’s got left is th
      lien for u and me, Bilj. Thish yer cums of trust’n to
      Providens. It’s th best way, in th long run. I’ve
      tried ’em all, and ther’ ain’t no beter way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Moest evrybody wuud a bin satisfied with th piel, and tuuk it on trust;
      but no, thay must count it. So thay counts it, and it cums out foer
      hundred and fifteen dolars short. Sez th king:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dern him, I wunder whut he dun with that foer hundred and fifteen
      dolars?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay weryd oever that awhiel, and ransakt all around for it. Then
      th duek sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, he was a prity sik man, and liekly he maed a mistaek—I
      rekon that’s th way of it. Th best way’s to let it
      go, and keep stil about it. We can spair it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, shuks, yes, we can <i>spair</i> it. I don’t k’yer
      noth’n ’bout that—it’s th <i>count</i> I’m
      thinkin’ about. We wont to be awful sqair and oepen and
      abuv-bord heer, u noe. We wont to lug this h-yer muny up
      stairs and count it befor evrybody—then ther’ ain’t
      noth’n suspishus. But when th ded man sez ther’s six
      thous’n dolars, u noe, we don’t wont to—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoeld on,” sez th duek. “Le’s maek up th
      deffisit,” and he begun to hall out yaller-boys out of his poket.

      “It’s a moest amaz’n’ guud iedeea, duek—u <i>hav</i>
      got a rattlin’ clever hed on u,” sez th king. “Blest
      if th oeld Nonesuch ain’t a heppin’ us out agin,” and <i>he</i>
      begun to hall out yaller-jakets and stak them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      It moest busted them, but thay maed up th six thouzand cleen and cleer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say,” sez th duek, “I got anuther iedeea. Le’s
      go up stairs and count this muny, and then taek and <i>giv it to th
      gerls</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guud land, duek, lemme hug u! It’s th moest dazling
      iedeea ’at ever a man struk. U hav cert’nly got th
      moest astonishin’ hed I ever see. O, this is th boss doj, ther’ 
      ain’t no mistaek ’bout it. Let ’em fech along
      thair suspishuns now if thay wont to—this ’ll lay ’em
      out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got up-stairs evrybody gethered around th taebl, and th king he
      counted it and stakt it up, three hundred dolars in a piel—twenty
      elegant litl piels. Evrybody luukt hunggry at it, and likt
      thair chops. Then thay raekt it into th bag agen, and I see th
      king begin to swel himself up for anuther speech. He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Frends all, mi pur bruther that lays yonder has dun jenerus bi
      them that’s left behiend in th vael of sorrers. He has dun
      jenerus bi thees yer pur litl lams that he luvd and shelterd, and
      that’s left faatherles and mutherles. Yes, and we that knowed
      him noes that he wuud a dun <i>mor</i> jenerus bi ’em if he
      hadn’t ben afeard o’ woundin’ his deer William and me.
      Now, <i>wouldn’t</i> he? Ther’ ain’t no
      qeschun ’bout it in <i>mi</i> miend. Wel, then, whut kiend o’ 
      bruthers wuud it be that ’d stand in his way at sech a tiem? And
      whut kiend o’ unkls wuud it be that ’d rob—yes, <i>rob</i>—sech
      pur sweet lams as thees ’at he luvd so at sech a tiem? If I
      noe William—and I <i>think</i> I do—he—wel, I’ll
      jest ask him.” He terns around and begins to maek a lot of siens to
      th duek with his hands, and th duek he luuks at him stoopid and
      lether-heded a whiel; then all of a suden he seems to cach his
      meening, and jumps for th king, goo-gooing with all his miet for joy,
      and hugs him about fifteen tiems befor he lets up. Then th king
      sez, “I knowed it; I rekon <i>that ’ll</i> convins enybody
      th way <i>he</i> feels about it. Heer, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner,
      taek th muny—taek it <i>all</i>. It’s th gift of him
      that lays yonder, coeld but joyful.”

      Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and th hair-lip went for th duek, and
      then such anuther huging and kising I never see yet. And evrybody
      crouded up with th teers in thair ies, and moest shuuk th hands off of
      them frauds, saying all th tiem:
    </p>
    <p>
      “U <i>deer</i> guud soels!—how <i>luvly</i>!—how <i>cuud</i>
      u!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, then, prity soon all hands got to tauking about th dizeezd agen,
      and how guud he was, and whut a loss he was, and all that; and befor long
      a big ieern-jawed man werkt himself in thair frum outsied, and stuud
      a-lisening and luuking, and not saying enything; and noebody saying
      enything to him eether, becauz th king was tauking and thay was all bizy
      lisening. Th king was saying—in th midl of sumthing he’d
      started in on—
    </p>
    <p>
      “—thay bein’ partickler frends o’ th dizeezd.
      That’s whi thay’re invieted heer this evenin’; but
      tomorro we wont <i>all</i> to cum—evrybody; for he respected
      evrybody, he liekt evrybody, and so it’s fitten that his fueneral
      orjys sh’d be public.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he went a-mooning on and on, lieking to heer himself tauk, and evry
      litl whiel he fetched in his fueneral orjys agen, til th duek he
      couldn’t stand it no mor; so he riets on a litl scrap of paeper,
      “<i>Obseqys</i>, u oeld fool,” and foelds it up, and goes to
      goo-gooing and reeching it oever peepl’s heds to him. Th
      king he reeds it and puuts it in his poket, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pur William, aflicted as he is, his <i>hart’s</i> aluz
      riet. Asks me to inviet evrybody to cum to th fueneral—wonts
      me to maek ’em all welcum. But he needn’t a weryd—it
      was jest whut I was at.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he weevs along agen, perfectly ca’m, and goes to droping in
      his fueneral orjys agen evry now and then, just liek he dun befor.
      And when he dun it th therd tiem he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I say orjys, not becauz it’s th comon term, becauz it
      ain’t—obseqys bein’ th comon term—but becauz
      orjys is th riet term. Obseqys ain’t uezd in England no mor
      now—it’s gon out. We say orjys now in England. Orjys
      is beter, becauz it meens th thing u’re after mor exact.
      It’s a werd that’s maed up out’n th Greek <i>orgo</i>,
      outsied, oepen, abraud; and th Hebrew <i>jeesum</i>, to plant, cuver up;
      hens in<i>ter.</i> So, u see, fueneral orjys is an oepen er public
      fueneral.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He was th <i>werst</i> I ever struk. Wel, th ieern-jawed man he
      laft riet in his faes. Evrybody was shokt. Evrybody
      sez, “Whi, <i>doctor</i>!” and Abner Shackleford sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Robinson, hain’t u herd th nues? This is
      Harvey Wilks.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th king he smield eeger, and shuvd out his flaper, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it mi pur bruther’s deer guud frend and fizishan?
      I—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Keep yur hands off of me!” sez th doctor. “<i>U</i>
      tauk liek an Englishman, <i>don’t</i> u? It’s th
      werst imitaeshun I ever herd. <i>U</i> Peeter Wilks’s
      bruther! U’re a fraud, that’s whut u ar!”
    </p>

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, how thay all tuuk on! Thay crouded around th doctor and tried
      to qieet him doun, and tried to explaen to him and tel him how Harvey
      ’d shoed in forty ways that he <i>was</i> Harvey, and knowed
      evrybody bi naem, and th naems of th verry daugs, and begd and <i>begd</i>
      him not to hert Harvey’s feelings and th pur gerl’s
      feelings, and all that. But it worn’t no ues; he stormd riet
      along, and sed eny man that pretended to be an Englishman and couldn’t
      imitaet th linggo no beter than whut he did was a fraud and a lieer.
      Th pur gerls was hanging to th king and crieing; and all of a
      suden th doctor ups and terns on <i>them</i>. He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was yur faather’s frend, and I’m yur frend; and I
      worn u as a frend, and an onest wun that wonts to protect u and keep
      u out of harm and trubl, to tern yur baks on that scoundrel and hav
      nuthing to do with him, th ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and
      Hebrew, as he calls it. He is th thinnest kiend of an impostor—has
      cum heer with a lot of empty naems and facts which he pikt up
      somewheres, and u taek them for <i>proofs</i>, and ar helpt to fool
      yurselvs bi thees foolish frends heer, hoo aut to noe beter. Mary
      Jane Wilks, u noe me for yur frend, and for yur unselfish frend,
      too. Now lisen to me; tern this pityful rascal out—I <i>beg</i>
      u to do it. Wil u?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Jane straetend herself up, and mi, but she was hansum! She
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Heer</i> is mi anser.” She hoev up th bag of muny
      and puut it in th king’s hands, and sez, “Taek this six
      thouzand dolars, and invest for me and mi sisters eny way u wont to,
      and don’t giv us no reseet for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she puut her arm around th king on wun sied, and Susan and th
      hair-lip dun th saem on th uther. Evrybody clapt thair hands
      and stompt on th flor liek a perfect storm, whilst th king held up his
      hed and smield proud. Th doctor sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet; I wosh <i>mi</i> hands of th mater. But I worn
      u all that a tiem ’s cuming when u’re going to feel sik
      whenever u think of this day.” And away he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet, doctor,” sez th king, kiender moking him;
      “we’ll tri and get ’em to send for u;” which
      maed them all laf, and thay sed it was a priem guud hit.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXVI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, when thay was all gon th king he asks Mary Jane how thay was off
      for spair rooms, and she sed she had wun spair room, which wuud do for
      Unkl William, and she’d giv her oen room to Unkl Harvey, which
      was a litl biger, and she wuud tern into th room with her sisters and
      sleep on a cot; and up garret was a litl cubby, with a palet in it. Th
      king sed th cubby wuud do for his valy—meening me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mary Jane tuuk us up, and she shoed them thair rooms, which was plaen
      but nies. She sed she’d hav her froks and a lot of uther
      traps tuuk out of her room if thay was in Unkl Harvey’s way, but he
      sed thay worn’t. Th froks was hung along th wall, and
      befor them was a curten maed out of calico that hung doun to th flor.
      Thair was an oeld hair trunk in wun corner, and a gitar-box in
      anuther, and all sorts of litl knickknacks and jimcracks around, liek
      gerls brisken up a room with. Th king sed it was all th mor
      hoemly and mor pleasanter for thees fixings, and so don’t disterb
      them. Th duek’s room was prity small, but plenty guud
      enuf, and so was mi cubby.
    </p>
    <p>
      That niet thay had a big super, and all them men and wimen was thair,
      and I stuud behiend th king and th duek’s chairs and waeted on
      them, and th niggers waeted on th rest. Mary Jane she set at th
      hed of th taebl, with Susan alongsied of her, and sed how bad th
      biskits was, and how meen th prezervs was, and how ornery and tuf th
      fried chikens was—and all that kiend of rot, th way wimen allways do
      for to fors out compliments; and th peepl all knowed evrything was
      tiptop, and sed so—sed “How <i>do</i> u get biskits to
      broun so nies?” and “Whair, for th land’s saek, <i>did</i>
      u get thees amaz’n pikls?” and all that kiend of humbug
      tauky-tauk, just th way peepl allways duz at a super, u noe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c26-221" id="c26-221"></a><br> <br>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      And when it was all dun me and th hair-lip had super in th kichen off
      of th leevings, whilst th uthers was helping th niggers cleen up th
      things. Th hair-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest
      if I didn’t think th ies was geting miety thin sumtiems. She
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did u ever see th king?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoo? William Foerth? Wel, I bet I hav—he goes
      to our cherch.” I knowed he was ded yeers ago, but I never
      let on. So when I sez he goes to our cherch, she sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut—reguelar?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes—reguelar. His pue’s riet oever opozit ourn—on
      t’uther sied th puulpit.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thaut he livd in London?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, he duz. Whair <i>wuud</i> he liv?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I thaut <i>u</i> livd in Sheffield?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I see I was up a stump. I had to let on to get choekt with a chiken
      boen, so as to get tiem to think how to get doun agen. Then I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I meen he goes to our cherch reguelar when he’s in Sheffield.
      That’s oenly in th sumer tiem, when he cums thair to taek
      th see baths.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, how u tauk—Sheffield ain’t on th see.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, hoo sed it was?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, u did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I <i>didn’t</i> nuther.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U did!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I didn’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I never sed nuthing of th kiend.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, whut <i>did</i> u say, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sed he cum to taek th see <i>baths</i>—that’s whut I
      sed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, how’s he going to taek th see baths if it ain’t
      on th see?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Luuky heer,” I sez; “did u ever see eny
      Conggres-wauter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, did u hav to go to Conggres to get it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, no.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, neether duz William Foerth hav to go to th see to get a
      see bath.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How duz he get it, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gets it th way peepl doun heer gets Conggres-wauter—in
      barrels. Thair in th palas at Sheffield thay’ve got
      fernises, and he wonts his wauter hot. Thay can’t biel that
      amount of wauter away off thair at th see. Thay haeven’t got no
      conveenyunses for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, I see, now. U miet a sed that in th ferst plaes and
      saevd tiem.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When she sed that I see I was out of th wuuds agen, and so I was
      cumfortabl and glad. Next, she sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do u go to cherch, too?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes—reguelar.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whair do u set?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, in our pue.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Hoos</i> pue?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, <i>ourn</i>—yur Unkl Harvey’s.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His’n? Whut duz <i>he</i> wont with a pue?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wonts it to set in. Whut did u <i>rekon</i> he wonted with
      it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, I thaut he’d be in th puulpit.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Rot him, I forgot he was a preecher. I see I was up a stump agen,
      so I playd anuther chiken boen and got anuther think. Then I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Blaem it, do u supoez thair ain’t but wun preecher to a
      cherch?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, whut do thay wont with mor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut!—to preech befor a king? I never did see such a
      gerl as u. Thay don’t hav no les than seventeen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Seventeen! Mi land! Whi, I wouldn’t set out such
      a string as that, not if I <i>never</i> got to glory. It must taek
      ’em a week.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shuks, thay don’t <i>all</i> of ’em preech th saem
      day—oenly <i>wun</i> of ’em.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, whut duz th rest of ’em do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, nuthing much. Lol around, pas th plaet—and wun
      thing or anuther. But maenly thay don’t do nuthing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, whut ar thay <i>for</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, thay’re for <i>stiel</i>. Don’t u noe
      nuthing?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I don’t <i>wont</i> to noe no such foolishnes as
      that. How is servants treeted in England? Do thay treet
      ’em beter ’n we treet our niggers?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>No</i>! A servant ain’t noebody thair. Thay
      treet them wers than daugs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t thay giv ’em holidays, th way we do, Christmas
      and Nue Yeer’s week, and Foerth of July?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, just lisen! A body cuud tel <i>u</i> hain’t
      ever bin to England bi that. Whi, Hair-l—whi, Joanna, thay
      never see a holiday frum yeer’s end to yeer’s end; never go to
      th sercus, nor theeater, nor nigger shoes, nor nowheres.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nor cherch?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nor cherch.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But <i>u</i> allways went to cherch.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, I was gon up agen. I forgot I was th oeld man’s
      servant. But next minit I wherld in on a kiend of an explanaeshun
      how a valy was diferent frum a comon servant and <i>had</i> to go to
      cherch whether he wonted to or not, and set with th family, on acount of
      its being th law. But I didn’t do it prity guud, and when I
      got dun I see she worn’t satisfied. She sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Onest injun, now, hain’t u bin teling me a lot of lies?”
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      “Onest injun,” sez I.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nun of it at all?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nun of it at all. Not a lie in it,” sez I.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lay yur hand on this buuk and say it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I see it worn’t nuthing but a dicshunairy, so I laed mi hand on it
      and sed it. So then she luukt a litl beter satisfied, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, I’ll beleev sum of it; but I hoep to graeshus
      if I’ll beleev th rest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut is it u wun’t beleev, Joe?” sez Mary Jane,
      steping in with Susan behiend her. “It ain’t riet nor kiend
      for u to tauk so to him, and him a straenjer and so far frum his peepl.
      How wuud u liek to be treeted so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s allways yur way, Maim—allways saeling in to help
      sumbody befor thay’re hert. I hain’t dun nuthing to
      him. He’s toeld sum stretchers, I rekon, and I sed I wouldn’t
      swolo it all; and that’s evry bit and graen I <i>did</i> say.
      I rekon he can stand a litl thing liek that, can’t he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t cair whether ’twas litl or whether ’twas
      big; he’s heer in our hous and a straenjer, and it wasn’t guud
      of u to say it. If u was in his plaes it wuud maek u feel
      ashaemd; and so u oughtn’t to say a thing to anuther person that
      wil maek <i>them</i> feel ashaemd.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Mam, he sed—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It don’t maek no diferens whut he <i>sed</i>—that
      ain’t th thing. Th thing is for u to treet him <i>kiend</i>,
      and not be saying things to maek him remember he ain’t in his oen
      cuntry and amungst his oen foeks.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sez to mieself, <i>this</i> is a gerl that I’m leting that oeld
      reptiel rob her of her muny!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Susan <i>she</i> waltzed in; and if u’ll beleev me, she did
      giv Hair-lip hark frum th toom!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sez I to mieself, and this is <i>anuther</i> wun that I’m leting
      him rob her of her muny!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mary Jane she tuuk anuther ining, and went in sweet and luvly agen—which
      was her way; but when she got dun thair worn’t hardly enything left
      o’ pur Hair-lip. So she holerd.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet, then,” sez th uther gerls; “u just ask
      his pardon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She dun it, too; and she dun it buetiful. She dun it so
      buetiful it was guud to heer; and I wisht I cuud tel her a thouzand
      lies, so she cuud do it agen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sez to mieself, this is <i>anuther</i> wun that I’m leting him
      rob her of her muny. And when she got thru thay all jest laed
      theirselves out to maek me feel at hoem and noe I was amungst frends.
      I felt so ornery and lo doun and meen that I sez to mieself, mi
      miend’s maed up; I’ll hiev that muny for them or bust.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then I lit out—for bed, I sed, meening sum tiem or anuther.
      When I got bi mieself I went to thinking th thing oever. I sez
      to mieself, shal I go to that doctor, prievet, and blo on thees frauds?
      No—that wun’t do. He miet tel hoo toeld him; then th
      king and th duek wuud maek it worm for me. Shal I go, prievet,
      and tel Mary Jane? No—I dasn’t do it. Her faes wuud
      giv them a hint, shur; thay’ve got th muny, and thay’d
      slied riet out and get away with it. If she was to fech in help I’d
      get mixt up in th biznes befor it was dun with, I juj. No;
      thair ain’t no guud way but wun. I got to steel that muny,
      sumhow; and I got to steel it sum way that thay wun’t suspishun
      that I dun it. Thay’ve got a guud thing heer, and thay ain’t
      a-going to leev til thay’ve playd this family and this toun for
      all thay’re werth, so I’ll fiend a chans tiem enuf. I’ll
      steel it and hied it; and bi and bi, when I’m away doun th river, I’ll
      riet a leter and tel Mary Jane whair it’s hid. But I beter
      hiev it toniet if I can, becauz th doctor maybe hasn’t let up as
      much as he lets on he has; he miet scair them out of heer yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, thinks I, I’ll go and serch them rooms. Upstairs th hall
      was dark, but I found th duek’s room, and started to paw around it
      with mi hands; but I recolected it wouldn’t be much liek th king
      to let enybody els taek cair of that muny but his oen self; so then I
      went to his room and begun to paw around thair. But I see I couldn’t
      do nuthing without a candl, and I dasn’t liet wun, of cors.
      So I jujd I’d got to do th uther thing—lay for them
      and eevzdrop. About that tiem I heers thair fuutsteps cuming, and
      was going to skip under th bed; I reecht for it, but it wasn’t
      whair I thaut it wuud be; but I tucht th curten that hid Mary Jane’s
      froks, so I jumpt in behiend that and snugld in amungst th gouns, and
      stuud thair perfectly stil.

      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay cum in and shut th dor; and th ferst thing th duek dun was to
      get doun and luuk under th bed. Then I was glad I hadn’t
      found th bed when I wonted it. And yet, u noe, it’s kiend
      of nacheral to hied under th bed when u ar up to enything prievet.
      Thay sets doun then, and th king sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, whut is it? And cut it middlin’ short, becauz it’s
      beter for us to be doun thair a-whoopin’ up th mournin’ than
      up heer givin’ ’em a chans to tauk us oever.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, this is it, Capet. I ain’t eezy; I ain’t
      cumfortabl. That doctor lays on mi miend. I wonted to noe
      yur plans. I’ve got a noeshun, and I think it’s a sound
      wun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut is it, duek?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That we beter glied out of this befor three in th morning, and
      clip it doun th river with whut we’ve got. Speshaly, seeing
      we got it so eezy—<i>given</i> bak to us, flung at our heds, as
      u may say, when of cors we alowd to hav to steel it bak. I’m
      for noking off and lieting out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      That maed me feel prity bad. About an our or too ago it wuud a
      bin a litl diferent, but now it maed me feel bad and disapointed, Th
      king rips out and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut! And not sel out th rest o’ th property? March
      off liek a passel of fools and leev aet or nien thous’n’ 
      dolars’ werth o’ property layin’ around jest sufferin’ 
      to be scoopt in?—and all guud, saelabl stuf, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th duek he grumbld; sed th bag of goeld was enuf, and he didn’t
      wont to go no deeper—didn’t wont to rob a lot of orfans of <i>evrything</i>
      thay had.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, how u tauk!” sez th king. “We sha’n’t
      rob ’em of nuthing at all but jest this muny. Th peepl that
      <i>bies</i> th property is th suff’rers; becauz as soon ’s
      it’s found out ’at we didn’t oen it—which wun’t
      be long after we’ve slid—th sael wun’t be valid, and it
      ’ll all go bak to th estaet. Thees yer orfans ’ll git
      thair hous bak agin, and that’s enuf for <i>them</i>; thay’re
      yung and spri, and k’n eezy ern a livin’. <i>thay</i>
      ain’t a-goin to sufer. Whi, jest think—thair’s
      thous’n’s and thous’n’s that ain’t ni so
      wel off. Bles u, <i>thay</i> ain’t got noth’n’ 
      to complaen of.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, th king he taukt him bliend; so at last he giv in, and sed all
      riet, but sed he beleevd it was blaemd foolishnes to stay, and that
      doctor hanging oever them. But th king sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cuss th doctor! Whut do we k’yer for <i>him</i>?
      Hain’t we got all th fools in toun on our sied? And ain’t
      that a big enuf majority in eny toun?”
    </p>
    <p>
      So thay got redy to go doun stairs agen. Th duek sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t think we puut that muny in a guud plaes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      That cheerd me up. I’d begun to think I worn’t going to
      get a hint of no kiend to help me. Th king sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Becauz Mary Jane ’ll be in morning frum this out; and ferst
      u noe th nigger that duz up th rooms wil get an order to box thees
      duds up and puut ’em away; and do u rekon a nigger can run across
      muny and not borro sum of it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yur hed’s level agin, duek,” sez th king; and he
      cums a-fumbling under th curten too or three fuut frum whair I was.
      I stuk tiet to th wall and kept miety stil, tho quivery; and
      I wunderd whut them feloes wuud say to me if thay catched me; and I
      tried to think whut I’d beter do if thay did cach me. But
      th king he got th bag befor I cuud think mor than about a haf a
      thaut, and he never suspicioned I was around. Thay tuuk and shuvd
      th bag thru a rip in th straw tik that was under th fether-bed,
      and cramd it in a fuut or too amungst th straw and sed it was all
      riet now, becauz a nigger oenly maeks up th fether-bed, and don’t
      tern oever th straw tik oenly about twies a yeer, and so it worn’t
      in no daenjer of geting stoel now.

    <p>
      But I knowed beter. I had it out of thair befor thay was haf-way
      doun stairs. I groept along up to mi cubby, and hid it thair til I
      cuud get a chans to do beter. I jujd I beter hied it outsied
      of th hous somewheres, becauz if thay mist it thay wuud giv th
      hous a guud ransaking: I knowed that verry wel. Then I
      ternd in, with mi cloeths all on; but I couldn’t a gon to sleep if
      I’d a wonted to, I was in such a swet to get thru with th
      biznes. Bi and bi I herd th king and th duek cum up; so I
      roeld off mi palet and laed with mi chin at th top of mi lader, and
      waeted to see if enything was going to hapen. But nuthing did.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I held on til all th laet sounds had qit and th erly wuns hadn’t
      begun yet; and then I slipt doun th lader.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXVII.
    </p>
    <p>
      I crept to thair dors and lisend; thay was snoring. So I tiptoed
      along, and got doun stairs all riet. Thair worn’t a sound
      anywheres. I peeped thru a crak of th diening-room dor, and see
      th men that was woching th corps all sound asleep on thair chairs.
      Th dor was oepen into th parlor, whair th corps was laying, and
      thair was a candl in boeth rooms. I past along, and th parlor dor was
      oepen; but I see thair worn’t noebody in thair but th remainders of
      Peeter; so I shuvd on bi; but th frunt dor was lokt, and th kee wasn’t
      thair. Just then I herd sumbody cuming doun th stairs, bak
      behiend me. I run in th parlor and tuuk a swift luuk around, and th
      oenly plaes I see to hied th bag was in th coffin. Th lid was
      shuvd along about a fuut, shoeing th ded man’s faes doun in
      thair, with a wet clauth oever it, and his shroud on. I tukt th
      muny-bag in under th lid, just doun beyond whair his hands was crosst,
      which maed me creep, thay was so coeld, and then I run bak across th room
      and in behiend th dor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th person cuming was Mary Jane. She went to th coffin, verry sofft,
      and neeld doun and luukt in; then she puut up her hankerchif, and I
      see she begun to cri, tho I couldn’t heer her, and her bak was
      to me. I slid out, and as I past th diening-room I thaut I’d
      maek shur them wochers hadn’t seen me; so I luukt thru th
      crak, and evrything was all riet. Thay hadn’t sterd.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slipt up to bed, feeling ruther bloo, on acounts of th thing playing
      out that way after I had tuuk so much trubl and run so much resk about
      it. Sez I, if it cuud stay whair it is, all riet; becauz when we
      get doun th river a hundred miel or too I cuud riet bak to Mary Jane,
      and she cuud dig him up agen and get it; but that ain’t th thing
      that’s going to hapen; th thing that’s going to hapen is,
      th muny ’ll be found when thay cum to scroo on th lid. Then
      th king ’ll get it agen, and it ’ll be a long day befor he
      givs enybody anuther chans to smouch it frum him. Of cors I <i>wonted</i>
      to slied doun and get it out of thair, but I dasn’t tri it. Evry
      minit it was geting erlyer now, and prity soon sum of them wochers
      wuud begin to ster, and I miet get catched—catched with six
      thouzand dolars in mi hands that noebody hadn’t hierd me to taek
      cair of. I don’t wish to be mixt up in no such biznes as
      that, I sez to mieself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got doun stairs in th morning th parlor was shut up, and th
      wochers was gon. Thair worn’t noebody around but th family
      and th wido Bartley and our trieb. I wocht thair faeses to see if
      enything had bin hapening, but I couldn’t tel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tords th midl of th day th undertaeker cum with his man, and thay
      set th coffin in th midl of th room on a cupl of chairs, and then
      set all our chairs in roes, and borroed mor frum th naebors til th
      hall and th parlor and th diening-room was fuul. I see th coffin
      lid was th way it was befor, but I dasn’t go to luuk in under it,
      with foeks around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then th peepl begun to flok in, and th beets and th gerls tuuk seets
      in th frunt ro at th hed of th coffin, and for a haf an our th
      peepl field around slo, in singgl rank, and luukt doun at th ded man’s
      faes a minit, and sum dropt in a teer, and it was all verry stil and
      solem, oenly th gerls and th beets hoelding hankerchifs to thair ies
      and keeping thair heds bent, and sobing a litl. Thair worn’t
      no uther sound but th scraeping of th feet on th flor and bloeing noezes—becauz
      peepl allways bloes them mor at a fueneral than thay do at uther plaeses
      exsept cherch.
    </p>
    <p>
      When th plaes was pakt fuul th undertaeker he slid around in his blak
      gluvs with his softy soothering ways, puuting on th last tuches, and
      geting peepl and things all ship-shaep and cumfortabl, and maeking no
      mor sound than a cat. He never spoek; he moovd peepl around, he
      sqeezd in laet wuns, he oepend up pasejways, and dun it with nods,
      and siens with his hands. Then he tuuk his plaes oever agenst th
      wall. He was th sofftest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and
      thair worn’t no mor smiel to him than thair is to a ham.

      Thay had borroed a melodeum—a sik wun; and when evrything was
      redy a yung wuuman set doun and werkt it, and it was prity skreeky and
      coliky, and evrybody joind in and sung, and Peeter was th oenly wun that
      had a guud thing, acording to mi noeshun. Then th Reverend Hobson
      oepend up, slo and solem, and begun to tauk; and straet off th moest
      outraejus ro busted out in th selar a body ever herd; it was oenly wun
      daug, but he maed a moest powerful raket, and he kept it up riet along;
      th parson he had to stand thair, oever th coffin, and waet—u
      couldn’t heer yurself think. It was riet doun aukward, and
      noebody didn’t seem to noe whut to do. But prity soon thay
      see that long-legd undertaeker maek a sien to th preecher as much as to
      say, “Don’t u wery—just depend on me.” Then
      he stoopt doun and begun to glied along th wall, just his shoelders
      shoeing oever th peepl’s heds. So he glieded along, and th
      powwow and raket geting mor and mor outraejus all th tiem; and at
      last, when he had gon around too sieds of th room, he disapeers doun
      selar. Then in about too seconds we herd a whak, and th daug he
      finisht up with a moest amaezing houl or too, and then evrything was ded
      stil, and th parson begun his solem tauk whair he left off. In a
      minit or too heer cums this undertaeker’s bak and shoelders
      gliding along th wall agen; and so he glieded and glieded around three
      sieds of th room, and then roez up, and shaeded his mouth with his hands,
      and strecht his nek out tords th preecher, oever th peepl’s
      heds, and sez, in a kiend of a cors whisper, “<i>He had a rat</i>!”
      Then he droopt doun and glieded along th wall agen to his plaes.
      U cuud see it was a graet satisfacshun to th peepl, becauz
      nacheraly thay wonted to noe. A litl thing liek that don’t
      cost nuthing, and it’s just th litl things that maeks a man to be
      luukt up to and liekt. Thair worn’t no mor popuelar man in
      toun than whut that undertaeker was.

      Wel, th fueneral sermon was verry guud, but pison long and tiersum; and
      then th king he shuvd in and got off sum of his uezhual rubbage, and at
      last th job was thru, and th undertaeker begun to sneek up on th
      coffin with his scroo-driever. I was in a swet then, and wocht him
      prity keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid th lid along as sofft
      as mush, and scrood it doun tiet and fast. So thair I was! I
      didn’t noe whether th muny was in thair or not. So, sez I,
      s’poez sumbody has hogged that bag on th sli?—now how do I
      noe whether to riet to Mary Jane or not? S’poez she dug him up and
      didn’t fiend nuthing, whut wuud she think of me? Blaem it, I sez, I
      miet get hunted up and jaeld; I’d beter lay lo and keep dark,
      and not riet at all; th thing’s awful mixt now; trieing to beter
      it, I’ve wersend it a hundred tiems, and I wish to guudnes I’d
      just let it aloen, dad fech th hoel biznes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay berryd him, and we cum bak hoem, and I went to woching faeses agen—I
      couldn’t help it, and I couldn’t rest eezy. But nuthing
      cum of it; th faeses didn’t tel me nuthing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th king he vizited around in th eevning, and sweetened evrybody up, and
      maed himself ever so frendly; and he giv out th iedeea that his
      conggregaeshun oever in England wuud be in a swet about him, so he must
      hery and setl up th estaet riet away and leev for hoem. He was
      verry sorry he was so puusht, and so was evrybody; thay wisht he cuud
      stay longger, but thay sed thay cuud see it couldn’t be dun.
      And he sed of cors him and William wuud taek th gerls hoem with
      them; and that pleezd evrybody too, becauz then th gerls wuud be wel
      fixt and amungst thair oen relaeshuns; and it pleezd th gerls, too—tikld
      them so thay cleen forgot thay ever had a trubl in th werld; and toeld
      him to sel out as qik as he wonted to, thay wuud be redy. Them
      pur things was that glad and hapy it maed mi hart aek to see them
      geting foold and lied to so, but I didn’t see no saef way for me
      to chip in and chaenj th jeneral tuen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, blaemd if th king didn’t bil th hous and th niggers and
      all th property for aucshun straet off—sael too days after th
      fueneral; but enybody cuud bi prievet beforhand if thay wonted to.
    </p>
    <p>
      So th next day after th fueneral, along about noon-tiem, th gerls’ 
      joy got th ferst joelt. A cupl of nigger traeders cum along, and
      th king soeld them th niggers reezonabl, for three-day drafts as thay
      calld it, and away thay went, th too suns up th river to Memphis, and
      thair muther doun th river to Orleans. I thaut them pur gerls
      and them niggers wuud braek thair harts for greef; thay cried around
      eech uther, and tuuk on so it moest maed me doun sik to see it. Th
      gerls sed thay hadn’t ever dreemd of seeing th family separaeted
      or soeld away frum th toun. I can’t ever get it out of mi
      memory, th siet of them pur mizerabl gerls and niggers hanging around
      eech uther’s neks and crieing; and I rekon I couldn’t a stuud
      it all, but wuud a had to bust out and tel on our gang if I hadn’t
      knowed th sael worn’t no acount and th niggers wuud be bak hoem
      in a week or too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th thing maed a big ster in th toun, too, and a guud meny cum out
      flatfuuted and sed it was scandalus to separaet th muther and th
      children that way. It injerd th frauds sum; but th oeld fool he
      bulled riet along, spiet of all th duek cuud say or do, and I tel u
      th duek was powerful uneezy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day was aucshun day. About braud day in th morning th king
      and th duek cum up in th garret and woek me up, and I see bi thair luuk
      that thair was trubl. Th king sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was u in mi room niet befor last?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, yur majesty”—which was th way I allways calld him
      when noebody but our gang worn’t around.

      I studyd awhiel and see mi chans; then I sez:

      “Wel, I see th niggers go in thair several tiems.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Boeth of them gaev a litl jump, and luukt liek thay hadn’t ever
      expected it, and then liek thay <i>had</i>. Then th duek sez:

    <p>
      “Whut, all of them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No—leastways, not all at wuns—that is, I don’t

    </p>
    <p>
      “Helo! When was that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was th day we had th fueneral. In th morning. It
      worn’t erly, becauz I oeverslept. I was just starting doun
      th lader, and I see them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, go on, <i>go</i> on! Whut did thay do? How’d
      thay act?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thay didn’t do nuthing. And thay didn’t act
      enyway much, as fer as I see. Thay tiptoed away; so I seen, eezy enuf,
      that thay’d shuvd in thair to do up yur majesty’s room, or
      sumthing, s’poezing u was up; and found u <i>worn’t</i>
      up, and so thay was hoeping to slied out of th way of trubl without
      waeking u up, if thay hadn’t allredy waekt u up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Graet guns, <i>this</i> is a go!” sez th king; and boeth of
      them luukt prity sik and tolerabl sily. Thay stuud thair
      a-thinking and scraching thair heds a minit, and th duek he bust into
      a kiend of a litl raspy chukl, and sez:

    <p>
      “It duz beet all how neet th niggers playd thair hand. Thay
      let on to be <i>sorry</i> thay was going out of this reejon! And I

      Don’t ever tel <i>me</i> eny mor that a nigger ain’t
      got eny histrionic talent. Whi, th way thay playd that thing it
      wuud fool <i>enybody</i>. In mi opinyon, thair’s a forchun in

    <p>
      “In th bank for to be colected. Whair <i>wuud</i> it be?”

    <p>
      “Wel, <i>that’s</i> all riet then, thank guudnes.”

      Th king wherls on me and rips out:

    <p>
      As thay was starting doun th lader th duek he chukls agen, and sez:

    <p>
      Th king sassed bak as much as was saef for him, and then swapped around

      acting that way—sed eny fool wuud a <i>knowed</i> sumthing was
      up. And then waltzed in and cussed <i>himself</i> awhiel, and sed
      it all cum of him not laying laet and taeking his nacheral rest that
      morning, and he’d be blaemd if he’d ever do it agen. So
      thay went off a-jawing; and I felt dredful glad I’d werkt it all
      off on to th niggers, and yet hadn’t dun th niggers no harm bi

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXVIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bi and bi it was geting-up tiem. So I cum doun th lader and
      started for doun-stairs; but as I cum to th gerls’ room th dor
      was oepen, and I see Mary Jane seting bi her oeld hair trunk, which was
      oepen and she’d bin paking things in it—geting redy to go
      to England. But she had stopt now with a foelded goun in her lap,
      and had her faes in her hands, crieing. I felt awful bad to see it;
      of cors enybody wuud. I went in thair and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mis Mary Jane, u can’t a-bair to see peepl in trubl,
      and I can’t—moest allways. Tel me about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So she dun it. And it was th niggers—I just expected it.
      She sed th buetiful trip to England was moest about spoild for
      her; she didn’t noe <i>how</i> she was ever going to be hapy
      thair, noeing th muther and th children worn’t ever going to see
      eech uther no mor—and then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung
      up her hands, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, deer, deer, to think thay ain’t <i>ever</i> going to see
      eech uther eny mor!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But thay <i>wil</i>—and insied of too weeks—and I <i>noe</i>
      it!” sez I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laws, it was out befor I cuud think! And befor I cuud buj she
      throes her arms around mi nek and toeld me to say it <i>agen</i>, say it
      <i>agen</i>, say it <i>agen</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      I see I had spoek too suden and sed too much, and was in a cloez plaes.
      I askt her to let me think a minit; and she set thair, verry impaeshent
      and exsieted and hansum, but luuking kiend of hapy and eezd-up, liek a
      person that’s had a tooth puuld out. So I went to studying it
      out. I sez to mieself, I rekon a body that ups and tels th trooth
      when he is in a tiet plaes is taeking considerabl meny resks, tho I
      ain’t had no expeeryens, and can’t say for serten; but it
      luuks so to me, enyway; and yet heer’s a caes whair I’m blest
      if it don’t luuk to me liek th trooth is beter and actuly <i>saefer</i>
      than a lie. I must lay it bi in mi miend, and think it oever sum tiem
      or uther, it’s so kiend of straenj and unregular. I never see nuthing
      liek it. Wel, I sez to mieself at last, I’m a-going to chans
      it; I’ll up and tel th trooth this tiem, tho it duz seem moest
      liek seting doun on a kag of pouder and tuching it off just to see whair
      u’ll go to. Then I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mis Mary Jane, is thair eny plaes out of toun a litl ways whair
      u cuud go and stay three or foer days?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; Mr. Lothrop’s. Whi?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never miend whi yet. If I’ll tel u how I noe th
      niggers wil see eech uther agen insied of too weeks—heer in this
      hous—and <i>proov</i> how I noe it—wil u go to Mr.
      Lothrop’s and stay foer days?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Foer days!” she sez; “I’ll stay a yeer!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet,” I sez, “I don’t wont nuthing mor
      out of <i>u</i> than just yur werd—I druther hav it than anuther
      man’s kis-th-Biebl.” She smield and redend up verry
      sweet, and I sez, “If u don’t miend it, I’ll shut th
      dor—and boelt it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I cum bak and set doun agen, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t u holler. Just set stil and taek it liek a
      man. I got to tel th trooth, and u wont to braes up, Mis Mary,
      becauz it’s a bad kiend, and going to be hard to taek, but thair ain’t
      no help for it. Thees unkls of yourn ain’t no unkls at all;
      thay’re a cupl of frauds—reguelar ded-beets. Thair,
      now we’re oever th werst of it, u can stand th rest midling
      eezy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It jolted her up liek evrything, of cors; but I was oever th shoel
      wauter now, so I went riet along, her ies a-blaezing hieer and hieer all
      th tiem, and toeld her evry blaem thing, frum whair we ferst struk that
      yung fool going up to th steemboet, cleer thru to whair she flung
      herself on to th king’s brest at th frunt dor and he kist her
      sixteen or seventeen tiems—and then up she jumps, with her faes
      afier liek sunset, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th broot! Cum, don’t waest a minit—not a <i>second</i>—we’ll
      hav them tard and fetherd, and flung in th river!”

      Sez I:

      “Cert’nly. But do u meen <i>befor</i> u go to Mr.
      Lothrop’s, or—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O,” she sez, “whut am I <i>thinking</i> about!”
      she sez, and set riet doun agen. “Don’t miend whut I sed—pleez
      don’t—u <i>wun’t,</i> now, <i>wil</i> u?”
      Laying her silky hand on mien in that kiend of a way that I sed I wuud
      die ferst. “I never thaut, I was so sterd up,” she sez;
      “now go on, and I wun’t do so eny mor. U tel me whut
      to do, and whutever u say I’ll do it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” I sez, “it’s a ruf gang, them too
      frauds, and I’m fixt so I got to travel with them a whiel longger,
      whether I wont to or not—I druther not tel u whi; and if u was
      to blo on them this toun wuud get me out of thair claws, and I’d
      be all riet; but thair’d be anuther person that u don’t

    </p>
    <p>
      Saying them werds puut a guud iedeea in mi hed. I see how maybe I
      cuud get me and Jim rid of th frauds; get them jaeld heer, and then
      leev. But I didn’t wont to run th raft in th daytiem without
      enybody abord to anser qeschuns but me; so I didn’t wont th plan
      to begin werking til prity laet to-niet. I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mis Mary Jane, I’ll tel u whut we’ll do, and u
      wun’t hav to stay at Mr. Lothrop’s so long, nuther. How
      fer is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A litl short of foer miels—riet out in th cuntry, bak
      heer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, that ’ll anser. Now u go along out thair, and
      lay lo til nien or haf-past to-niet, and then get them to fech u
      hoem agen—tel them u’ve thaut of sumthing. If u
      get heer befor eleven puut a candl in this windo, and if I don’t
      tern up waet <i>til</i> eleven, and <i>then</i> if I don’t tern up
      it meens I’m gon, and out of th way, and saef. Then u cum out
      and spred th nues around, and get thees beets jaeld.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guud,” she sez, “I’ll do it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And if it just hapens so that I don’t get away, but get tuuk
      up along with them, u must up and say I toeld u th hoel thing
      beforhand, and u must stand bi me all u can.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stand bi u! indeed I wil. Thay sha’n’t tuch a
      hair of yur hed!” she sez, and I see her nostrils spred and her
      ies snap when she sed it, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I get away I sha’n’t be heer,” I sez, “to

      I jujd we had got evrything fixt about riet now. So I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just let th aucshun go riet along, and don’t wery. Noebody
      don’t hav to pay for th things thay bi til a hoel day after th
      aucshun on acounts of th short noetis, and thay ain’t going out of
      this til thay get that muny; and th way we’ve fixt it th sael
      ain’t going to count, and thay ain’t going to get no muny.
      It’s just liek th way it was with th niggers—it worn’t
      no sael, and th niggers wil be bak befor long. Whi, thay can’t
      colect th muny for th <i>niggers</i> yet—thay’re in th
      werst kiend of a fix, Mis Mary.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” she sez, “I’ll run doun to brekfast now,
      and then I’ll start straet for Mr. Lothrop’s.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “’Deed, <i>that</i> ain’t th tiket, Mis Mary Jane,”
      I sez, “bi no maner of meens; go <i>befor</i> brekfast.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut did u rekon I wonted u to go at all for, Mis Mary?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I never thaut—and cum to think, I don’t noe.
      Whut was it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, it’s becauz u ain’t wun of thees lether-faes
      peepl. I don’t wont no beter buuk than whut yur faes is.
      A body can set doun and red it off liek cors print. Do u
      rekon u can go and faes yur unkls when thay cum to kis u
      guud-morning, and never—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thair, thair, don’t! Yes, I’ll go befor
      brekfast—I’ll be glad to. And leev mi sisters with them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; never miend about them. Thay’ve got to stand it yet
      a whiel. Thay miet suspishun sumthing if all of u was to go.
      I don’t wont u to see them, nor yur sisters, nor noebody in
      this toun; if a naebor was to ask how is yur unkls this morning yur
      faes wuud tel sumthing. No, u go riet along, Mis Mary Jane,
      and I’ll fix it with all of them. I’ll tel Mis Susan to giv
      yur luv to yur unkls and say u’ve went away for a fue ours
      for to get a litl rest and chaenj, or to see a frend, and u’ll
      be bak to-niet or erly in th morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gon to see a frend is all riet, but I wun’t hav mi luv
      given to them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, it sha’n’t be.” It was wel
      enuf to tel <i>her</i> so—no harm in it. It was oenly a
      litl thing to do, and no trubl; and it’s th litl things that
      smooths peepl’s roeds th moest, doun heer belo; it wuud maek Mary
      Jane cumfortabl, and it wouldn’t cost nuthing. Then I sez:
      “Thair’s wun mor thing—that bag of muny.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, thay’ve got that; and it maeks me feel prity sily to
      think <i>how</i> thay got it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, u’re out, thair. Thay hain’t got it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, hoo’s got it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wish I knowed, but I don’t. I <i>had</i> it, becauz
      I stoel it frum them; and I stoel it to giv to u; and I noe whair I
      hid it, but I’m afraed it ain’t thair no mor. I’m
      awful sorry, Mis Mary Jane, I’m just as sorry as I can be; but I
      dun th best I cuud; I did onest. I cum ni geting caut, and
      I had to shuv it into th ferst plaes I cum to, and run—and it
      worn’t a guud plaes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, stop blaeming yurself—it’s too bad to do it, and I
      wun’t alow it—u couldn’t help it; it wasn’t
      yur fallt. Whair did u hied it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t wont to set her to thinking about her trubls agen; and I
      couldn’t seem to get mi mouth to tel her whut wuud maek her see
      that corps laying in th coffin with that bag of muny on his stumac.
      So for a minit I didn’t say nuthing; then I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’d ruther not <i>tel</i> u whair I puut it, Mis Mary
      Jane, if u don’t miend leting me off; but I’ll riet it for
      u on a pees of paeper, and u can red it along th roed to Mr. Lothrop’s,
      if u wont to. Do u rekon that ’ll do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So I roet: “I puut it in th coffin. It was in thair when u
      was crieing thair, away in th niet. I was behiend th dor, and I
      was miety sorry for u, Mis Mary Jane.”

      It maed mi ies wauter a litl to remember her crieing thair all bi herself
      in th niet, and them devils laying thair riet under her oen roof,
      shaming her and robing her; and when I foelded it up and giv it to her I
      see th wauter cum into her ies, too; and she shuuk me bi th hand, hard,
      and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Guud</i>-bi. I’m going to do evrything just as u’ve
      toeld me; and if I don’t ever see u agen, I sha’n’t
      ever forget u and I’ll think of u a meny and a meny a tiem, and
      I’ll <i>pray</i> for u, too!”—and she was gon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pray for me! I rekond if she knowed me she’d taek a job that
      was mor neerer her siez. But I bet she dun it, just th saem—she
      was just that kiend. She had th grit to pray for Judus if she tuuk
      th noeshun—thair worn’t no bak-doun to her, I juj. U
      may say whut u wont to, but in mi opinyon she had mor sand in her than
      eny gerl I ever see; in mi opinyon she was just fuul of sand. It
      sounds liek flatery, but it ain’t no flatery. And when it
      cums to buety—and guudnes, too—she lays oever them all.
      I hain’t ever seen her sinss that tiem that I see her go out
      of that dor; no, I hain’t ever seen her sinss, but I rekon I’ve
      thaut of her a meny and a meny a milyon tiems, and of her saying she
      wuud pray for me; and if ever I’d a thaut it wuud do eny guud
      for me to pray for <i>her</i>, blaemd if I wouldn’t a dun it or
      bust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, Mary Jane she lit out th bak way, I rekon; becauz noebody see her
      go. When I struk Susan and th hair-lip, I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut’s th naem of them peepl oever on t’uther sied of
      th river that u all goes to see sumtiems?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay sez:

    <p>
      “Thair’s several; but it’s th Proctors, maenly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s th naem,” I sez; “I moest forgot it.
      Wel, Mis Mary Jane she toeld me to tel u she’s gon oever

    </p>
    <p>
      “Which wun?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t noe; leastways, I kiender forget; but I thinks it’s—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sakes aliev, I hoep it ain’t <i>Hanner</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m sorry to say it,” I sez, “but Hanner’s
      th verry wun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mi guudnes, and she so wel oenly last week! Is she tuuk bad?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It ain’t no naem for it. Thay set up with her all

    </p>
    <p>
      “Oenly think of that, now! Whut’s th mater with her?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn’t think of enything reezonabl, riet off that way, so I

      “Mumps.”

      Evrything was all riet now. Th gerls wouldn’t say nuthing

      do that verry handy, not being brung up to it.

    <p>
      Wel, thay held th aucshun in th public sqair, along tords th end of

      was on hand and luuking his level pisonest, up thair longside of th
      aucshuneer, and chiping in a litl Scripcher now and then, or a litl

    <p>
      Thay was feching a verry nies-luuking oeld jentlman along, and a
      nies-luuking yungger wun, with his riet arm in a sling. And, mi
      soels, how th peepl yeld and laft, and kept it up. But I didn’t
      see no joek about it, and I jujd it wuud straen th duek and th king
      sum to see eny. I rekond thay’d tern pael. But no,
      nairy a pael did <i>thay</i> tern. Th duek he never let on he suspicioned
      whut was up, but just went a goo-gooing around, hapy and satisfied, liek
      a jug that’s googling out butermilk; and as for th king, he just
      gaezd and gaezd doun sorroeful on them nue-comers liek it giv him th
      stumac-aek in his verry hart to think thair cuud be such frauds and
      rascals in th werld. O, he dun it admerabl. Lots of th
      prinsipal peepl gethered around th king, to let him see thay was on his
      sied. That oeld jentlman that had just cum luukt all puzld to
      deth. Prity soon he begun to speek, and I see straet off he
      pronounst <i>liek</i> an Englishman—not th king’s way,
      tho th king’s <i>was</i> prity guud for an imitaeshun. I
      can’t giv th oeld gent’s werds, nor I can’t imitaet
      him; but he ternd around to th croud, and sez, about liek this:
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is a serpriez to me which I wasn’t luuking for; and I’ll
      aknolej, candid and frank, I ain’t verry wel fixt to meet it
      and anser it; for mi bruther and me has had misforchens; he’s broek
      his arm, and our bagej got puut off at a toun abuv heer last niet in
      th niet bi a mistaek. I am Peeter Wilks’ bruther Harvey, and
      this is his bruther William, which can’t heer nor speek—and
      can’t eeven maek siens to amount to much, now’t he’s oenly
      got wun hand to werk them with. We ar hoo we say we ar; and in a
      day or too, when I get th bagej, I can proov it. But up til then I wun’t
      say nuthing mor, but go to th hoetel and waet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So him and th nue dumy started off; and th king he lafs, and blethers
      out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Broek his arm—<i>verry</i> liekly, <i>ain’t</i> it?—and
      verry conveenyunt, too, for a fraud that’s got to maek siens, and ain’t
      learnt how. Lost thair bagej! That’s <i>miety</i> guud!—and
      miety injeenius—under th <i>sercumstanses</i>!”
    </p>
    <p>
      So he laft agen; and so did evrybody els, exsept three or foer, or
      maybe haf a duzen. Wun of thees was that doctor; anuther wun was a
      sharp-luuking jentlman, with a carpet-bag of th oeld-fashund kiend maed
      out of carpet-stuf, that had just cum off of th steemboet and was
      tauking to him in a lo vois, and glansing tords th king now and then
      and noding thair heds—it was Levi Bel, th lawyer that was gon
      up to Louisville; and anuther wun was a big ruf husky that cum along
      and lisend to all th oeld jentlman sed, and was lisening to th king
      now. And when th king got dun this husky up and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say, luuky heer; if u ar Harvey Wilks, when’d u cum to
      this toun?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th day befor th fueneral, frend,” sez th king.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But whut tiem o’ day?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In th evenin’—’bout an our er too befor
      sundoun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>How’d</i> u cum?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I cum doun on th Susan Powell frum Cincinnati.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, how’d u cum to be up at th Pient in th <i>mornin</i>’—in
      a canoo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I worn’t up at th Pient in th mornin’.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a lie.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of them jumpt for him and begd him not to tauk that way to an
      oeld man and a preecher.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Preecher be hangd, he’s a fraud and a lieer. He was up
      at th Pient that mornin’. I liv up thair, don’t I?
      Wel, I was up thair, and he was up thair. I see him thair.
      He cum in a canoo, along with Tim Collins and a boy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th doctor he up and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wuud u noe th boy agen if u was to see him, Hines?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I rekon I wuud, but I don’t noe. Whi, yonder he is,
      now. I noe him perfectly eezy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was me he pointed at. Th doctor sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Naebors, I don’t noe whether th nue cupl is frauds or
      not; but if <i>thees</i> too ain’t frauds, I am an idiot, that’s
      all. I think it’s our duety to see that thay don’t get
      away frum heer til we’ve luukt into this thing. Cum along, Hines;
      cum along, th rest of u. We’ll taek thees feloes to th
      tavern and afrunt them with t’uther cupl, and I rekon we’ll
      fiend out <i>sumthing</i> befor we get thru.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nuts for th croud, tho maybe not for th king’s frends;
      so we all started. It was about sundoun. Th doctor he led me
      along bi th hand, and was plenty kiend enuf, but he never let go mi
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c29-252" id="c29-252"></a><br> <br>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      We all got in a big room in th hoetel, and lit up sum candls, and
      fetched in th nue cupl. Ferst, th doctor sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t wish to be too hard on thees too men, but I think
      thay’re frauds, and thay may hav complices that we don’t noe
      nuthing about. If thay hav, wun’t th complices get away with
      that bag of goeld Peeter Wilks left? It ain’t unliekly. If
      thees men ain’t frauds, thay wun’t object to sending for that
      muny and leting us keep it til thay proov thay’re all riet—ain’t
      that so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Evrybody agreed to that. So I jujd thay had our gang in a prity
      tiet plaes riet at th outstart. But th king he oenly luukt
      sorroeful, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Jentlmen, I wish th muny was thair, for I ain’t got no
      dispozishun to thro enything in th way of a fair, oepen, out-and-out
      investigaeshun o’ this misable biznes; but, alas, th muny ain’t
      thair; u k’n send and see, if u wont to.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whair is it, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, when mi nees giv it to me to keep for her I tuuk and hid it
      insied o’ th straw tik o’ mi bed, not wishin’ to bank
      it for th fue days we’d be heer, and considerin’ th bed a
      saef plaes, we not bein’ uezd to niggers, and suppos’n’ 
      ’em onest, liek servants in England. Th niggers stoel it th
      verry next mornin’ after I had went doun stairs; and when I soeld
      ’em I hadn’t mist th muny yit, so thay got cleen away with
      it. Mi servant heer k’n tel u ’bout it, jentlmen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th doctor and several sed “Shuks!” and I see noebody didn’t
      alltogether beleev him. Wun man askt me if I see th niggers steel
      it. I sed no, but I see them sneeking out of th room and husling
      away, and I never thaut nuthing, oenly I rekond thay was afraed thay
      had waekt up mi master and was trieing to get away befor he maed trubl
      with them. That was all thay askt me. Then th doctor wherls
      on me and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ar <i>u</i> English, too?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sez yes; and him and sum uthers laft, and sed, “Stuf!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, then thay saeld in on th jeneral investigaeshun, and thair we had
      it, up and doun, our in, our out, and noebody never sed a werd about
      super, nor ever seemd to think about it—and so thay kept it up,
      and kept it up; and it <i>was</i> th werst mixt-up thing u ever see.
      Thay maed th king tel his yarn, and thay maed th oeld jentlman
      tel his’n; and enybody but a lot of prejudist chuckleheads wuud a
      <i>seen</i> that th oeld jentlman was spining trooth and t’uther
      wun lies. And bi and bi thay had me up to tel whut I knowed. Th
      king he giv me a left-handed luuk out of th corner of his ie, and so I
      knowed enuf to tauk on th riet sied. I begun to tel about
      Sheffield, and how we livd thair, and all about th English Wilkses, and
      so on; but I didn’t get prity fer til th doctor begun to laf;
      and Levi Bel, th lawyer, sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Set doun, mi boy; I wouldn’t straen mieself if I was u.
      I rekon u ain’t uezd to lieing, it don’t seem to cum
      handy; whut u wont is practis. U do it prity aukward.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t cair nuthing for th compliment, but I was glad to be let
      off, enyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th doctor he started to say sumthing, and terns and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “If u’d bin in toun at ferst, Levi Bel—” Th
      king broek in and reecht out his hand, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, is this mi pur ded bruther’s oeld frend that he’s
      roet so offen about?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th lawyer and him shuuk hands, and th lawyer smield and luukt pleezd,
      and thay taukt riet along awhiel, and then got to wun sied and taukt
      lo; and at last th lawyer speeks up and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “That ’ll fix it. I’ll taek th order and send it,
      along with yur bruther’s, and then thay’ll noe it’s
      all riet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So thay got sum paeper and a pen, and th king he set doun and twisted his
      hed to wun sied, and chawed his tung, and scralld off sumthing; and
      then thay giv th pen to th duek—and then for th ferst tiem th
      duek luukt sik. But he tuuk th pen and roet. So then th
      lawyer terns to th nue oeld jentlman and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “U and yur bruther pleez riet a lien or too and sien yur
      naems.”
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Th oeld jentlman roet, but noebody couldn’t red it. Th
      lawyer luukt powerful astonisht, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, it beets <i>me</i>”—and snaekt a lot of oeld
      leters out of his poket, and examind them, and then examind th oeld
      man’s rieting, and then <i>them</i> agen; and then sez: “Thees
      oeld leters is frum Harvey Wilks; and heer’s <i>thees</i> too
      handwritings, and enybody can see thay didn’t riet them” (th
      king and th duek luukt soeld and foolish, I tel u, to see how th
      lawyer had tuuk them in), “and heer’s <i>this</i> oeld
      jentlman’s hand rieting, and enybody can tel, eezy enuf, <i>he</i>
      didn’t riet them—fact is, th scraches he maeks ain’t
      properly <i>rieting</i> at all. Now, heer’s sum leters frum—”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th nue oeld jentlman sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “If u pleez, let me explaen. Noebody can red mi hand but mi
      bruther thair—so he copys for me. It’s <i>his</i> hand
      u’ve got thair, not mien.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Wel</i>!” sez th lawyer, “this <i>is</i> a staet
      of things. I’ve got sum of William’s leters, too; so
      if u’ll get him to riet a lien or so we can com—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He <i>can’t</i> riet with his left hand,” sez th oeld
      jentlman. “If he cuud ues his riet hand, u wuud see that he
      roet his oen leters and mien too. Luuk at boeth, pleez—thay’re
      bi th saem hand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th lawyer dun it, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I beleev it’s so—and if it ain’t so, thair’s
      a heep strongger rezemblans than I’d noetist befor, enyway. Wel,
      wel, wel! I thaut we was riet on th trak of a solooshun, but
      it’s gon to gras, partly. But enyway, wun thing is proovd—<i>thees</i>
      too ain’t eether of ’em Wilkses”—and he wagd his
      hed tords th king and th duek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, whut do u think? That muleheaded oeld fool wouldn’t
      giv in <i>then</i>! Indeed he wouldn’t. Sed it worn’t
      no fair test. Sed his bruther William was th cussedest joeker in
      th werld, and hadn’t tried to riet—<i>he</i> see William was
      going to play wun of his joeks th minit he puut th pen to paeper. And
      so he wormd up and went worbling and worbling riet along til he was
      actuly begining to beleev whut he was saying <i>himself</i>; but prity
      soon th nue jentlman broek in, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ve thaut of sumthing. Is thair enybody heer that
      helpt to lay out mi br—helpt to lay out th laet Peeter Wilks for
      berrying?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” sez sumbody, “me and Ab Terner dun it. We’re
      boeth heer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then th oeld man terns tords th king, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps this jentlman can tel me whut was tatood on his brest?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaemd if th king didn’t hav to braes up miety qik, or he’d
      a squshed doun liek a bluf bank that th river has cut under, it tuuk him
      so suden; and, miend u, it was a thing that was calcuelaeted to maek moest
      <i>enybody</i> sqush to get fetched such a solid wun as that without eny
      noetis, becauz how was <i>he</i> going to noe whut was tatood on th
      man? He whietend a litl; he couldn’t help it; and it was
      miety stil in thair, and evrybody bending a litl forwards and gaezing
      at him. Sez I to mieself, <i>now</i> he’ll thro up th spunj—thair
      ain’t no mor ues. Wel, did he? A body can’t
      hardly beleev it, but he didn’t. I rekon he thaut he’d
      keep th thing up til he tierd them peepl out, so thay’d thin out,
      and him and th duek cuud braek loos and get away. Enyway, he set
      thair, and prity soon he begun to smiel, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mf! It’s a <i>verry</i> tuf qeschun, <i>ain’t</i>
      it! <i>yes</i>, ser, I k’n tel u whut’s tatood on
      his brest. It’s jest a small, thin, bloo arro—that’s
      whut it is; and if u don’t luuk clost, u can’t see it.
      <i>now</i> whut do u say—hay?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, I never see enything liek that oeld blister for cleen out-and-out
      cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th nue oeld jentlman terns brisk tords Ab Terner and his pard, and his
      ie liets up liek he jujd he’d got th king <i>this</i> tiem, and
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thair—u’ve herd whut he sed! Was thair eny
      such mark on Peeter Wilks’ brest?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Boeth of them spoek up and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “We didn’t see no such mark.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guud!” sez th oeld jentlman. “Now, whut u <i>did</i>
      see on his brest was a small dim P, and a B (which is an inishal he
      dropt when he was yung), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P—B—W”—and
      he markt them that way on a pees of paeper. “Cum, ain’t that
      whut u saw?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Boeth of them spoek up agen, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, we <i>didn’t</i>. We never seen eny marks at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, evrybody <i>was</i> in a staet of miend now, and thay sings out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th hoel <i>bilin</i>’ of ’m ’s frauds! Le’s
      duk ’em! le’s droun ’em! le’s ried ’em on a
      rael!” and evrybody was hooping at wuns, and thair was a ratling
      powwow. But th lawyer he jumps on th taebl and yels, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Jentlmen—jentl<i>men!</i> Heer me just a werd—just
      a <i>singgl</i> werd—if u <i>pleez</i>! Thair’s wun
      way yet—let’s go and dig up th corps and luuk.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c29-257" id="c29-257"></a><br> <br>

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      That tuuk them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hooray!” thay all shouted, and was starting riet off; but
      th lawyer and th doctor sung out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoeld on, hoeld on! Colar all thees foer men and th boy, and
      fech <i>them</i> along, too!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We’ll do it!” thay all shouted; “and if we don’t
      fiend them marks we’ll linch th hoel gang!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I <i>was</i> scaird, now, I tel u. But thair worn’t no
      geting away, u noe. Thay gript us all, and marcht us riet along,
      straet for th graev-yard, which was a miel and a haf doun th river,
      and th hoel toun at our heels, for we maed noiz enuf, and it was oenly
      nien in th eevning.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we went bi our hous I wisht I hadn’t sent Mary Jane out of
      toun; becauz now if I cuud tip her th wink she’d liet out and
      saev me, and blo on our ded-beets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, we swormd along doun th river roed, just carrying on liek
      wildcats; and to maek it mor scairy th skie was darking up, and th
      lietning begining to wink and fliter, and th wiend to shiver amungst
      th leevs. This was th moest awful trubl and moest dangersome I ever was
      in; and I was kiender stund; evrything was going so diferent frum whut
      I had alowd for; sted of being fixt so I cuud taek mi oen tiem if I
      wonted to, and see all th fun, and hav Mary Jane at mi bak to saev me
      and set me free when th cloez-fit cum, heer was nuthing in th werld
      betwixt me and suden deth but just them tatoo-marks. If thay didn’t
      fiend them—
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn’t bair to think about it; and yet, sumhow, I couldn’t
      think about nuthing els. It got darker and darker, and it was a
      buetiful tiem to giv th croud th slip; but that big husky had me bi
      th rist—Hines—and a body miet as wel tri to giv Goliar
      th slip. He dragd me riet along, he was so exsieted, and I had to
      run to keep up.
    </p>
    <p>
      When thay got thair thay swormd into th graev-yard and wosht oever it
      liek an oeverflo. And when thay got to th graev thay found thay had
      about a hundred tiems as meny shuvels as thay wonted, but noebody hadn’t
      thaut to fech a lantern. But thay saeld into diging enyway bi
      th fliker of th lietning, and sent a man to th neerest hous, a haf
      a miel off, to borro wun.
    </p>
    <p>
      So thay dug and dug liek evrything; and it got awful dark, and th raen
      started, and th wiend swisht and swushed along, and th lietning cum
      brisker and brisker, and th thunder boomd; but them peepl never tuuk no
      noetis of it, thay was so fuul of this biznes; and wun minit u cuud
      see evrything and evry faes in that big croud, and th shovelfuls of
      dert saeling up out of th graev, and th next second th dark wiept it
      all out, and u couldn’t see nuthing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last thay got out th coffin and begun to unscroo th lid, and then
      such anuther crouding and shoeldering and shuving as thair was, to scrouge
      in and get a siet, u never see; and in th dark, that way, it was
      awful. Hines he hert mi rist dredful puuling and tuging so, and I
      rekon he cleen forgot I was in th werld, he was so exsieted and panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of a suden th lietning let go a perfect sloos of whiet glair, and
      sumbody sings out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bi th living jingo, heer’s th bag of goeld on his brest!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Hines let out a hoop, liek evrybody els, and dropt mi rist and giv
      a big serj to bust his way in and get a luuk, and th way I lit out and
      shinned for th roed in th dark thair ain’t noebody can tel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had th roed all to mieself, and I fairly floo—leastways, I had it
      all to mieself exsept th solid dark, and th now-and-then glairs, and th
      buzing of th raen, and th thrashing of th wiend, and th spliting of
      th thunder; and shur as u ar born I did clip it along!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I struk th toun I see thair worn’t noebody out in th storm,
      so I never hunted for no bak streets, but humpt it straet thru th
      maen wun; and when I begun to get tords our hous I aemd mi ie and set
      it. No liet thair; th hous all dark—which maed me feel sorry and
      disapointed, I didn’t noe whi. But at last, just as I was
      saeling bi, <i>flash</i> cums th liet in Mary Jane’s windo! and
      mi hart sweld up suden, liek to bust; and th saem second th hous
      and all was behiend me in th dark, and wasn’t ever going to be
      befor me no mor in this werld. She <i>was</i> th best gerl I ever see,
      and had th moest sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th minit I was far enuf abuv th toun to see I cuud maek th
      toehed, I begun to luuk sharp for a boet to borro, and th ferst tiem
      th lietning shoed me wun that wasn’t chained I snacht it and
      shuvd. It was a canoo, and worn’t fasend with nuthing but a roep.
      Th toehed was a ratling big distans off, away out thair in th
      midl of th river, but I didn’t looz no tiem; and when I struk
      th raft at last I was so fagd I wuud a just laed doun to blo and gasp
      if I cuud aforded it. But I didn’t. As I sprung abord
      I sung out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Out with u, Jim, and set her loos! Glory be to guudnes,
      we’re shut of them!”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c29-260" id="c29-260"></a><br> <br>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim lit out, and was a-cuming for me with boeth arms spred, he was so fuul
      of joy; but when I glimpst him in th lietning mi hart shot up in mi
      mouth and I went oeverbord bakwards; for I forgot he was oeld King Lear
      and a drownded A-rab all in wun, and it moest scaird th livers and liets
      out of me. But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and bles
      me, and so on, he was so glad I was bak and we was shut of th king and
      th duek, but I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not now; hav it for brekfast, hav it for brekfast! Cut
      loos and let her slied!”
    </p>
    <p>
      So in too seconds away we went a-slieding doun th river, and it <i>did</i>
      seem so guud to be free agen and all bi ourselvs on th big river, and
      noebody to bother us. I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and
      crak mi heels a fue tiems—I couldn’t help it; but about th
      therd crak I noetist a sound that I knowed miety wel, and held mi
      breth and lisend and waeted; and shur enuf, when th next flash
      busted out oever th wauter, heer thay cum!—and just a-laying to
      thair ors and maeking thair skif hum! It was th king and th duek.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I wilted riet doun on to th planks then, and giv up; and it was all
      I cuud do to keep frum crieing.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXX.
    </p>
    <p>
      When thay got abord th king went for me, and shuuk me bi th colar, and
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tryin’ to giv us th slip, was ye, u pup! Tierd of
      our cumpany, hay?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, yur majesty, we worn’t—<i>pleez</i> don’t,
      yur majesty!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Qik, then, and tel us whut <i>was</i> yur iedeea, or I’ll
      shaek th insieds out o’ u!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Onest, I’ll tel u evrything just as it hapend, yur
      majesty. Th man that had a-holt of me was verry guud to me, and kept
      saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last yeer, and he was
      sorry to see a boy in such a daenjerus fix; and when thay was all tuuk bi
      serpriez bi fiending th goeld, and maed a rush for th coffin, he lets go
      of me and whispers, ‘Heel it now, or thay’ll hang ye, shur!’ 
      and I lit out. It didn’t seem no guud for <i>me</i> to stay—I
      couldn’t do nuthing, and I didn’t wont to be hung if I cuud
      get away. So I never stopt runing til I found th canoo; and
      when I got heer I toeld Jim to hery, or thay’d cach me and hang me
      yet, and sed I was afeard u and th duek wasn’t aliev now, and I
      was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we see u
      cuming; u may ask Jim if I didn’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim sed it was so; and th king toeld him to shut up, and sed, “O,
      yes, it’s <i>miety</i> liekly!” and shuuk me up agen, and
      sed he rekond he’d drownd me. But th duek sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Leggo th boy, u oeld idiot! Wuud <i>u</i> a dun eny
      diferent? Did u inqier around for <i>him</i> when u got loos?
      I don’t remember it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So th king let go of me, and begun to cuss that toun and evrybody in it.
      But th duek sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “U beter a blaem’ siet giv <i>yurself</i> a guud
      cussing, for u’re th wun that’s entietld to it moest. U
      hain’t dun a thing frum th start that had eny sens in it, exsept
      cuming out so cool and cheeky with that imajinairy bloo-arro mark. That
      <i>was</i> briet—it was riet doun buuly; and it was th thing that
      saevd us. For if it hadn’t bin for that thay’d a jaeld
      us til them Englishmen’s bagej cum—and then—th
      penitenshery, u bet! But that trik tuuk ’em to th graev-yard, and
      th goeld dun us a stil biger kiendnes; for if th exsieted fools hadn’t
      let go all holts and maed that rush to get a luuk we’d a slept in
      our cravats to-niet—cravats waranted to <i>wair</i>, too—longger
      than <i>we’d</i> need ’em.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay was stil a minit—thinking; then th king sez, kiend of
      absent-miended liek:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mf! And we rekond th <i>niggers</i> stoel it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      That maed me sqerm!
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” sez th duek, kiender slo and deliberaet and
      sarcastic, “<i>we</i> did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After about a haf a minit th king drawls out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Leastways, I did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th duek sez, th saem way:
    </p>
    <p>
      “On th contrairy, I did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th king kiend of rufls up, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Luuky heer, Bilgewater, whut’r u referrin’ to?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th duek sez, prity brisk:
    </p>
    <p>
      “When it cums to that, maybe u’ll let me ask, whut was <i>u</i>
      refering to?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shuks!” sez th king, verry sarcastic; “but I don’t
      noe—maybe u was asleep, and didn’t noe whut u was about.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th duek brisls up now, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, let <i>up</i> on this cussed nonsens; do u taek me for a
      blaem’ fool? Don’t u rekon I noe hoo hid that muny in
      that coffin?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Yes</i>, ser! I noe u <i>do</i> noe, becauz u dun
      it yurself!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a lie!”—and th duek went for him. Th
      king sings out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Taek y’r hands off!—leggo mi throet!—I taek it
      all bak!”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c30-263" id="c30-263"></a><br> <br>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c30-263.jpg (54K)" src="./HuckFinn_files/c30-263.jpg" style="width:100%;"><br>
    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Th duek sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, u just oen up, ferst, that u <i>did</i> hied that muny
      thair, intending to giv me th slip wun of thees days, and cum bak and
      dig it up, and hav it all to yurself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Waet jest a minit, duek—anser me this wun qeschun, onest
      and fair; if u didn’t puut th muny thair, say it, and I’ll
      b’lieve u, and taek bak evrything I sed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U oeld scoundrel, I didn’t, and u noe I didn’t.
      Thair, now!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, I b’lieve u. But anser me oenly jest this
      wun mor—now <i>don’t</i> git mad; didn’t u hav it in
      yur miend to huuk th muny and hied it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th duek never sed nuthing for a litl bit; then he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I don’t cair if I <i>did</i>, I didn’t <i>do</i>
      it, enyway. But u not oenly had it in miend to do it, but u <i>dun</i>
      it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wisht I never die if I dun it, duek, and that’s onest.
      I wun’t say I worn’t goin’ to do it, becauz I <i>was</i>;
      but u—I meen sumbody—got in ahed o’ me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a lie! U dun it, and u got to <i>say</i> u
      dun it, or—”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th king began to gergl, and then he gasps out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “’Nough!—I <i>oen up!</i>”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was verry glad to heer him say that; it maed me feel much mor eezyer
      than whut I was feeling befor. So th duek tuuk his hands off and
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “If u ever deni it agen I’ll droun u. It’s <i>wel</i>
      for u to set thair and bluber liek a baeby—it’s fitten for
      u, after th way u’ve acted. I never see such an oeld ostrich for
      wonting to gobl evrything—and I a-trusting u all th tiem, liek
      u was mi oen faather. U aut to bin ashaemd of yurself to
      stand bi and heer it sadld on to a lot of pur niggers, and u never
      say a werd for ’em. It maeks me feel ridicuelus to think I was
      sofft enuf to <i>beleev</i> that rubbage. Cuss u, I can see now
      whi u was so ankshus to maek up th deffisit—u wonted to get
      whut muny I’d got out of th Nonesuch and wun thing or anuther, and
      scoop it <i>all</i>!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th king sez, timid, and stil a-snuffling:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, duek, it was u that sed maek up th deffisit; it worn’t
      me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dri up! I don’t wont to heer no mor out of u!”
      sez th duek. “And <i>now</i> u see whut u GOT bi it. Thay’ve
      got all thair oen muny bak, and all of <i>ourn</i> but a shekel or too
      <i>besieds</i>. G’long to bed, and don’t u deffersit
      <i>me</i> no mor deffersits, long ’s <i>u</i> liv!”
    </p>
    <p>
      So th king sneekt into th wigwom and tuuk to his botl for cumfort,
      and befor long th duek takld HIS botl; and so in about a haf an
      our thay was as thik as theevs agen, and th tieter thay got th
      lovinger thay got, and went off a-snoring in eech uther’s arms.
      Thay boeth got powerful melo, but I noetist th king didn’t
      get melo enuf to forget to remember to not deni about hieding th
      muny-bag agen. That maed me feel eezy and satisfied. Of
      cors when thay got to snoring we had a long gabl, and I toeld Jim
      evrything.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXI.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dasn’t stop agen at eny toun for days and days; kept riet along
      doun th river. We was doun south in th worm wether now, and a
      miety long ways frum hoem. We begun to cum to trees with Spanish
      moss on them, hanging doun frum th lims liek long, gray beerds. It
      was th ferst I ever see it groeing, and it maed th wuuds luuk solem and
      dizmal. So now th frauds rekond thay was out of daenjer, and thay
      begun to werk th vilejes agen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferst thay dun a lekcher on temperans; but thay didn’t maek enuf
      for them boeth to get drunk on. Then in anuther vilej thay started
      a dansing-scool; but thay didn’t noe no mor how to dans than a
      kangaroo duz; so th ferst prans thay maed th jeneral public jumpt in
      and pranced them out of toun. Anuther tiem thay tried to go at
      yellocution; but thay didn’t yellocute long til th audyens got up
      and giv them a solid guud cussing, and maed them skip out. Thay
      takld missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and teling
      forchuns, and a litl of evrything; but thay couldn’t seem to hav
      no luk. So at last thay got just about ded broek, and laed around
      th raft as she floeted along, thinking and thinking, and never saying
      nuthing, bi th haf a day at a tiem, and dredful bloo and desperet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at last thay tuuk a chaenj and begun to lay thair heds together in
      th wigwom and tauk lo and confidenshal too or three ours at a tiem. Jim
      and me got uneezy. We didn’t liek th luuk of it. We
      jujd thay was studying up sum kiend of wers deviltry than ever. We
      ternd it oever and oever, and at last we maed up our miends thay was going
      to braek into sumbody’s hous or stor, or was going into th
      counterfit-muny biznes, or sumthing. So then we was prity scaird,
      and maed up an agreement that we wouldn’t hav nuthing in th werld
      to do with such acshuns, and if we ever got th leest sho we wuud giv
      them th coeld shaek and cleer out and leev them behiend. Wel, erly wun
      morning we hid th raft in a guud, saef plaes about too miel belo a
      litl bit of a shaby vilej naemd Pikesville, and th king he went
      ashor and toeld us all to stay hid whilst he went up to toun and smelt
      around to see if enybody had got eny wiend of th Royal Nonesuch thair yet.
      (“Hous to rob, u <i>meen</i>,” sez I to mieself; “and
      when u get thru robing it u’ll cum bak heer and wunder
      whut has becum of me and Jim and th raft—and u’ll hav to
      taek it out in wundering.”) And he sed if he worn’t bak bi
      midday th duek and me wuud noe it was all riet, and we was to cum
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we stayd whair we was. Th duek he freted and sweted around,
      and was in a miety sour way. He scoelded us for evrything, and we
      couldn’t seem to do nuthing riet; he found fallt with evry litl
      thing. Sumthing was a-brooing, shur. I was guud and glad when
      midday cum and no king; we cuud hav a chaenj, enyway—and maybe a
      chans for <i>th</i> chaenj on top of it. So me and th duek went
      up to th vilej, and hunted around thair for th king, and bi and bi we
      found him in th bak room of a litl lo doggery, verry tiet, and a lot
      of loefers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-thretening
      with all his miet, and so tiet he couldn’t wauk, and couldn’t
      do nuthing to them. Th duek he begun to abues him for an oeld fool,
      and th king begun to sass bak, and th minit thay was fairly at it I
      lit out and shuuk th reefs out of mi hiend legs, and spun doun th river
      roed liek a deer, for I see our chans; and I maed up mi miend that it
      wuud be a long day befor thay ever see me and Jim agen. I got
      doun thair all out of breth but loeded up with joy, and sung out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Set her loos, Jim! we’re all riet now!”
    </p>
    <p>
      But thair worn’t no anser, and noebody cum out of th wigwom.
      Jim was gon! I set up a shout—and then anuther—and
      then anuther wun; and run this way and that in th wuuds, hooping and
      screeching; but it worn’t no ues—oeld Jim was gon. Then
      I set doun and cried; I couldn’t help it. But I couldn’t set
      stil long. Prity soon I went out on th roed, trieing to think whut
      I beter do, and I run across a boy wauking, and askt him if he’d
      seen a straenj nigger drest so and so, and he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whairabouts?” sez I.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doun to Silas Phelps’ plaes, too miel belo heer. He’s
      a runaway nigger, and thay’ve got him. Was u luuking for
      him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U bet I ain’t! I run across him in th wuuds about an
      our or too ago, and he sed if I holerd he’d cut mi livers out—and
      toeld me to lay doun and stay whair I was; and I dun it. Bin thair
      ever sinss; afeard to cum out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” he sez, “u needn’t be afeard no mor,
      becuz thay’ve got him. He run off f’m doun South, som’ers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a guud job thay got him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I <i>rekon</i>! Thair’s too hunderd dolars
      reword on him. It’s liek piking up muny out’n th
      roed.”

      “It was an oeld felo—a straenjer—and he soeld out his
      chans in him for forty dolars, becuz he’s got to go up th river
      and can’t waet. Think o’ that, now! U bet <i>I’d</i>

    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s me, evry tiem,” sez I. “But maybe his
      chans ain’t werth no mor than that, if he’ll sel it so
      cheep. Maybe thair’s sumthing ain’t straet about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But it <i>is</i>, tho—straet as a string. I see
      th handbil mieself. It tels all about him, to a dot—paents
      him liek a pikcher, and tels th plantaeshun he’s frum, belo Newr<i>leens</i>.

    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t hav nun, so he left. I went to th raft, and set
      doun in th wigwom to think. But I couldn’t cum to nuthing.
      I thaut til I wor mi hed sor, but I couldn’t see no way
      out of th trubl. After all this long jerny, and after all we’d
      dun for them scoundrels, heer it was all cum to nuthing, evrything all
      busted up and rooind, becauz thay cuud hav th hart to serv Jim such
      a trik as that, and maek him a slaev agen all his lief, and amungst
      straenjers, too, for forty derty dolars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wuns I sed to mieself it wuud be a thouzand tiems beter for Jim to be a
      slaev at hoem whair his family was, as long as he’d <i>got</i> to be
      a slaev, and so I’d beter riet a leter to Tom Sawyer and tel him
      to tel Mis Watson whair he was. But I soon giv up that noeshun for
      too things: she’d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and
      ungratefulness for leeving her, and so she’d sel him straet doun
      th river agen; and if she didn’t, evrybody nacheraly despiezes an
      ungraetful nigger, and thay’d maek Jim feel it all th tiem, and so
      he’d feel ornery and disgraest. And then think of <i>me</i>! It
      wuud get all around that Huck Finn helpt a nigger to get his freedom;
      and if I was ever to see enybody frum that toun agen I’d be redy
      to get doun and lik his boots for shaem. That’s just th way:
      a person duz a lo-doun thing, and then he don’t wont to taek
      no conseqenses of it. Thinks as long as he can hied it, it ain’t no
      disgraes. That was mi fix exactly. Th mor I studyd about this th
      mor mi conshens went to griending me, and th mor wiked and lo-doun
      and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a suden
      that heer was th plaen hand of Providens slaping me in th faes and
      leting me noe mi wikednes was being wocht all th tiem frum up thair
      in heven, whilst I was steeling a pur oeld wuuman’s nigger that hadn’t
      ever dun me no harm, and now was shoeing me thair’s Wun that’s
      allways on th luukout, and ain’t a-going to alow no such mizerabl
      doings to go oenly just so fer and no ferther, I moest dropt in mi traks
      I was so scaird. Wel, I tried th best I cuud to kiender soffen it
      up sumhow for mieself bi saying I was brung up wiked, and so I worn’t
      so much to blaem; but sumthing insied of me kept saying, “Thair was
      th Sunday-scool, u cuud a gon to it; and if u’d a dun it
      thay’d a learnt u thair that peepl that acts as I’d bin
      acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fier.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It maed me shiver. And I about maed up mi miend to pray, and see if I
      couldn’t tri to qit being th kiend of a boy I was and be beter.
      So I neeld doun. But th werds wouldn’t cum. Whi
      wouldn’t thay? It worn’t no ues to tri and hied it frum
      Him. Nor frum <i>me</i>, neether. I knowed verry wel whi thay
      wouldn’t cum. It was becauz mi hart worn’t riet; it
      was becauz I worn’t sqair; it was becauz I was playing dubl.
      I was leting <i>on</i> to giv up sin, but away insied of me I was
      hoelding on to th bigest wun of all. I was trieing to maek mi mouth
      <i>say</i> I wuud do th riet thing and th cleen thing, and go and
      riet to that nigger’s oener and tel whair he was; but deep doun in
      me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. U can’t pray a
      lie—I found that out.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I was fuul of trubl, fuul as I cuud be; and didn’t noe whut
      to do. At last I had an iedeea; and I sez, I’ll go and riet th
      leter—and then see if I can pray. Whi, it was astonishing,
      th way I felt as liet as a fether riet straet off, and mi trubls
      all gon. So I got a pees of paeper and a pensil, all glad and
      exsieted, and set doun and roet:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mis Watson, yur runaway nigger Jim is doun heer too miel belo
      Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he wil giv him up for th
      reword if u send.

      I felt guud and all wosht cleen of sin for th ferst tiem I had ever felt
      so in mi lief, and I knowed I cuud pray now. But I didn’t do
      it straet off, but laed th paeper doun and set thair thinking—thinking
      how guud it was all this hapend so, and how neer I cum to being lost
      and going to hel. And went on thinking. And got to thinking
      oever our trip doun th river; and I see Jim befor me all th tiem: in
      th day and in th niet-tiem, sumtiems moonliet, sumtiems storms, and
      we a-floeting along, tauking and singing and lafing. But sumhow I
      couldn’t seem to striek no plaeses to harden me agenst him, but oenly
      th uther kiend. I’d see him standing mi woch on top of his’n,
      ’sted of calling me, so I cuud go on sleeping; and see him how
      glad he was when I cum bak out of th fog; and when I cum to him agen
      in th swomp, up thair whair th fued was; and such-liek tiems; and wuud
      allways call me huny, and pet me and do evrything he cuud think of for
      me, and how guud he allways was; and at last I struk th tiem I saevd him
      bi teling th men we had small-pox abord, and he was so graetful, and
      sed I was th best frend oeld Jim ever had in th werld, and th <i>oenly</i>
      wun he’s got now; and then I hapend to luuk around and see that
      paeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cloez plaes. I tuuk it up, and held it in mi hand. I
      was a-trembling, becauz I’d got to desied, forever, betwixt too
      things, and I knowed it. I studyd a minit, sort of hoelding mi
      breth, and then sez to mieself:
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet, then, I’ll <i>go</i> to hel”—and tore
      it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was awful thauts and awful werds, but thay was sed. And I let
      them stay sed; and never thaut no mor about reforming. I shuvd
      th hoel thing out of mi hed, and sed I wuud taek up wikednes agen,
      which was in mi lien, being brung up to it, and th uther worn’t.
      And for a starter I wuud go to werk and steel Jim out of slaevery
      agen; and if I cuud think up enything wers, I wuud do that, too;
      becauz as long as I was in, and in for guud, I miet as wel go th hoel
      hog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I set to thinking oever how to get at it, and ternd oever sum
      considerabl meny ways in mi miend; and at last fixt up a plan that sooted
      me. So then I tuuk th bairings of a woody ieland that was doun th
      river a pees, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with mi raft
      and went for it, and hid it thair, and then ternd in. I slept th
      niet thru, and got up befor it was liet, and had mi brekfast, and
      puut on mi stor cloeths, and tied up sum uthers and wun thing or anuther
      in a bundl, and tuuk th canoo and cleerd for shor. I landed
      belo whair I jujd was Phelps’s plaes, and hid mi bundl in th
      wuuds, and then fild up th canoo with wauter, and loeded roks into her
      and sunk her whair I cuud fiend her agen when I wonted her, about a
      qorter of a miel belo a litl steem sawmil that was on th bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I struk up th roed, and when I past th mil I see a sien on it,
      “Phelps’s Sawmil,” and when I cum to th farm-houses,
      too or three hundred yards ferther along, I kept mi ies peeld, but didn’t
      see noebody around, tho it was guud dayliet now. But I didn’t
      miend, becauz I didn’t wont to see noebody just yet—I oenly
      wonted to get th lay of th land. Acording to mi plan, I was going to
      tern up thair frum th vilej, not frum belo. So I just tuuk a
      luuk, and shuvd along, straet for toun. Wel, th verry ferst man I see
      when I got thair was th duek. He was stiking up a bil for th
      Royal Nonesuch—three-niet performans—liek that uther tiem.
      Thay had th cheek, them frauds! I was riet on him befor I
      cuud sherk. He luukt astonisht, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hel-<i>lo</i>! Whair’d <i>u</i> cum frum?”
      Then he sez, kiend of glad and eeger, “Whair’s th raft?—got
      her in a guud plaes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, that’s just whut I was going to ask yur graes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he didn’t luuk so joyful, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut was yur iedeea for asking <i>me</i>?” he sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” I sez, “when I see th king in that doggery
      yesterday I sez to mieself, we can’t get him hoem for ours, til he’s
      soberer; so I went a-loafing around toun to puut in th tiem and waet.
      A man up and offerd me ten sents to help him puul a skif oever th
      river and bak to fech a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was
      draging him to th boet, and th man left me a-holt of th roep and went
      behiend him to shuv him along, he was too strong for me and jerkt loos
      and run, and we after him. We didn’t hav no daug, and so we
      had to chaes him all oever th cuntry til we tierd him out. We
      never got him til dark; then we fetched him oever, and I started doun for
      th raft. When I got thair and see it was gon, I sez to mieself,
      ’Thay’ve got into trubl and had to leev; and thay’ve
      tuuk mi nigger, which is th oenly nigger I’ve got in th werld, and
      now I’m in a straenj cuntry, and ain’t got no property no
      mor, nor nuthing, and no way to maek mi living;’ so I set doun and
      cried. I slept in th wuuds all niet. But whut <i>did</i>
      becum of th raft, then?—and Jim—pur Jim!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Blaemd if I noe—that is, whut’s becum of th raft.
      That oeld fool had maed a traed and got forty dolars, and when we
      found him in th doggery th loefers had macht haf-dolars with him and
      got evry sent but whut he’d spent for whisky; and when I got him
      hoem laet last niet and found th raft gon, we sed, ‘That litl
      rascal has stoel our raft and shuuk us, and run off doun th river.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wouldn’t shaek mi <i>nigger</i>, wuud I?—th oenly
      nigger I had in th werld, and th oenly property.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We never thaut of that. Fact is, I rekon we’d cum
      to consider him <i>our</i> nigger; yes, we did consider him so—guudnes
      noes we had trubl enuf for him. So when we see th raft was
      gon and we flat broek, thair worn’t enything for it but to tri th
      Royal Nonesuch anuther shaek. And I’ve pegd along ever sinss, dri
      as a pouder-horn. Whair’s that ten sents? Giv it heer.”

    </p>
    <p>
      I had considerabl muny, so I giv him ten sents, but begd him to spend
      it for sumthing to eet, and giv me sum, becauz it was all th muny I
      had, and I hadn’t had nuthing to eet sinss yesterday. He never
      sed nuthing. Th next minit he wherls on me and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do u rekon that nigger wuud blo on us? We’d skin
      him if he dun that!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How can he blo? Hain’t he run off?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No! That oeld fool soeld him, and never divieded with me, and
      th muny’s gon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Soeld</i> him?” I sez, and begun to cri; “whi,
      he was <i>mi</i> nigger, and that was mi muny. Whair is he?—I
      wont mi nigger.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, u can’t <i>get</i> yur nigger, that’s all—so
      dri up yur blubbering. Luuky heer—do u think <i>u’d</i>
      vencher to blo on us? Blaemd if I think I’d trust u. Whi,
      if u <i>was</i> to blo on us—”
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopt, but I never see th duek luuk so ugly out of his ies befor.
      I went on a-whimpering, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t wont to blo on noebody; and I ain’t got no tiem
      to blo, nohow. I got to tern out and fiend mi nigger.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He luukt kiender botherd, and stuud thair with his bils flutering on
      his arm, thinking, and rinkling up his forhed. At last he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll tel u sumthing. We got to be heer three days.
      If u’ll promis u wun’t blo, and wun’t let
      th nigger blo, I’ll tel u whair to fiend him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So I promist, and he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “A farmer bi th naem of Silas Ph—” and then he stopt.
      U see, he started to tel me th trooth; but when he stopt that
      way, and begun to study and think agen, I rekond he was chaenjing his
      miend. And so he was. He wouldn’t trust me; he wonted to maek
      shur of having me out of th way th hoel three days. So prity
      soon he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th man that baut him is naemd Abram Foster—Abram G. Foster—and
      he lievs forty miel bak heer in th cuntry, on th roed to Lafayette.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet,” I sez, “I can wauk it in three days.
      And I’ll start this verry afternoon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No u wont, u’ll start <i>now</i>; and don’t u
      looz eny tiem about it, neether, nor do eny gabling bi th way. Just
      keep a tiet tung in yur hed and moov riet along, and then u wun’t
      get into trubl with <i>us</i>, d’ye heer?”
    </p>
    <p>
      That was th order I wonted, and that was th wun I playd for. I
      wonted to be left free to werk mi plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So cleer out,” he sez; “and u can tel Mr. Foster
      whutever u wont to. Maybe u can get him to beleev that Jim <i>is</i>
      yur nigger—sum idiots don’t reqier docuements—leastways
      I’ve herd thair’s such doun South heer. And when u

      So I left, and struk for th bak cuntry. I didn’t luuk
      around, but I kiender felt liek he was woching me. But I knowed I
      cuud tier him out at that. I went straet out in th cuntry as
      much as a miel befor I stopt; then I dubld bak thru th wuuds
      tords Phelps’. I rekond I beter start in on mi plan
      straet off without fooling around, becauz I wonted to stop Jim’s

      wonted to get entierly shut of them.

      outsied of th fens a garden and a wautermelon pach; then th coton
      feelds begins, and after th feelds th wuuds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went around and clumb oever th bak stiel bi th ash-hoper, and started
      for th kichen. When I got a litl ways I herd th dim hum of a
      spining-wheel waeling along up and sinking along doun agen; and then I
      knowed for serten I wisht I was ded—for that <i>is</i> th
      lonesomest sound in th hoel werld.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went riet along, not fixing up eny particuelar plan, but just trusting
      to Providens to puut th riet werds in mi mouth when th tiem cum; for I’d
      noetist that Providens allways did puut th riet werds in mi mouth if I
      left it aloen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got haf-way, ferst wun hound and then anuther got up and went for
      me, and of cors I stopt and faest them, and kept stil. And such
      anuther powwow as thay maed! In a qorter of a minit I was a kiend
      of a hub of a wheel, as u may say—spoeks maed out of daugs—sercl
      of fifteen of them pakt together around me, with thair neks and noezes
      strecht up tords me, a-barking and houling; and mor a-cuming; u
      cuud see them saeling oever fenses and around corners frum everywheres.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nigger wuuman cum tairing out of th kichen with a roeling-pin in her
      hand, singing out, “Begone <i>u</i> Tige! u Spot! begone sah!”
      and she fetched ferst wun and then anuther of them a clip and sent them
      houling, and then th rest foloed; and th next second haf of them cum
      bak, waging thair taels around me, and maeking frends with me. Thair
      ain’t no harm in a hound, nohow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And behiend th wuuman cums a litl nigger gerl and too litl nigger boys
      without enything on but toe-linen sherts, and thay hung on to thair muther’s
      goun, and peeped out frum behiend her at me, bashful, th way thay allways
      do. And heer cums th whiet wuuman runing frum th hous, about
      forty-fiev or fifty yeer oeld, bairheded, and her spining-stik in her
      hand; and behiend her cums her litl whiet children, acting th saem way
      th litl niggers was doing. She was smieling all oever so she cuud
      hardly stand—and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s <i>u</i>, at last!—<i>ain’t</i> it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I out with a “Yes’m” befor I thaut.

    <p>
      She grabd me and hugd me tiet; and then gript me bi boeth hands and
      shuuk and shuuk; and th teers cum in her ies, and run doun oever; and
      she couldn’t seem to hug and shaek enuf, and kept saying, “U
      don’t luuk as much liek yur muther as I rekond u wuud; but law
      sakes, I don’t cair for that, I’m so glad to see u! Deer,
      deer, it duz seem liek I cuud eet u up! Children, it’s
      yur cuzin Tom!—tel him houdy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But thay dukt thair heds, and puut thair finggers in thair mouths, and
      hid behiend her. So she run on:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lize, hery up and get him a hot brekfast riet away—or did
      u get yur brekfast on th boet?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sed I had got it on th boet. So then she started for th hous,
      leding me bi th hand, and th children taging after. When we got
      thair she set me doun in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself doun on a
      litl lo stool in frunt of me, hoelding boeth of mi hands, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now I can hav a <i>guud</i> luuk at u; and, laws-a-me, I’ve
      bin hunggry for it a meny and a meny a tiem, all thees long yeers, and it’s
      cum at last! We bin expecting u a cupl of days and mor. Whut
      kep’ u?—boet get aground?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes’m—she—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t say yes’m—say Ant Sally. Whair’d
      she get aground?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t rietly noe whut to say, becauz I didn’t noe
      whether th boet wuud be cuming up th river or doun. But I go a
      guud deel on instinkt; and mi instinkt sed she wuud be cuming up—frum
      doun tords Orleans. That didn’t help me much, tho; for I didn’t
      noe th naems of bars doun that way. I see I’d got to invent
      a bar, or forget th naem of th wun we got aground on—or—Now
      I struk an iedeea, and fetched it out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It worn’t th grounding—that didn’t keep us bak
      but a litl. We blowed out a silinder-hed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guud graeshus! enybody hert?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No’m. Kild a nigger.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, it’s luky; becauz sumtiems peepl do get hert.
      Too yeers ago last Christmas yur unkl Silas was cuming up frum
      Newrleans on th oeld Lally Ruuk, and she blowed out a silinder-hed and
      cripld a man. And I think he died afterwards. He was a
      Baptist. Yur unkl Silas knowed a family in Baton Roozh that knowed
      his peepl verry wel. Yes, I remember now, he <i>did</i> die. Mortificaeshun
      set in, and thay had to ampuetaet him. But it didn’t saev him. Yes,
      it was mortificaeshun—that was it. He ternd bloo all oever, and
      died in th hoep of a glorius rezerecshun. Thay say he was a siet to
      luuk at. Yur unkl’s bin up to th toun evry day to fech
      u. And he’s gon agen, not mor’n an our ago; he’ll
      be bak eny minit now. U must a met him on th roed, didn’t u?—oeldish
      man, with a—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I didn’t see noebody, Ant Sally. Th boet landed
      just at dayliet, and I left mi bagej on th whorf-boet and went luuking
      around th toun and out a pees in th cuntry, to puut in th tiem and not
      get heer too soon; and so I cum doun th bak way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoo’d u giv th bagej to?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Noebody.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, chield, it ’ll be stoel!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not whair I hid it I rekon it wun’t,” I sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How’d u get yur brekfast so erly on th boet?”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was kiender thin ies, but I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th capten see me standing around, and toeld me I beter hav
      sumthing to eet befor I went ashor; so he tuuk me in th texas to th
      offisers’ lunch, and giv me all I wonted.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was geting so uneezy I couldn’t lisen guud. I had mi miend
      on th children all th tiem; I wonted to get them out to wun sied and
      pump them a litl, and fiend out hoo I was. But I couldn’t get
      no sho, Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so. Prity soon she maed
      th coeld chils streek all doun mi bak, becauz she sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But heer we’re a-runing on this way, and u hain’t
      toeld me a werd about Sis, nor eny of them. Now I’ll rest mi
      werks a litl, and u start up yourn; just tel me <i>evrything</i>—tel
      me all about ’m all evry wun of ’m; and how thay ar, and
      whut thay’re doing, and whut thay toeld u to tel me; and evry
      last thing u can think of.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, I see I was up a stump—and up it guud. Providens had
      stuud bi me this fer all riet, but I was hard and tiet aground now.
      I see it worn’t a bit of ues to tri to go ahed—I’d
      got to thro up mi hand. So I sez to mieself, heer’s anuther
      plaes whair I got to resk th trooth. I oepend mi mouth to begin; but
      she grabd me and husld me in behiend th bed, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heer he cums! Stik yur hed doun loeer—thair, that’ll
      do; u can’t be seen now. Don’t u let on u’re
      heer. I’ll play a joek on him. Children, don’t u say a
      werd.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I see I was in a fix now. But it worn’t no ues to wery; thair
      worn’t nuthing to do but just hoeld stil, and tri and be redy to
      stand frum under when th lietning struk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had just wun litl glimps of th oeld jentlman when he cum in; then
      th bed hid him. Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has he cum?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” sez her huzband.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guud-<i>ness</i> graeshus!” she sez, “whut in th
      warld can hav becum of him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can’t imajin,” sez th oeld jentlman; “and I
      must say it maeks me dredful uneezy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Uneezy!” she sez; “I’m redy to go distracted!
      He <i>must</i> a cum; and u’ve mist him along th roed.
      I <i>noe</i> it’s so—sumthing tels me so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Sally, I <i>couldn’t</i> mis him along th roed—<i>u</i>
      noe that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But o, deer, deer, whut <i>wil</i> Sis say! He must a cum!
      U must a mist him. He—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, don’t distres me eny mor’n I’m allredy
      distrest. I don’t noe whut in th werld to maek of it.
      I’m at mi wit’s end, and I don’t miend
      aknolejing ’t I’m riet doun scaird. But thair’s
      no hoep that he’s cum; for he <i>couldn’t</i> cum and me
      mis him. Sally, it’s terribl—just terribl—sumthing’s
      hapend to th boet, shur!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Silas! Luuk yonder!—up th roed!—ain’t
      that sumbody cuming?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprung to th windo at th hed of th bed, and that giv Mrs. Phelps
      th chans she wonted. She stoopt doun qik at th fuut of th bed
      and giv me a puul, and out I cum; and when he ternd bak frum th
      windo thair she stuud, a-beeming and a-smieling liek a hous afier, and I
      standing prity meek and swety alongsied. Th oeld jentlman staird,
      and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, hoo’s that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoo do u rekon ’t is?”

    <p>
      “I hain’t no iedeea. Hoo <i>is</i> it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s <i>Tom Sawyer!</i>”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bi jings, I moest slumpt thru th flor! But thair worn’t
      no tiem to swop nievs; th oeld man grabd me bi th hand and shuuk, and
      kept on shaeking; and all th tiem how th wuuman did dans around and laf
      and cri; and then how thay boeth did fier off qeschuns about Sid, and
      Mary, and th rest of th trieb.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if thay was joyful, it worn’t nuthing to whut I was; for it was
      liek being born agen, I was so glad to fiend out hoo I was. Wel,
      thay froez to me for too ours; and at last, when mi chin was so tierd it
      couldn’t hardly go eny mor, I had toeld them mor about mi family—I
      meen th Sawyer family—than ever hapend to eny six Sawyer
      familys. And I explaend all about how we blowed out a
      silinder-hed at th mouth of Whiet River, and it tuuk us three days to
      fix it. Which was all riet, and werkt ferst-raet; becauz <i>thay</i>
      didn’t noe but whut it wuud taek three days to fix it. If I’d
      a calld it a bolthead it wuud a dun just as wel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I was feeling prity cumfortabl all doun wun sied, and prity
      uncumfortabl all up th uther. Being Tom Sawyer was eezy and
      cumfortabl, and it stayd eezy and cumfortabl til bi and bi I heer a
      steemboet caufing along doun th river. Then I sez to mieself, s’poez
      Tom Sawyer cums doun on that boet? And s’poez he steps in
      heer eny minit, and sings out mi naem befor I can thro him a wink to
      keep qieet?
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, I couldn’t <i>hav</i> it that way; it wouldn’t do at
      all. I must go up th roed and waylay him. So I toeld th foeks
      I rekond I wuud go up to th toun and fech doun mi bagej. Th
      oeld jentlman was for going along with me, but I sed no, I cuud driev
      th hors mieself, and I druther he wouldn’t taek no trubl about
      me.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I started for toun in th wagon, and when I was haf-way I see a wagon
      cuming, and shur enuf it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopt and waeted til
      he cum along. I sez “Hoeld on!” and it stopt
      alongsied, and his mouth oepend up liek a trunk, and stayd so; and he
      swoloed too or three tiems liek a person that’s got a dri throet,
      and then sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hain’t ever dun u no harm. U noe that. So,
      then, whut u wont to cum bak and haa’nt <i>me</i> for?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hain’t cum bak—I hain’t bin <i>gon</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When he herd mi vois it righted him up sum, but he worn’t qiet
      satisfied yet. He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t u play nuthing on me, becauz I wouldn’t on
      u. Onest injun now, u ain’t a goest?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Onest injun, I ain’t,” I sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel—I—I—wel, that aut to setl it, of
      cors; but I can’t sumhow seem to understand it no way. Luuky
      heer, worn’t u ever merderd <i>at all?</i>”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No. I worn’t ever merderd at all—I playd it on
      them. U cum in heer and feel of me if u don’t beleev me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So he dun it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me agen
      he didn’t noe whut to do. And he wonted to noe all about it
      riet off, becauz it was a grand advencher, and misteerius, and so it hit
      him whair he livd. But I sed, leev it aloen til bi and bi; and
      toeld his driever to waet, and we droev off a litl pees, and I toeld him
      th kiend of a fix I was in, and whut did he rekon we beter do? He
      sed, let him aloen a minit, and don’t disterb him. So he
      thaut and thaut, and prity soon he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s all riet; I’ve got it. Taek mi trunk in
      yur wagon, and let on it’s yur’n; and u tern bak and fool
      along slo, so as to get to th hous about th tiem u aut to; and I’ll
      go tords toun a pees, and taek a fresh start, and get thair a qorter
      or a haf an our after u; and u needn’t let on to noe me at
      ferst.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet; but waet a minit. Thair’s wun mor thing—a
      thing that <i>noebody</i> don’t noe but me. And that is, thair’s
      a nigger heer that I’m a-trieing to steel out of slaevery, and his
      naem is <i>Jim</i>—oeld Mis Watson’s Jim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut! Whi, Jim is—”
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopt and went to studying. I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I noe whut u’ll say. U’ll say it’s
      derty, lo-doun biznes; but whut if it is? I’m lo doun; and
      I’m a-going to steel him, and I wont u keep mum and not let on.
      Wil u?”
    </p>
    <p>
      His ie lit up, and he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll <i>help</i> u steel him!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, I let go all holts then, liek I was shot. It was th moest
      astonishing speech I ever herd—and I’m bound to say Tom
      Sawyer fel considerabl in mi estimaeshun. Oenly I couldn’t
      beleev it. Tom Sawyer a <i>nigger-steeler!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, shuks!” I sez; “u’re joeking.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I ain’t joeking, eether.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then,” I sez, “joeking or no joeking, if u heer
      enything sed about a runaway nigger, don’t forget to remember that
      <i>u</i> don’t noe nuthing about him, and I don’t noe
      nuthing about him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we tuuk th trunk and puut it in mi wagon, and he droev off his way
      and I droev mien. But of cors I forgot all about drieving slo on
      acounts of being glad and fuul of thinking; so I got hoem a heep too
      qik for that length of a trip. Th oeld jentlman was at th dor,
      and he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, this is wunderful! Hooever wuud a thaut it was in
      that mair to do it? I wish we’d a tiemd her. And she
      hain’t sweted a hair—not a hair. It’s wunderful. Whi,
      I wouldn’t taek a hundred dolars for that hors now—I wouldn’t,
      onest; and yet I’d a soeld her for fifteen befor, and thaut
      ’twas all she was werth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s all he sed. He was th innocentest, best oeld soel I
      ever see. But it worn’t serpriezing; becauz he worn’t oenly
      just a farmer, he was a preecher, too, and had a litl wun-hors log
      cherch doun bak of th plantaeshun, which he bilt it himself at his oen
      expens, for a cherch and scoolhous, and never charjd nuthing for his
      preeching, and it was werth it, too. Thair was plenty uther
      farmer-preechers liek that, and dun th saem way, doun South.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about haf an our Tom’s wagon droev up to th frunt stiel, and
      Ant Sally she see it thru th windo, becauz it was oenly about fifty
      yards, and sez:

      “Whi, thair’s sumbody cum! I wunder hoo ’tis?
      Whi, I do beleev it’s a straenjer. Jimy” (that’s
      wun of th children) “run and tel Lize to puut on anuther plaet for
      diner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Evrybody maed a rush for th frunt dor, becauz, of cors, a straenjer
      don’t cum <i>evry</i> yeer, and so he lays oever th yaller-feever,
      for interest, when he duz cum. Tom was oever th stiel and starting
      for th hous; th wagon was spining up th roed for th vilej, and we
      was all buncht in th frunt dor. Tom had his stor cloeths on, and
      an audyens—and that was allways nuts for Tom Sawyer. In them
      sercumstanses it worn’t no trubl to him to thro in an amount of
      stiel that was sootabl. He worn’t a boy to meeky along up
      that yard liek a sheep; no, he cum ca’m and important, liek th
      ram. When he got a-frunt of us he lifts his hat ever so graeshus and
      daenty, liek it was th lid of a box that had buterflies asleep in it and
      he didn’t wont to disterb them, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mr. Archibald Nichols, I prezoom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c33-287" id="c33-287"></a><br> <br>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">
      <img alt="c33-287.jpg (42K)" src="./HuckFinn_files/c33-287.jpg" style="width:100%;"><br>
    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, mi boy,” sez th oeld jentlman, “I’m sorry
      to say ’t yur driever has deseevd u; Nichols’s plaes is
      doun a mater of three miel mor. Cum in, cum in.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom he tuuk a luuk bak oever his shoelder, and sez, “Too laet—he’s
      out of siet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, he’s gon, mi sun, and u must cum in and eet yur
      diner with us; and then we’ll hich up and taek u doun to Nichols’s.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, I <i>can’t</i> maek u so much trubl; I couldn’t
      think of it. I’ll wauk—I don’t miend th distans.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But we wun’t <i>let</i> u wauk—it wouldn’t be
      Suthern hospitality to do it. Cum riet in.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, <i>do</i>,” sez Ant Sally; “it ain’t a bit
      of trubl to us, not a bit in th werld. U must stay. It’s
      a long, dusty three miel, and we can’t let u wauk. And,
      besieds, I’ve allredy toeld ’em to puut on anuther plaet when I
      see u cuming; so u mustn’t disapoint us. Cum riet in
      and maek yurself at hoem.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So Tom he thankt them verry harty and hansum, and let himself be
      perswaeded, and cum in; and when he was in he sed he was a straenjer frum
      Hicksville, Ohio, and his naem was William Thompson—and he maed
      anuther bo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, he run on, and on, and on, maeking up stuf about Hicksville and
      evrybody in it he cuud invent, and I geting a litl nervious, and
      wundering how this was going to help me out of mi scraep; and at last,
      stil tauking along, he reecht oever and kist Ant Sally riet on th
      mouth, and then setld bak agen in his chair cumfortabl, and was going
      on tauking; but she jumpt up and wiept it off with th bak of her hand,
      and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “U owdacious pupy!”
    </p>
    <p>
      He luukt kiend of hert, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m serpriezd at u, m’am.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U’re s’rp—Whi, whut do u rekon I am? I’ve
      a guud noeshun to taek and—Say, whut do u meen bi kising me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He luukt kiend of humbl, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I didn’t meen nuthing, m’am. I didn’t meen
      no harm. I—I—thaut u’d liek it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, u born fool!” She tuuk up th spining stik,
      and it luukt liek it was all she cuud do to keep frum giving him a crak
      with it. “Whut maed u think I’d liek it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I don’t noe. Oenly, thay—thay—toeld me
      u wuud.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Thay</i> toeld u I wuud. Hooever toeld u’s <i>anuther</i>
      loonatic. I never herd th beet of it. Hoo’s <i>thay</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, evrybody. Thay all sed so, m’am.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all she cuud do to hoeld in; and her ies snapt, and her finggers
      werkt liek she wonted to scrach him; and she sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoo’s ‘evrybody’? Out with thair naems, or
      ther’ll be an idiot short.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up and luukt distrest, and fumbld his hat, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m sorry, and I worn’t expecting it. Thay toeld
      me to. Thay all toeld me to. Thay all sed, kis her; and sed
      she’d liek it. Thay all sed it—evry wun of them.
      But I’m sorry, m’am, and I wun’t do it no mor—I
      wun’t, onest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U wun’t, wun’t u? Wel, I sh’d <i>rekon</i>
      u wun’t!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No’m, I’m onest about it; I wun’t ever do it
      agen—til u ask me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Til I <i>ask</i> u! Wel, I never see th beet of it in mi
      born days! I lay u’ll be th Methusalem-numskul of creaeshun
      befor ever I ask u—or th lieks of u.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” he sez, “it duz serpriez me so. I can’t
      maek it out, sumhow. Thay sed u wuud, and I thaut u wuud. But—”
      He stopt and luukt around slo, liek he wisht he cuud run across a
      frendly ie somewheres, and fetched up on th oeld jentlman’s, and
      sez, “Didn’t <i>u</i> think she’d liek me to kis
      her, ser?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, no; I—I—wel, no, I b’lieve I didn’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he luuks on around th saem way to me, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tom, didn’t <i>u</i> think Ant Sally ’d oepen out her
      arms and say, ‘Sid Sawyer—‘”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mi land!” she sez, braeking in and jumping for him, “u
      impuedent yung rascal, to fool a body so—” and was going to
      hug him, but he fended her off, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, not til u’ve askt me ferst.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So she didn’t looz no tiem, but askt him; and hugd him and kist
      him oever and oever agen, and then ternd him oever to th oeld man, and he
      tuuk whut was left. And after thay got a litl qieet agen she
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, deer me, I never see such a serpriez. We worn’t
      luuking for <i>u</i> at all, but oenly Tom. Sis never roet to me
      about enybody cuming but him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s becauz it worn’t <i>intended</i> for eny of us to
      cum but Tom,” he sez; “but I begd and begd, and at th
      last minit she let me cum, too; so, cuming doun th river, me and Tom
      thaut it wuud be a ferst-raet serpriez for him to cum heer to th
      hous ferst, and for me to bi and bi tag along and drop in, and let on to
      be a straenjer. But it was a mistaek, Ant Sally. This ain’t
      no helthy plaes for a straenjer to cum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No—not impuedent whelps, Sid. U aut to had yur jaws
      boxt; I hain’t bin so puut out sinss I don’t noe when.
      But I don’t cair, I don’t miend th terms—I’d
      be wiling to stand a thouzand such joeks to hav u heer. Wel, to think
      of that performans! I don’t deni it, I was moest putrified
      with astonishment when u giv me that smak.”

    <p>
      We had diner out in that braud oepen pasej betwixt th hous and th
      kichen; and thair was things enuf on that taebl for seven familys—and
      all hot, too; nun of yur flaby, tuf meet that’s laed in a
      cubord in a damp selar all niet and taests liek a hunk of oeld coeld
      canibal in th morning. Unkl Silas he askt a prity long blesing
      oever it, but it was werth it; and it didn’t cool it a bit, neether,
      th way I’ve seen them kiend of interupshuns do lots of tiems.
      Thair was a considerabl guud deel of tauk all th afternoon, and me
      and Tom was on th luukout all th tiem; but it worn’t no ues, thay
      didn’t hapen to say nuthing about eny runaway nigger, and we was
      afraed to tri to werk up to it. But at super, at niet, wun of th
      litl boys sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Paa, mayn’t Tom and Sid and me go to th sho?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” sez th oeld man, “I rekon thair ain’t
      going to be eny; and u couldn’t go if thair was; becauz th
      runaway nigger toeld Burton and me all about that scandalus sho, and
      Burton sed he wuud tel th peepl; so I rekon thay’ve droev th
      owdacious loefers out of toun befor this tiem.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So thair it was!—but I couldn’t help it. Tom and me was
      to sleep in th saem room and bed; so, being tierd, we bid guud-niet and
      went up to bed riet after super, and clumb out of th windo and doun
      th lietning-rod, and shuvd for th toun; for I didn’t beleev
      enybody was going to giv th king and th duek a hint, and so if I didn’t
      hery up and giv them wun thay’d get into trubl shur.
    </p>
    <p>
      On th roed Tom he toeld me all about how it was rekond I was merderd,
      and how pap disapeerd prity soon, and didn’t cum bak no mor,
      and whut a ster thair was when Jim run away; and I toeld Tom all about our
      Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of th raft voyej as I had tiem
      to; and as we struk into th toun and up thru th th midl of it--it
      was as much as haf-after aet, then—heer cums a raejing rush of
      peepl with torches, and an awful hooping and yeling, and banging tin
      pans and bloeing horns; and we jumpt to wun sied to let them go bi; and
      as thay went bi I see thay had th king and th duek astraddle of a rael—that
      is, I knowed it <i>was</i> th king and th duek, tho thay was all oever
      tar and fethers, and didn’t luuk liek nuthing in th werld that was
      hueman—just luukt liek a cupl of monstrus big soeljer-plumes.
      Wel, it maed me sik to see it; and I was sorry for them pur
      pityful rascals, it seemd liek I couldn’t ever feel eny hardnes
      agenst them eny mor in th werld. It was a dredful thing to see.
      Hueman beings <i>can</i> be awful crooel to wun anuther.

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      We see we was too laet—couldn’t do no guud. We askt
      sum straglers about it, and thay sed evrybody went to th sho luuking
      verry inosent; and laed lo and kept dark til th pur oeld king was in
      th midl of his cavortings on th staej; then sumbody giv a signal,
      and th hous roez up and went for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we poekt along bak hoem, and I worn’t feeling so brash as I was
      befor, but kiend of ornery, and humbl, and to blaem, sumhow—tho
      I hadn’t dun nuthing. But that’s allways th way; it don’t
      maek no diferens whether u do riet or rong, a person’s
      conshens ain’t got no sens, and just goes for him enyway. If
      I had a yaller daug that didn’t noe no mor than a person’s
      conshens duz I wuud pison him. It taeks up mor room than all th rest
      of a person’s insieds, and yet ain’t no guud, nohow. Tom
      Sawyer he sez th saem.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXIV.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stopt tauking, and got to thinking. Bi and bi Tom sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Luuky heer, Huck, whut fools we ar to not think of it befor!
      I bet I noe whair Jim is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No! Whair?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In that hut doun bi th ash-hoper. Whi, luuky heer. When
      we was at diner, didn’t u see a nigger man go in thair with sum
      vittles?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut did u think th vittles was for?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For a daug.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So ’d I. Wel, it wasn’t for a daug.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Becauz part of it was wautermelon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So it was—I noetist it. Wel, it duz beet all that I
      never thaut about a daug not eeting wautermelon. It shoes how a body
      can see and don’t see at th saem tiem.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, th nigger unlokt th padlok when he went in, and he
      lokt it agen when he caem out. He fetched unkl a kee about th
      tiem we got up frum taebl—saem kee, I bet. Wautermelon shoes
      man, lok shoes prizoner; and it ain’t liekly thair’s too
      prizoners on such a litl plantaeshun, and whair th peepl’s all so
      kiend and guud. Jim’s th prizoner. All riet—I’m
      glad we found it out detectiv fashun; I wouldn’t giv shuks for
      eny uther way. Now u werk yur miend, and study out a plan to steel
      Jim, and I wil study out wun, too; and we’ll taek th wun we liek
      th best.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Whut a hed for just a boy to hav! If I had Tom Sawyer’s hed
      I wouldn’t traed it off to be a duek, nor maet of a steemboet, nor
      cloun in a sercus, nor nuthing I can think of. I went to thinking
      out a plan, but oenly just to be doing sumthing; I knowed verry wel whair
      th riet plan was going to cum frum. Prity soon Tom sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Redy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” I sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet—bring it out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mi plan is this,” I sez. “We can eezy fiend out if it’s
      Jim in thair. Then get up mi canoo to-morro niet, and fech mi raft oever
      frum th ieland. Then th ferst dark niet that cums steel th kee
      out of th oeld man’s briches after he goes to bed, and shuv off
      doun th river on th raft with Jim, hieding daytimes and runing niets,
      th way me and Jim uezd to do befor. Wouldn’t that plan werk?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Werk</i>? Whi, cert’nly it wuud werk, liek rats
      a-fieting. But it’s too blaem’ simpl; thair ain’t
      nuthing <i>to</i> it. Whut’s th guud of a plan that ain’t
      no mor trubl than that? It’s as mield as goos-milk. Whi,
      Huck, it wouldn’t maek no mor tauk than braeking into a soep
      factory.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I never sed nuthing, becauz I worn’t expecting nuthing diferent;
      but I knowed miety wel that whenever he got <i>his</i> plan redy it
      wouldn’t hav nun of them objecshuns to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it didn’t. He toeld me whut it was, and I see in a minit
      it was werth fifteen of mien for stiel, and wuud maek Jim just as free a
      man as mien wuud, and maybe get us all kild besieds. So I was
      satisfied, and sed we wuud wallts in on it. I needn’t tel
      whut it was heer, becauz I knowed it wouldn’t stay th way, it was.
      I knowed he wuud be chaenjing it around evry which way as we went
      along, and heeving in nue bullinesses whairever he got a chans. And
      that is whut he dun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, wun thing was ded shur, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in
      ernest, and was actuly going to help steel that nigger out of slaevery.
      That was th thing that was too meny for me. Heer was a boy that was
      respectabl and wel brung up; and had a carracter to looz; and foeks at
      hoem that had carracters; and he was briet and not lether-heded; and
      noeing and not ignorant; and not meen, but kiend; and yet heer he was,
      without eny mor pried, or rietnes, or feeling, than to stoop to this
      biznes, and maek himself a shaem, and his family a shaem, befor
      evrybody. I <i>couldn’t</i> understand it no way at all.
      It was outraejus, and I knowed I aut to just up and tel him so;
      and so be his troo frend, and let him qit th thing riet whair he was
      and saev himself. And I <i>did</i> start to tel him; but he shut me up,
      and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t u rekon I noe whut I’m about? Don’t
      I generly noe whut I’m about?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Didn’t I <i>say</i> I was going to help steel th nigger?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Wel</i>, then.”
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s all he sed, and that’s all I sed. It worn’t
      no ues to say eny mor; becauz when he sed he’d do a thing, he
      allways dun it. But I couldn’t maek out how he was wiling to
      go into this thing; so I just let it go, and never botherd no mor about
      it. If he was bound to hav it so, I couldn’t help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got hoem th hous was all dark and stil; so we went on doun to
      th hut bi th ash-hoper for to examin it. We went thru th
      yard so as to see whut th hounds wuud do. Thay knowed us, and didn’t
      maek no mor noiz than cuntry daugs is allways doing when enything cums
      bi in th niet. When we got to th cabin we tuuk a luuk at th
      frunt and th too sieds; and on th sied I worn’t aqaented with—which
      was th north sied—we found a sqair windo-hoel, up tolerabl hi,
      with just wun stout bord naeld across it. I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heer’s th tiket. This hoel’s big enuf for Jim
      to get thru if we rench off th bord.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s as simpl as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-ro, and as eezy as
      playing hooky. I shuud <i>hoep</i> we can fiend a way that’s a
      litl mor complicaeted than <i>that</i>, Huck Finn.”

      “Wel, then,” I sez, “how ’ll it do to saw him
      out, th way I dun befor I was merderd that tiem?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s mor <i>liek</i>,” he sez. “It’s
      reeal misteerius, and trublsum, and guud,” he sez; “but I
      bet we can fiend a way that’s twies as long. Thair ain’t
      no hery; le’s keep on luuking around.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Betwixt th hut and th fens, on th bak sied, was a leen-to that joind
      th hut at th eevs, and was maed out of plank. It was as long as
      th hut, but narro—oenly about six fuut wied. Th dor to it
      was at th south end, and was padlokt. Tom he went to th
      soep-ketl and sercht around, and fetched bak th ieern thing thay lift
      th lid with; so he tuuk it and priezd out wun of th staepls. Th
      chaen fel doun, and we oepend th dor and went in, and shut it, and
      struk a mach, and see th shed was oenly bilt agenst a cabin and hadn’t
      no conecshun with it; and thair worn’t no flor to th shed, nor
      nuthing in it but sum oeld rusty playd-out hoes and spaeds and piks and
      a cripld plow. Th mach went out, and so did we, and shuvd in
      th staepl agen, and th dor was lokt as guud as ever. Tom was joyful.
      He sez;
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now we’re all riet. We’ll <i>dig</i> him out.
      It ’ll taek about a week!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we started for th hous, and I went in th bak dor—u oenly
      hav to puul a bukskin lach-string, thay don’t fasen th dors—but
      that worn’t romantical enuf for Tom Sawyer; no way wuud do him
      but he must cliem up th lietning-rod. But after he got up haf way
      about three tiems, and mist fier and fel evry tiem, and th last tiem
      moest busted his braens out, he thaut he’d got to giv it up; but
      after he was rested he alowd he wuud giv her wun mor tern for luk,
      and this tiem he maed th trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      In th morning we was up at braek of day, and doun to th nigger cabins to
      pet th daugs and maek frends with th nigger that fed Jim—if it <i>was</i>
      Jim that was being fed. Th niggers was just geting thru
      brekfast and starting for th feelds; and Jim’s nigger was pieling
      up a tin pan with bred and meet and things; and whilst th uthers was
      leeving, th kee cum frum th hous.
    </p>
    <p>
      This nigger had a guud-naecherd, chukl-heded faes, and his wuul was all
      tied up in litl bunches with thred. That was to keep wiches off.
      He sed th wiches was pestering him awful thees niets, and maeking
      him see all kiends of straenj things, and heer all kiends of straenj werds
      and noizes, and he didn’t beleev he was ever witched so long befor
      in his lief. He got so werkt up, and got to runing on so about his
      trubls, he forgot all about whut he’d bin a-going to do. So
      Tom sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut’s th vittles for? Going to feed th daugs?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Th nigger kiend of smield around grajualy oever his faes, liek when u
      heev a brikbat in a mud-pudl, and he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Mars Sid, A daug. Cur’us daug, too. Duz u
      wont to go en luuk at ’im?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I huncht Tom, and whispers:
    </p>
    <p>
      “U going, riet heer in th daybraek? <i>that</i> worn’t
      th plan.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, it worn’t; but it’s th plan <i>now</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So, drat him, we went along, but I didn’t liek it much. When
      we got in we couldn’t hardly see enything, it was so dark; but Jim
      was thair, shur enuf, and cuud see us; and he sings out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, <i>Huck</i>! En guud <i>lan</i>’! ain’ dat
      Misto Tom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I just knowed how it wuud be; I just expected it. I didn’t
      noe nuthing to do; and if I had I couldn’t a dun it, becauz that
      nigger busted in and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, de graeshus sakes! do he noe u genlmen?”
    </p>
    <p>
      We cuud see prity wel now. Tom he luukt at th nigger, stedy
      and kiend of wundering, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Duz <i>hoo</i> noe us?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, dis-yer runaway nigger.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t rekon he duz; but whut puut that into yur hed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut <i>puut</i> it dar? Didn’ he jis’ dis minit
      sing out liek he knowed u?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom sez, in a puzld-up kiend of way:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, that’s miety cuerius. <i>Hoo</i> sung out? <i>when</i>
      did he sing out? <i>whut</i> did he sing out?” And terns to
      me, perfectly ca’m, and sez, “Did <i>u</i> heer enybody
      sing out?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Of cors thair worn’t nuthing to be sed but th wun thing; so I
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; I ain’t herd noebody say nuthing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he terns to Jim, and luuks him oever liek he never see him befor, and
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did u sing out?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sah,” sez Jim; “I hain’t sed nuthing, sah.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not a werd?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sah, I hain’t sed a werd.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did u ever see us befor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sah; not as I noes on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So Tom terns to th nigger, which was luuking wield and distrest, and
      sez, kiend of seveer:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut do u rekon’s th mater with u, enyway? Whut
      maed u think sumbody sung out?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, it’s de dad-blaem’ wiches, sah, en I wisht I was
      ded, I do. Day’s awluz at it, sah, en day do mos’ kil
      me, day sk’yers me so. Pleez to don’t tel noebody
      ’bout it sah, er oelay Mars Silas he’ll scole me; ’kase he
      say day <i>ain’t</i> no wiches. I jis’ wish to guudnes
      he was heah now—<i>den</i> whut wuud he say! I jis’ bet
      he couldn’ fien no way to git aroun’ it <i>dis</i> tiem.
      But it’s awluz jis’ so; peepl dat’s <i>sot</i>,
      stays sot; day wun’t luuk into noth’n’en fien it out f’r
      deyselves, en when <i>u</i> fien it out en tel um ’bout it, day

      Tom giv him a diem, and sed we wouldn’t tel noebody; and toeld him
      to bi sum mor thred to tee up his wuul with; and then luuks at Jim,
      and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wunder if Unkl Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I
      was to cach a nigger that was ungraetful enuf to run away, I wouldn’t
      giv him up, I’d hang him.” And whilst th nigger
      stept to th dor to luuk at th diem and biet it to see if it was guud,
      he whispers to Jim and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t ever let on to noe us. And if u heer eny
      diging going on niets, it’s us; we’re going to set u free.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim oenly had tiem to grab us bi th hand and sqeez it; then th nigger
      cum bak, and we sed we’d cum agen sum tiem if th nigger
      wonted us to; and he sed he wuud, mor particuelar if it was dark,
      becauz th wiches went for him moestly in th dark, and it was guud to
      hav foeks around then.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXV.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wuud be moest an our yet til brekfast, so we left and struk doun
      into th wuuds; becauz Tom sed we got to hav <i>sum</i> liet to see
      how to dig bi, and a lantern maeks too much, and miet get us into
      trubl; whut we must hav was a lot of them roten chunks that’s
      calld fox-fier, and just maeks a sofft kiend of a glo when u lay them in
      a dark plaes. We fetched an armful and hid it in th weeds, and set
      doun to rest, and Tom sez, kiend of dissatisfied:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Blaem it, this hoel thing is just as eezy and aukward as it can
      be. And so it maeks it so roten dificult to get up a dificult plan.
      Thair ain’t no wochman to be drugd—now thair <i>aut</i>
      to be a wochman. Thair ain’t eeven a daug to giv a
      sleeping-mixcher to. And thair’s Jim chained bi wun leg, with
      a ten-fuut chaen, to th leg of his bed: whi, all u got to do is
      to lift up th bedsted and slip off th chaen. And Unkl Silas he
      trusts evrybody; sends th kee to th punkin-heded nigger, and don’t
      send noebody to woch th nigger. Jim cuud a got out of that
      windo-hoel befor this, oenly thair wouldn’t be no ues trieing to
      travel with a ten-fuut chaen on his leg. Whi, drat it, Huck, it’s
      th stoopidest araenjment I ever see. U got to invent <i>all</i> th
      dificultys. Wel, we can’t help it; we got to do th best we
      can with th mateerials we’ve got. Enyhow, thair’s wun thing—thair’s
      mor onor in geting him out thru a lot of dificultys and daenjers,
      whair thair worn’t wun of them fernisht to u bi th peepl hoo it
      was thair duety to fernish them, and u had to contriev them all out of
      yur oen hed. Now luuk at just that wun thing of th lantern.
      When u cum doun to th coeld facts, we simply got to <i>let on</i>
      that a lantern’s resky. Whi, we cuud werk with a torchliet
      proseshun if we wonted to, I beleev. Now, whilst I think of it, we
      got to hunt up sumthing to maek a saw out of th ferst chans we get.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut do we wont of a saw?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut do we <i>wont</i> of it? Hain’t we got to saw th
      leg of Jim’s bed off, so as to get th chaen loos?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, u just sed a body cuud lift up th bedsted and slip th
      chaen off.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, if that ain’t just liek u, Huck Finn. U <i>can</i>
      get up th infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. Whi, hain’t
      u ever red eny buuks at all?—Barron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor
      Benvenuto Chelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor nun of them heeroes? Hoo
      ever herd of geting a prizoner loos in such an oeld-maidy way as that?
      No; th way all th best authoritys duz is to saw th bed-leg in
      too, and leev it just so, and swolo th sawdust, so it can’t be
      found, and puut sum dert and grees around th sawd plaes so th verry
      keenest seneskal can’t see no sien of it’s being sawd, and
      thinks th bed-leg is perfectly sound. Then, th niet u’re redy,
      fech th leg a kik, doun she goes; slip off yur chaen, and thair u
      ar. Nuthing to do but hich yur roep lader to th batlments,
      shin doun it, braek yur leg in th moet—becauz a roep lader is
      nienteen fuut too short, u noe—and thair’s yur horses and
      yur trusty vassles, and thay scoop u up and fling u across a sadl,
      and away u go to yur naetiv Langudoc, or Navarre, or whairever it is. It’s
      gaudy, Huck. I wish thair was a moet to this cabin. If we get tiem,
      th niet of th escaep, we’ll dig wun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut do we wont of a moet when we’re going to snaek him out
      frum under th cabin?”
    </p>
    <p>
      But he never herd me. He had forgot me and evrything els. He
      had his chin in his hand, thinking. Prity soon he sies and shaeks
      his hed; then sies agen, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, it wouldn’t do—thair ain’t nesesity enuf
      for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For whut?” I sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, to saw Jim’s leg off,” he sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guud land!” I sez; “whi, thair ain’t <i>no</i>
      nesesity for it. And whut wuud u wont to saw his leg off for,
      enyway?”

      “Wel, sum of th best authoritys has dun it. Thay couldn’t
      get th chaen off, so thay just cut thair hand off and shuvd. And a
      leg wuud be beter stil. But we got to let that go. Thair
      ain’t nesesity enuf in this caes; and, besieds, Jim’s a
      nigger, and wouldn’t understand th reezons for it, and how it’s
      th custom in Europe; so we’ll let it go. But thair’s
      wun thing—he can hav a roep lader; we can teer up our sheets and
      maek him a roep lader eezy enuf. And we can send it to him in a

    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Tom Sawyer, how u tauk,” I sez; “Jim ain’t
      got no ues for a roep lader.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He <i>has</i> got ues for it. How <i>u</i> tauk, u beter
      say; u don’t noe nuthing about it. He’s <i>got</i> to
      hav a roep lader; thay all do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut in th naeshun can he <i>do</i> with it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Do</i> with it? He can hied it in his bed, can’t he?”
      That’s whut thay all do; and <i>he’s</i> got to, too.
      Huck, u don’t ever seem to wont to do enything that’s
      reguelar; u wont to be starting sumthing fresh all th tiem. S’poez
      he <i>don’t</i> do nuthing with it? ain’t it thair in his bed,
      for a cloo, after he’s gon? and don’t u rekon thay’ll
      wont clews? Of cors thay wil. And u wouldn’t leev
      them eny? That wuud be a <i>prity</i> houdy-do, <i>wouldn’t</i>
      it! I never herd of such a thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” I sez, “if it’s in th reguelaeshuns, and
      he’s got to hav it, all riet, let him hav it; becauz I don’t
      wish to go bak on no reguelaeshuns; but thair’s wun thing, Tom Sawyer—if
      we go to tairing up our sheets to maek Jim a roep lader, we’re
      going to get into trubl with Ant Sally, just as shur as u’re
      born. Now, th way I luuk at it, a hickry-bark lader don’t
      cost nuthing, and don’t waest nuthing, and is just as guud to loed
      up a pi with, and hied in a straw tik, as eny rag lader u can start;
      and as for Jim, he ain’t had no expeeryens, and so he don’t
      cair whut kiend of a—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, shuks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as u I’d keep
      stil—that’s whut I’D do. Hoo ever herd of a

    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, all riet, Tom, fix it yur oen way; but if u’ll taek
      mi advies, u’ll let me borro a sheet off of th cloethslien.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He sed that wuud do. And that gaev him anuther iedeea, and he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Borro a shert, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut do we wont of a shert, Tom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wont it for Jim to keep a jernal on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Jernal yur grany—<i>Jim</i> can’t riet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “S’poez he <i>can’t</i> riet—he can maek marks on

      or a pees of an oeld ieern barrel-hoop?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Tom, we can puul a fether out of a goos and maek him a

    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Prizoners</i> don’t hav gees runing around th

      maek thair pens out of th hardest, tufest, troublesomest pees of oeld

      it taeks them weeks and weeks and munths and munths to fiel it out, too,
      becauz thay’ve got to do it bi rubing it on th wall. <i>Thay</i>
      wouldn’t ues a goos-qil if thay had it. It ain’t reguelar.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, whut’ll we maek him th ink out of?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Meny maeks it out of ieern-rust and teers; but that’s th
      comon sort and wimen; th best authoritys uezes thair oen blud. Jim
      can do that; and when he wonts to send eny litl comon ordinairy

      can riet it on th botom of a tin plaet with a fork and thro it out of

      “Jim ain’t got no tin plates. Thay feed him in a pan.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That ain’t nuthing; we can get him sum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can’t noebody <i>red</i> his plates.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That ain’t got enything to <i>do</i> with it, Huck Finn.
      All <i>he’s</i> got to do is to riet on th plaet and thro
      it out. U don’t <i>hav</i> to be aebl to red it. Whi, haf
      th tiem u can’t red enything a prizoner riets on a tin plaet,
      or enywhair els.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, whut’s th sens in waesting th plates?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, blaem it all, it ain’t th <i>prizoner’s</i>
      plates.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But it’s <i>sumbody’s</i> plates, ain’t it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, spos’n it is? Whut duz th <i>prizoner</i> cair

    </p>
    <p>
      He broek off thair, becauz we herd th brekfast-horn bloeing. So

      Along during th morning I borroed a sheet and a whiet shert off of th
      cloeths-lien; and I found an oeld sak and puut them in it, and we went doun
      and got th fox-fier, and puut that in too. I calld it borroeing,
      becauz that was whut pap allways calld it; but Tom sed it worn’t
      borroeing, it was steeling. He sed we was reprezenting prizoners;
      and prizoners don’t cair how thay get a thing so thay get it, and
      noebody don’t blaem them for it, eether. It ain’t no
      criem in a prizoner to steel th thing he needs to get away with, Tom
      sed; it’s his riet; and so, as long as we was reprezenting a
      prizoner, we had a perfect riet to steel enything on this plaes we had
      th leest ues for to get ourselvs out of prizon with. He sed if we
      worn’t prizoners it wuud be a verry diferent thing, and noebody but
      a meen, ornery person wuud steel when he worn’t a prizoner. So
      we alowd we wuud steel evrything thair was that cum handy. And
      yet he maed a miety fus, wun day, after that, when I stoel a wautermelon
      out of th nigger-pach and eet it; and he maed me go and giv th niggers
      a diem without teling them whut it was for. Tom sed that whut he ment
      was, we cuud steel enything we <i>needed</i>. Wel, I sez, I needed th
      wautermelon. But he sed I didn’t need it to get out of prizon
      with; thair’s whair th diferens was. He sed if I’d a
      wonted it to hied a nief in, and smugl it to Jim to kil th seneskal
      with, it wuud a bin all riet. So I let it go at that, tho I
      couldn’t see no advantej in mi reprezenting a prizoner if I got to
      set doun and chaw oever a lot of goeld-leef distinkshuns liek that evry
      tiem I see a chans to hog a wautermelon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, as I was saying, we waeted that morning til evrybody was setld
      doun to biznes, and noebody in siet around th yard; then Tom he carryd
      th sak into th leen-to whilst I stuud off a pees to keep woch. Bi
      and bi he cum out, and we went and set doun on th wuudpiel to tauk.
      He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Evrything’s all riet now exsept tools; and that’s
      eezy fixt.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tools?” I sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tools for whut?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, to dig with. We ain’t a-going to <i>naw</i> him
      out, ar we?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ain’t them oeld cripld piks and things in thair guud enuf
      to dig a nigger out with?” I sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      He terns on me, luuking pitying enuf to maek a body cri, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Huck Finn, did u <i>ever</i> heer of a prizoner having piks and
      shuvels, and all th modern conveenyunses in his wordroeb to dig himself
      out with? Now I wont to ask u—if u got eny reasonableness
      in u at all—whut kiend of a sho wuud <i>that</i> giv him to be a
      heero? Whi, thay miet as wel lend him th kee and dun with it.
      Piks and shuvels—whi, thay wouldn’t fernish ’em
      to a king.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then,” I sez, “if we don’t wont th piks
      and shuvels, whut do we wont?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A cupl of caes-nievs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To dig th foundaeshuns out frum under that cabin with?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Confound it, it’s foolish, Tom.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It don’t maek no diferens how foolish it is, it’s th
      <i>riet</i> way—and it’s th reguelar way. And thair ain’t
      no <i>uther</i> way, that ever I herd of, and I’ve red all th
      buuks that givs eny informaeshun about thees things. Thay allways dig out
      with a caes-nief—and not thru dert, miend u; generly it’s
      thru solid rok. And it taeks them weeks and weeks and weeks, and
      for ever and ever. Whi, luuk at wun of them prizoners in th botom
      dunjon of th Casl Deef, in th harbor of Marseilles, that dug himself
      out that way; how long was <i>he</i> at it, u rekon?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t noe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, ges.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t noe. A munth and a haf.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Therty-seven yeer</i>—and he cum out in Chiena. <i>That’s</i>
      th kiend. I wish th botom of <i>this</i> fortres was solid rok.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Jim</i> don’t noe noebody in Chiena.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut’s <i>that</i> got to do with it? Neether did that
      uther felo. But u’re allways a-waandering off on a sied
      ishoo. Whi can’t u stik to th maen point?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet—I don’t cair whair he cums out, so he <i>cums</i>
      out; and Jim don’t, eether, I rekon. But thair’s wun
      thing, enyway—Jim’s too oeld to be dug out with a caes-nief.
      He wun’t last.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes he wil <i>last</i>, too. U don’t rekon it’s
      going to taek therty-seven yeers to dig out thru a <i>dert</i>
      foundaeshun, do u?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How long wil it taek, Tom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, we can’t resk being as long as we aut to, becauz it
      mayn’t taek verry long for Unkl Silas to heer frum doun thair bi Nue
      Orleans. He’ll heer Jim ain’t frum thair. Then his
      next moov wil be to advertiez Jim, or sumthing liek that. So we
      can’t resk being as long diging him out as we aut to. Bi
      riets I rekon we aut to be a cupl of yeers; but we can’t.
      Things being so unsertan, whut I recomend is this: that we
      reealy dig riet in, as qik as we can; and after that, we can <i>let on</i>,
      to ourselvs, that we was at it therty-seven yeers. Then we can
      snach him out and rush him away th ferst tiem thair’s an alarm.
      Yes, I rekon that ’ll be th best way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, thair’s <i>sens</i> in that,” I sez. “Leting
      on don’t cost nuthing; leting on ain’t no trubl; and if it’s
      eny object, I don’t miend leting on we was at it a hundred and fifty
      yeer. It wouldn’t straen me nun, after I got mi hand in.
      So I’ll moezy along now, and smouch a cupl of caes-nievs.”

      “Smouch three,” he sez; “we wont wun to maek a saw out

    </p>
    <p>
      “Tom, if it ain’t unregular and irrelijus to sejest it,”
      I sez, “thair’s an oeld rusty saw-blaed around yonder stiking

    </p>

      He luukt kiend of weery and discurejd-liek, and sez:

    <p>
      “It ain’t no ues to tri to lern u nuthing, Huck. Run
      along and smouch th nievs—three of them.” So I dun

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXVI.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we rekond evrybody was asleep that niet we went doun th
      lietning-rod, and shut ourselvs up in th leen-to, and got out our piel
      of fox-fier, and went to werk. We cleerd evrything out of th way,
      about foer or fiev fuut along th midl of th botom log. Tom sed
      he was riet behiend Jim’s bed now, and we’d dig in under it,
      and when we got thru thair couldn’t noebody in th cabin ever noe
      thair was eny hoel thair, becauz Jim’s counter-pin hung doun moest
      to th ground, and u’d hav to raez it up and luuk under to see
      th hoel. So we dug and dug with th caes-nievs til moest midniet;
      and then we was daug-tierd, and our hands was blisterd, and yet u couldn’t
      see we’d dun enything hardly. At last I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “This ain’t no therty-seven yeer job; this is a therty-aet
      yeer job, Tom Sawyer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He never sed nuthing. But he sied, and prity soon he stopt
      diging, and then for a guud litl whiel I knowed that he was thinking.
      Then he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It ain’t no ues, Huck, it ain’t a-going to werk. If
      we was prizoners it wuud, becauz then we’d hav as meny yeers as
      we wonted, and no hery; and we wouldn’t get but a fue minits to
      dig, evry day, whiel thay was chaenjing woches, and so our hands wouldn’t
      get blisterd, and we cuud keep it up riet along, yeer in and yeer out,
      and do it riet, and th way it aut to be dun. But <i>we</i> can’t
      fool along; we got to rush; we ain’t got no tiem to spair. If
      we was to puut in anuther niet this way we’d hav to nok off for a
      week to let our hands get wel—couldn’t tuch a caes-nief
      with them sooner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, whut we going to do, Tom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll tel u. It ain’t riet, and it ain’t
      moral, and I wouldn’t liek it to get out; but thair ain’t oenly
      just th wun way: we got to dig him out with th piks, and <i>let
      on</i> it’s caes-nievs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Now</i> u’re <i>tauking</i>!” I sez;
      “yur hed gets leveler and leveler all th tiem, Tom Sawyer,”
      I sez. “Piks is th thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don’t
      cair shuks for th morality of it, nohow. When I start in to steel
      a nigger, or a wautermelon, or a Sunday-scool buuk, I ain’t no ways
      particuelar how it’s dun so it’s dun. Whut I wont is mi
      nigger; or whut I wont is mi wautermelon; or whut I wont is mi
      Sunday-scool buuk; and if a pik’s th handyest thing, that’s
      th thing I’m a-going to dig that nigger or that wautermelon or that
      Sunday-scool buuk out with; and I don’t giv a ded rat whut th
      authoritys thinks about it nuther.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” he sez, “thair’s excues for piks and
      leting-on in a caes liek this; if it worn’t so, I wouldn’t
      aproov of it, nor I wouldn’t stand bi and see th rools broek—becauz
      riet is riet, and rong is rong, and a body ain’t got no biznes
      doing rong when he ain’t ignorant and noes beter. It miet
      anser for <i>u</i> to dig Jim out with a pik, <i>without</i> eny
      leting on, becauz u don’t noe no beter; but it wouldn’t
      for me, becauz I do noe beter. Gimme a caes-nief.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He had his oen bi him, but I handed him mien. He flung it doun, and
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gimme a <i>caes-nief</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t noe just whut to do—but then I thaut. I
      scracht around amungst th oeld tools, and got a pikax and giv it to
      him, and he tuuk it and went to werk, and never sed a werd.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was allways just that particuelar. Fuul of prinsipl.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then I got a shuvel, and then we pikt and shuveld, tern about, and
      maed th fer fli. We stuk to it about a haf an our, which was as
      long as we cuud stand up; but we had a guud deel of a hoel to sho for
      it. When I got up stairs I luukt out at th windo and see Tom doing his
      level best with th lietning-rod, but he couldn’t cum it, his
      hands was so sor. At last he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It ain’t no ues, it can’t be dun. Whut u
      rekon I beter do? Can’t u think of no way?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” I sez, “but I rekon it ain’t reguelar.
      Cum up th stairs, and let on it’s a lietning-rod.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So he dun it.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day Tom stoel a pueter spoon and a bras candlstik in th hous,
      for to maek sum pens for Jim out of, and six talo candls; and I hung
      around th nigger cabins and laed for a chans, and stoel three tin
      plates. Tom sez it wasn’t enuf; but I sed noebody wouldn’t
      ever see th plates that Jim throwed out, becauz thay’d fall in th
      daug-fenel and jimpson weeds under th windo-hoel—then we cuud
      toet them bak and he cuud ues them oever agen. So Tom was
      satisfied. Then he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, th thing to study out is, how to get th things to Jim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Taek them in thru th hoel,” I sez, “when we get it
      dun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He oenly just luukt scornful, and sed sumthing about noebody ever herd
      of such an idiotic iedeea, and then he went to studying. Bi and bi he
      sed he had ciphered out too or three ways, but thair worn’t no need
      to desied on eny of them yet. Sed we’d got to poest Jim ferst.
    </p>
    <p>
      That niet we went doun th lietning-rod a litl after ten, and tuuk wun
      of th candls along, and lisend under th windo-hoel, and herd Jim
      snoring; so we picht it in, and it didn’t waek him. Then we
      wherld in with th pik and shuvel, and in about too ours and a haf th
      job was dun. We crept in under Jim’s bed and into th cabin,
      and pawed around and found th candl and lit it, and stuud oever Jim
      awhiel, and found him luuking harty and helthy, and then we woek him up
      jentl and grajual. He was so glad to see us he moest cried; and
      calld us huny, and all th pet naems he cuud think of; and was for
      having us hunt up a coeld-chizel to cut th chaen off of his leg with riet
      away, and cleering out without loozing eny tiem. But Tom he shoed
      him how unregular it wuud be, and set doun and toeld him all about our
      plans, and how we cuud allter them in a minit eny tiem thair was an
      alarm; and not to be th leest afraed, becauz we wuud see he got away,
      <i>shur</i>. So Jim he sed it was all riet, and we set thair and
      taukt oever oeld tiems awhiel, and then Tom askt a lot of qeschuns, and
      when Jim toeld him Unkl Silas cum in evry day or too to pray with him,
      and Ant Sally cum in to see if he was cumfortabl and had plenty to eet,
      and boeth of them was kiend as thay cuud be, Tom sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Now</i> I noe how to fix it. We’ll send u sum
      things bi them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sed, “Don’t do nuthing of th kiend; it’s wun of th
      moest jakas iedeeas I ever struk;” but he never paed no atenshun to
      me; went riet on. It was his way when he’d got his plans set.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he toeld Jim how we’d hav to smugl in th roep-lader pi and
      uther larj things bi Nat, th nigger that fed him, and he must be on th
      luukout, and not be serpriezd, and not let Nat see him oepen them; and we
      wuud puut small things in unkl’s coet-pokets and he must steel
      them out; and we wuud tee things to ant’s aepron-strings or puut
      them in her aepron-poket, if we got a chans; and toeld him whut thay wuud
      be and whut thay was for. And toeld him how to keep a jernal on th
      shert with his blud, and all that. He toeld him evrything. Jim he
      couldn’t see no sens in th moest of it, but he alowd we was whiet
      foeks and knowed beter than him; so he was satisfied, and sed he wuud
      do it all just as Tom sed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim had plenty corn-cob pieps and tobaco; so we had a riet doun guud
      soeshabl tiem; then we cralld out thru th hoel, and so hoem to bed,
      with hands that luukt liek thay’d bin chawed. Tom was in
      hi spirits. He sed it was th best fun he ever had in his lief, and th
      moest intellectural; and sed if he oenly cuud see his way to it we wuud
      keep it up all th rest of our lievs and leev Jim to our children to get
      out; for he beleevd Jim wuud cum to liek it beter and beter th mor
      he got uezd to it. He sed that in that way it cuud be strung out
      to as much as aety yeer, and wuud be th best tiem on record. And
      he sed it wuud maek us all selebraeted that had a hand in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In th morning we went out to th wuudpiel and chopt up th bras
      candlstik into handy siezes, and Tom puut them and th pueter spoon in his
      poket. Then we went to th nigger cabins, and whiel I got Nat’s
      noetis off, Tom shuvd a pees of candlstik into th midl of a
      corn-pone that was in Jim’s pan, and we went along with Nat to see
      how it wuud werk, and it just werkt noebl; when Jim bit into it it moest
      masht all his teeth out; and thair worn’t ever enything cuud a
      werkt beter. Tom sed so himself. Jim he never let on but whut it was
      oenly just a pees of rok or sumthing liek that that’s allways
      geting into bred, u noe; but after that he never bit into nuthing but
      whut he jabd his fork into it in three or foer plaeses ferst.
    </p>
    <p>
      And whilst we was a-standing thair in th dimmish liet, heer cums a
      cupl of th hounds buljing in frum under Jim’s bed; and thay kept
      on pieling in til thair was eleven of them, and thair worn’t hardly
      room in thair to get yur breth. Bi jings, we forgot to fasen that
      leen-to dor! Th nigger Nat he oenly just holerd “Wiches”
      wuns, and keeled oever on to th flor amungst th daugs, and begun to groen
      liek he was dieing. Tom jerkt th dor oepen and flung out a slab of
      Jim’s meet, and th daugs went for it, and in too seconds he was out
      himself and bak agen and shut th dor, and I knowed he’d fixt
      th uther dor too. Then he went to werk on th nigger, coexing him and
      peting him, and asking him if he’d bin imajining he saw sumthing
      agen. He raezd up, and blinkt his ies around, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mars Sid, u’ll say I’s a fool, but if I didn’t
      b’lieve I see moest a milyon daugs, er devils, er sum’n, I
      wisht I may die riet heah in dese traks. I did, mos’ sholy.
      Mars Sid, I <i>felt</i> um—I <i>felt</i> um, sah; day was all
      oever me. Dad fech it, I jis’ wisht I cuud git mi han’s
      on wun er dem wiches jis’ wunst—on’y jis’ wunst—it’s
      all I’d ast. But mos’ly I wisht day’d lemme
      ’loen, I duz.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I tel u whut I think. Whut maeks them cum heer just
      at this runaway nigger’s brekfast-tiem? It’s becauz
      thay’re hunggry; that’s th reezon. U maek them a wich
      pi; that’s th thing for <i>u</i> to do.”

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXVII.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all fixt. So then we went away and went to th
      rubbage-piel in th bak yard, whair thay keep th oeld boots, and rags,
      and peeses of botls, and wor-out tin things, and all such truk, and
      scracht around and found an oeld tin washpan, and stopt up th hoels as
      wel as we cuud, to baek th pi in, and tuuk it doun selar and stoel it
      fuul of flour and started for brekfast, and found a cupl of
      shinggl-naels that Tom sed wuud be handy for a prizoner to scrabble his
      naem and sorroes on th dunjon walls with, and dropt wun of them in
      Ant Sally’s aepron-poket which was hanging on a chair, and t’uther
      we stuk in th band of Unkl Silas’s hat, which was on th buero,
      becauz we herd th children say thair paa and maa was going to th runaway
      nigger’s hous this morning, and then went to brekfast, and Tom
      dropt th pueter spoon in Unkl Silas’s coet-poket, and Ant
      Sally wasn’t cum yet, so we had to waet a litl whiel.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when she cum she was hot and red and cross, and couldn’t hardly
      waet for th blesing; and then she went to sloosing out coffy with wun
      hand and craking th handyest chield’s hed with her thimbl with
      th uther, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ve hunted hi and I’ve hunted lo, and it duz beet
      all whut <i>has</i> becum of yur uther shert.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mi hart fel doun amungst mi lungs and livers and things, and a hard
      pees of corn-crust started doun mi throet after it and got met on th
      roed with a cauf, and was shot across th taebl, and tuuk wun of th
      children in th ie and curld him up liek a fishing-werm, and let a cri
      out of him th siez of a warwhoop, and Tom he ternd kiender bloo around
      th gils, and it all amounted to a considerabl staet of things for about
      a qorter of a minit or as much as that, and I wuud a soeld out for haf
      pries if thair was a bider. But after that we was all riet agen—it
      was th suden serpriez of it that nokt us so kiend of coeld. Unkl Silas
      he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s moest uncomon cuerius, I can’t understand it.
      I noe perfectly wel I tuuk it <i>off</i>, becauz—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Becauz u hain’t got but wun <i>on</i>. Just <i>lisen</i>
      at th man! I noe u tuuk it off, and noe it bi a beter way than
      yur wuul-gethering memory, too, becauz it was on th clo’s-lien
      yesterday—I see it thair mieself. But it’s gon, that’s
      th long and th short of it, and u’ll just hav to chaenj to a
      red flann’l wun til I can get tiem to maek a nue wun. And it
      ’ll be th therd I’ve maed in too yeers. It just keeps a
      body on th jump to keep u in sherts; and whutever u do manej to <i>do</i>
      with ’m all is mor’n I can maek out. A body ’d
      think u <i>wuud</i> lern to taek sum sort of cair of ’em at
      yur tiem of lief.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I noe it, Sally, and I do tri all I can. But it oughtn’t
      to be alltogether mi fallt, becauz, u noe, I don’t see them nor
      hav nuthing to do with them exsept when thay’re on me; and I don’t
      beleev I’ve ever lost wun of them <i>off</i> of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, it ain’t <i>yur</i> fallt if u haeven’t, Silas;
      u’d a dun it if u cuud, I rekon. And th shert ain’t
      all that’s gon, nuther. Ther’s a spoon gon; and <i>that</i>
      ain’t all. Thair was ten, and now ther’s oenly nien. Th
      caf got th shert, I rekon, but th caf never tuuk th spoon, <i>that’s</i>
      serten.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, whut els is gon, Sally?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ther’s six <i>candls</i> gon—that’s whut.
      Th rats cuud a got th candls, and I rekon thay did; I wunder
      thay don’t wauk off with th hoel plaes, th way u’re
      allways going to stop thair hoels and don’t do it; and if thay worn’t
      fools thay’d sleep in yur hair, Silas—<i>u’d</i>
      never fiend it out; but u can’t lay th <i>spoon</i> on th rats,
      and that I noe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, Sally, I’m in fallt, and I aknolej it; I’ve
      bin remiss; but I wun’t let to-morro go bi without stoping up
      them hoels.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, I wouldn’t hery; next yeer ’ll do. Matilda
      Angelina Araminta <i>Phelps!</i>”
    </p>
    <p>
      Whak cums th thimbl, and th chield snaches her claws out of th
      shuugar-boel without fooling around eny. Just then th nigger wuuman
      steps on to th pasej, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Missus, day’s a sheet gon.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “A <i>sheet</i> gon! Wel, for th land’s saek!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll stop up them hoels to-day,” sez Unkl Silas,
      luuking sorroeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, <i>do</i> shet up!—s’poez th rats tuuk th <i>sheet</i>?
      <i>whair’s</i> it gon, Lize?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Clah to guudnes I hain’t no noeshun, Mis’ Sally.
      She wuz on de clo’sline yistiddy, but she dun gon: she
      ain’ dah no mo’ now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I rekon th werld <i>is</i> cuming to an end. I <i>never</i>
      see th beet of it in all mi born days. A shert, and a sheet, and a
      spoon, and six can—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Missus,” cums a yung yaller wench, “day’s a
      bras cannelstick mis’n.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cler out frum heer, u husy, er I’ll taek a skilet to ye!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, she was just a-biling. I begun to lay for a chans; I rekond
      I wuud sneek out and go for th wuuds til th wether moderated. She
      kept a-raejing riet along, runing her inserecshun all bi herself, and
      evrybody els miety meek and qieet; and at last Unkl Silas, luuking
      kiend of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his poket. She
      stopt, with her mouth oepen and her hands up; and as for me, I wisht I
      was in Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long, becauz she sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s <i>just</i> as I expected. So u had it in yur
      poket all th tiem; and liek as not u’ve got th uther things
      thair, too. How’d it get thair?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I reely don’t noe, Sally,” he sez, kiend of
      apolojiezing, “or u noe I wuud tel. I was a-studying oever
      mi text in Acts Seventeen befor brekfast, and I rekon I puut it in
      thair, not noetising, meening to puut mi Testament in, and it must be so,
      becauz mi Testament ain’t in; but I’ll go and see; and if th
      Testament is whair I had it, I’ll noe I didn’t puut it in, and
      that wil sho that I laed th Testament doun and tuuk up th spoon, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, for th land’s saek! Giv a body a rest! Go
      ’long now, th hoel kit and biling of ye; and don’t cum ni
      me agen til I’ve got bak mi pees of miend.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I’D a herd her if she’d a sed it to herself, let aloen
      speeking it out; and I’d a got up and oebayd her if I’d a bin
      ded. As we was pasing thru th seting-room th oeld man he tuuk
      up his hat, and th shinggl-nael fel out on th flor, and he just meerly
      pikt it up and laed it on th mantel-shelf, and never sed nuthing, and
      went out. Tom see him do it, and rememberd about th spoon, and
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, it ain’t no ues to send things bi <i>him</i> no mor,
      he ain’t relieabl.” Then he sez: “But he dun us a guud
      tern with th spoon, enyway, without noeing it, and so we’ll go and
      do him wun without <i>him</i> noeing it—stop up his rat-hoels.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thair was a noebl guud lot of them doun selar, and it tuuk us a hoel
      our, but we dun th job tiet and guud and shipshaep. Then we
      herd steps on th stairs, and blowed out our liet and hid; and heer
      cums th oeld man, with a candl in wun hand and a bundl of stuf in t’uther,
      luuking as absent-miended as yeer befor last. He went a mooning
      around, ferst to wun rat-hoel and then anuther, til he’d bin to
      them all. Then he stuud about fiev minits, piking talo-drip off
      of his candl and thinking. Then he terns off slo and dreemy
      tords th stairs, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, for th lief of me I can’t remember when I dun it.
      I cuud sho her now that I worn’t to blaem on acount of th
      rats. But never miend—let it go. I rekon it wouldn’t
      do no guud.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left. He was a
      miety nies oeld man. And allways is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was a guud deel botherd about whut to do for a spoon, but he sed we’d
      got to hav it; so he tuuk a think. When he had ciphered it out he
      toeld me how we was to do; then we went and waeted around th spoon-basket
      til we see Ant Sally cuming, and then Tom went to counting th spoons
      and laying them out to wun sied, and I slid wun of them up mi sleev, and
      Tom sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Ant Sally, thair ain’t but nien spoons <i>yet</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go ’long to yur play, and don’t bother me. I
      noe beter, I counted ’m mieself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I’ve counted them twies, Aunty, and I can’t maek
      but nien.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She luukt out of all paeshens, but of cors she cum to count—enybody
      wuud.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I declair to graeshus ther’ <i>ain’t</i> but nien!”
      she sez. “Whi, whut in th werld—plaeg <i>taek</i> th
      things, I’ll count ’m agen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So I slipt bak th wun I had, and when she got dun counting, she sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hang th trublsum rubbage, ther’s <i>ten</i> now!”
      and she luukt hufy and botherd boeth. But Tom sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Aunty, I don’t think thair’s ten.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U numskul, didn’t u see me <i>count ’m?</i>”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I noe, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I’ll count ’m <i>agen</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c37-321" id="c37-321"></a><br> <br>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      So I smouched wun, and thay cum out nien, saem as th uther tiem. Wel,
      she <i>was</i> in a tairing way—just a-trembling all oever, she was
      so mad. But she counted and counted til she got that addled she’d
      start to count in th basket for a spoon sumtiems; and so, three tiems
      thay cum out riet, and three tiems thay cum out rong. Then she
      grabd up th basket and slamd it across th hous and nokt th cat
      galy-west; and she sed cle’r out and let her hav sum pees, and
      if we cum bothering around her agen betwixt that and diner she’d
      skin us. So we had th od spoon, and dropt it in her aepron-poket
      whilst she was a-giving us our saeling orders, and Jim got it all riet,
      along with her shinggl nael, befor noon. We was verry wel satisfied
      with this biznes, and Tom alowd it was werth twies th trubl it
      tuuk, becauz he sed <i>now</i> she couldn’t ever count them spoons
      twies aliek agen to saev her lief; and wouldn’t beleev she’d
      counted them riet if she <i>did</i>; and sed that after she’d
      about counted her hed off for th next three days he jujd she’d
      giv it up and offer to kil enybody that wonted her to ever count them
      eny mor.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we puut th sheet bak on th lien that niet, and stoel wun out of her
      clozet; and kept on puuting it bak and steeling it agen for a cupl of
      days til she didn’t noe how meny sheets she had eny mor, and she
      didn’t <i>cair</i>, and worn’t a-going to buulyrag th rest of
      her soel out about it, and wouldn’t count them agen not to saev her
      lief; she druther die ferst.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we was all riet now, as to th shert and th sheet and th spoon and
      th candls, bi th help of th caf and th rats and th mixt-up
      counting; and as to th candlstik, it worn’t no conseqens, it
      wuud blo oever bi and bi.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that pi was a job; we had no end of trubl with that pi. We
      fixt it up away doun in th wuuds, and cuukt it thair; and we got it
      dun at last, and verry satisfactory, too; but not all in wun day; and we
      had to ues up three wosh-pans fuul of flour befor we got thru, and we
      got bernt prity much all oever, in plaeses, and ies puut out with th
      smoek; becauz, u see, we didn’t wont nuthing but a crust, and we
      couldn’t prop it up riet, and she wuud allways caev in. But
      of cors we thaut of th riet way at last—which was to cuuk th
      lader, too, in th pi. So then we laed in with Jim th second
      niet, and tore up th sheet all in litl strings and twisted them
      together, and long befor dayliet we had a luvly roep that u cuud a
      hung a person with. We let on it tuuk nien munths to maek it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in th fornoon we tuuk it doun to th wuuds, but it wouldn’t go
      into th pi. Being maed of a hoel sheet, that way, thair was roep
      enuf for forty pies if we’d a wonted them, and plenty left oever
      for soop, or sausej, or enything u chooz. We cuud a had a hoel
      diner.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      But we didn’t need it. All we needed was just enuf for th
      pi, and so we throwed th rest away. We didn’t cuuk nun of
      th pies in th wosh-pan—afraed th soder wuud melt; but Unkl
      Silas he had a noebl bras worming-pan which he thaut considerabl of,
      becauz it belongd to wun of his ancesters with a long wuuden handl that
      cum oever frum England with William th Conkeror in th Mayflower or wun
      of them erly ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of uther oeld
      pots and things that was valueabl, not on acount of being eny acount,
      becauz thay worn’t, but on acount of them being relicts, u noe,
      and we snaekt her out, prievet, and tuuk her doun thair, but she faeld on
      th ferst pies, becauz we didn’t noe how, but she cum up smieling
      on th last wun. We tuuk and liend her with doe, and set her in
      th coels, and loeded her up with rag roep, and puut on a doe roof, and
      shut doun th lid, and puut hot embers on top, and stuud off fiev fuut,
      with th long handl, cool and cumfortabl, and in fifteen minits she
      ternd out a pi that was a satisfacshun to luuk at. But th person that
      et it wuud wont to fech a cupl of kags of toothpiks along, for if
      that roep lader wouldn’t cramp him doun to biznes I don’t
      noe nuthing whut I’m tauking about, and lay him in enuf
      stumac-aek to last him til next tiem, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nat didn’t luuk when we puut th wich pi in Jim’s pan; and we
      puut th three tin plates in th botom of th pan under th vittles; and
      so Jim got evrything all riet, and as soon as he was bi himself he
      busted into th pi and hid th roep lader insied of his straw tik, and
      scracht sum marks on a tin plaet and throwed it out of th windo-hoel.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXVIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maeking them pens was a distressid tuf job, and so was th saw; and Jim
      alowd th inscripshun was going to be th tufest of all. That’s
      th wun which th prizoner has to scrabble on th wall. But he had
      to hav it; Tom sed he’d <i>got</i> to; thair worn’t no caes
      of a staet prizoner not scrabbling his inscripshun to leev behiend, and
      his coet of arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Luuk at Laedy Jane Gray,” he sez; “luuk at Gilford
      Dudley; luuk at oeld Northumberland! Whi, Huck, s’poez it <i>is</i>
      considerble trubl?—whut u going to do?—how u going to
      get around it? Jim’s <i>got</i> to do his inscripshun and coet
      of arms. Thay all do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Mars Tom, I hain’t got no coet o’ arm; I hain’t
      got nuffn but dish yer oelay shert, en u noes I got to keep de jernal on
      dat.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, u don’t understand, Jim; a coet of arms is verry
      diferent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel,” I sez, “Jim’s riet, enyway, when he sez
      he ain’t got no coet of arms, becauz he hain’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I rekon I knowed that,” Tom sez, “but u bet he’ll
      hav wun befor he goes out of this—becauz he’s going out <i>riet</i>,
      and thair ain’t going to be no flaws in his record.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So whilst me and Jim field away at th pens on a brikbat apees, Jim
      a-maeking his’n out of th bras and I maeking mien out of th spoon,
      Tom set to werk to think out th coet of arms. Bi and bi he sed he’d
      struk so meny guud wuns he didn’t hardly noe which to taek, but
      thair was wun which he rekond he’d desied on. He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “On th scutcheon we’ll hav a bend <i>or</i> in th dexter
      baes, a saltire <i>murrey</i> in th fes, with a daug, couchant, for
      comon charj, and under his fuut a chaen embatld, for slaevery, with a
      shevron <i>vert</i> in a cheef engrailed, and three invected liens on a
      feeld <i>azher</i>, with th nombril points rampant on a dancette
      indented; crest, a runaway nigger, <i>saebl</i>, with his bundl oever his
      shoelder on a bar sinister; and a cupl of gules for suporters, which is
      u and me; moto, <i>Maggiore Fretta, Minore Otto.</i> Got it out
      of a buuk—meens th mor haest th les speed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Geewhillikins,” I sez, “but whut duz th rest of it
      meen?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We ain’t got no tiem to bother oever that,” he sez;
      “we got to dig in liek all git-out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, enyway,” I sez, “whut’s <i>sum</i> of it?
      Whut’s a fes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A fes—a fes is—<i>u</i> don’t need to noe
      whut a fes is. I’ll sho him how to maek it when he gets to
      it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shuks, Tom,” I sez, “I think u miet tel a person.
      Whut’s a bar sinister?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, I don’t noe. But he’s got to hav it. All
      th noebility duz.”
    </p>
    <p>
      That was just his way. If it didn’t soot him to explaen a
      thing to u, he wouldn’t do it. U miet pump at him a week,
      it wouldn’t maek no diferens.
    </p>
    <p>
      He’d got all that coet of arms biznes fixt, so now he started in
      to finish up th rest of that part of th werk, which was to plan out a
      mornful inscripshun—sed Jim got to hav wun, liek thay all dun.
      He maed up a lot, and roet them out on a paeper, and red them off,
      so:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Heer a captiv hart busted. 2. Heer a pur prizoner,
      forsuuk bi th werld and frends, freted his sorroeful lief. 3. Heer
      a loenly hart broek, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after
      therty-seven yeers of solitairy captivity. 4. Heer, hoemles and
      frendles, after therty-seven yeers of biter captivity, perrisht a noebl
      straenjer, nacheral sun of Louis XIV.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom’s vois trembld whilst he was reeding them, and he moest broek
      doun. When he got dun he couldn’t no way maek up his miend which wun
      for Jim to scrabble on to th wall, thay was all so guud; but at last he
      alowd he wuud let him scrabble them all on. Jim sed it wuud
      taek him a yeer to scrabble such a lot of truk on to th logs with a
      nael, and he didn’t noe how to maek leters, besieds; but Tom sed
      he wuud blok them out for him, and then he wouldn’t hav nuthing
      to do but just folo th liens. Then prity soon he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cum to think, th logs ain’t a-going to do; thay don’t
      hav log walls in a dunjon: we got to dig th inscripshuns into a
      rok. We’ll fech a rok.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim sed th rok was wers than th logs; he sed it wuud taek him such
      a pison long tiem to dig them into a rok he wouldn’t ever get out.
      But Tom sed he wuud let me help him do it. Then he tuuk a
      luuk to see how me and Jim was geting along with th pens. It was
      moest pesky teedius hard werk and slo, and didn’t giv mi hands no
      sho to get wel of th sors, and we didn’t seem to maek no
      hedway, hardly; so Tom sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I noe how to fix it. We got to hav a rok for th coet of
      arms and mornful inscripshuns, and we can kil too berds with that saem
      rok. Thair’s a gaudy big griendstoen doun at th mil, and we’ll
      smouch it, and carv th things on it, and fiel out th pens and th saw
      on it, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c38-327" id="c38-327"></a><br> <br>

    </p>
    <p>
      It worn’t no slouch of an iedeea; and it worn’t no slouch of a
      griendstoen nuther; but we alowd we’d takl it. It worn’t
      qiet midniet yet, so we cleerd out for th mil, leeving Jim at werk.
      We smouched th griendstoen, and set out to roel her hoem, but it was
      a moest naeshun tuf job. Sumtiems, do whut we cuud, we couldn’t
      keep her frum falling oever, and she cum miety neer mashing us evry
      tiem. Tom sed she was going to get wun of us, shur, befor we got
      thru. We got her haf way; and then we was plum playd out, and
      moest drownded with swet. We see it worn’t no ues; we got to
      go and fech Jim. So he raezd up his bed and slid th chaen off of th
      bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round his nek, and we cralld out thru
      our hoel and doun thair, and Jim and me laed into that griendstoen and
      waukt her along liek nuthing; and Tom superintended. He cuud
      out-sooperintend eny boy I ever see. He knowed how to do evrything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our hoel was prity big, but it worn’t big enuf to get th
      griendstoen thru; but Jim he tuuk th pik and soon maed it big enuf.
      Then Tom markt out them things on it with th nael, and set Jim to
      werk on them, with th nael for a chizel and an ieern boelt frum th rubbage
      in th leen-to for a hamer, and toeld him to werk til th rest of his
      candl qit on him, and then he cuud go to bed, and hied th griendstoen
      under his straw tik and sleep on it. Then we helpt him fix his
      chaen bak on th bed-leg, and was redy for bed ourselvs. But Tom
      thaut of sumthing, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “U got eny spieders in heer, Jim?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sah, thanks to guudnes I hain’t, Mars Tom.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet, we’ll get u sum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But bles u, huny, I doan’ <i>wont</i> nun. I’s
      afeard un um. I jis’ ’s soon hav ratlsnaeks aroun’.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom thaut a minit or too, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a guud iedeea. And I rekon it’s bin dun.
      It <i>must</i> a bin dun; it stands to reezon. Yes, it’s
      a priem guud iedeea. Whair cuud u keep it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Keep whut, Mars Tom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, a ratlsnaek.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “De guudnes graeshus aliev, Mars Tom! Whi, if day was a
      ratlsnaek to cum in heah I’d taek en bust riet out thoo dat log
      wall, I wuud, wid mi hed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Jim, u wouldn’t be afraed of it after a litl. U
      cuud taem it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Taem</i> it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes—eezy enuf. Evry animal is graetful for kiendnes
      and peting, and thay wouldn’t <i>think</i> of herting a person that
      pets them. Eny buuk wil tel u that. U tri—that’s
      all I ask; just tri for too or three days. Whi, u can get him so, in a
      litl whiel, that he’ll luv u; and sleep with u; and wun’t
      stay away frum u a minit; and wil let u rap him round yur nek and
      puut his hed in yur mouth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Pleez</i>, Mars Tom—<i>doan</i>’ tauk so! I
      can’t <i>stan</i>’ it! He’d <i>let</i> me shuv
      his hed in mi mouf—fer a faevor, hain’t it? I lay he’d
      waet a pow’ful long tiem ’fo’ I <i>ast</i> him. En
      mo’ en dat, I doan’ <i>wont</i> him to sleep wid me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Jim, don’t act so foolish. A prizoner’s <i>got</i>
      to hav sum kiend of a dum pet, and if a ratlsnaek hain’t ever
      bin tried, whi, thair’s mor glory to be gaend in yur being th
      ferst to ever tri it than eny uther way u cuud ever think of to saev
      yur lief.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Mars Tom, I doan’ <i>wont</i> no sich glory. Snaek
      taek ’n biet Jim’s chin off, den <i>whah</i> is de glory?
      No, sah, I doan’ wont no sich doin’s.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Blaem it, can’t u <i>tri</i>? I oenly <i>wont</i> u
      to tri—u needn’t keep it up if it don’t werk.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But de trubl all <i>dun</i> ef de snaek biet me whiel I’s
      a tryin’ him. Mars Tom, I’s willin’ to takl mos’ 
      enything ’at ain’t onreasonable, but ef u en Huck fetches a

    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, let it go, let it go, if u’re so buul-heded
      about it. We can get u sum garter-snaeks, and u can tee sum

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, we’ll get u sum rats.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Mars Tom, I doan’ <i>wont</i> no rats. Day’s

      um, skasely.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, Jim, u <i>got</i> to hav ’em—thay all do.
      So don’t maek no mor fus about it. Prizoners ain’t
      ever without rats. Thair ain’t no instans of it. And
      thay traen them, and pet them, and lern them triks, and thay get to be
      as soeshabl as flies. But u got to play muezic to them. U
      got enything to play muezic on?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I ain’ got nuffn but a coase coem en a pees o’ paeper,
      en a joos-harp; but I reck’n day wouldn’ taek no stok in a
      joos-harp.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes thay wuud <i>thay</i> don’t cair whut kiend of muezic
      ’tis. A jews-harp’s plenty guud enuf for a rat. All
      animals liek muezic—in a prizon thay dote on it. Speshaly,
      paenful muezic; and u can’t get no uther kiend out of a jews-harp.
      It allways interests them; thay cum out to see whut’s th
      mater with u. Yes, u’re all riet; u’re fixt
      verry wel. U wont to set on yur bed niets befor u go to
      sleep, and erly in th mornings, and play yur jews-harp; play ‘Th
      Last Link is Broeken’—that’s th thing that ’ll
      scoop a rat qiker ’n enything els; and when u’ve playd
      about too minits u’ll see all th rats, and th snaeks, and
      spieders, and things begin to feel weryd about u, and cum. And
      thay’ll just fairly sworm oever u, and hav a noebl guud tiem.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, <i>day</i> wil, I reck’n, Mars Tom, but whut kine er
      tiem is <i>Jim</i> havin’? Blest if I kin see de pient. But I’ll
      do it ef I got to. I reck’n I beter keep de animals
      satisfied, en not hav no trubl in de hous.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom waeted to think it oever, and see if thair wasn’t nuthing els;
      and prity soon he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, thair’s wun thing I forgot. Cuud u raez a

    </p>

      “I doan noe but maybe I cuud, Mars Tom; but it’s tolable

      she’d be a pow’ful siet o’ trubl.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, u tri it, enyway. Sum uther prizoners has dun it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wun er dem big cat-tael-lookin’ mullen-stauks wuud gro in

    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t u beleev it. We’ll fech u a litl

      call it mullen, call it Pitchiola—that’s its riet naem when
      it’s in a prizon. And u wont to wauter it with yur teers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, I got plenty spring wauter, Mars Tom.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U don’t <i>wont</i> spring wauter; u wont to wauter it with
      yur teers. It’s th way thay allways do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raez wun er dem mullen-stauks twyste

      So Tom was stumpt. But he studyd it oever, and then sed Jim wuud
      hav to wery along th best he cuud with an unyon. He promist he
      wuud go to th nigger cabins and drop wun, prievet, in Jim’s
      coffy-pot, in th morning. Jim sed he wuud “jis’ ’s
      soon hav tobacker in his coffy;” and found so much fallt with it,
      and with th werk and bother of raezing th mullen, and jews-harping th
      rats, and peting and flatering up th snaeks and spieders and things, on
      top of all th uther werk he had to do on pens, and inscripshuns, and
      jernals, and things, which maed it mor trubl and wery and
      responsibility to be a prizoner than enything he ever undertuuk, that Tom
      moest lost all paeshens with him; and sed he was just loadened doun with
      mor gaudier chanses than a prizoner ever had in th werld to maek a naem
      for himself, and yet he didn’t noe enuf to apreeshiaet them, and
      thay was just about waested on him. So Jim he was sorry, and sed he

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXIX.
    </p>
    <p>
      In th morning we went up to th vilej and baut a wier rat-trap and
      fetched it doun, and unstopped th best rat-hoel, and in about an our we
      had fifteen of th bulliest kiend of wuns; and then we tuuk it and puut it
      in a saef plaes under Ant Sally’s bed. But whiel we was gon
      for spieders litl Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps
      found it thair, and oepend th dor of it to see if th rats wuud cum
      out, and thay did; and Ant Sally she cum in, and when we got bak she
      was a-standing on top of th bed raezing Cain, and th rats was doing whut
      thay cuud to keep off th dul tiems for her. So she tuuk and
      dusted us boeth with th hickry, and we was as much as too ours caching
      anuther fifteen or sixteen, drat that medlsum cub, and thay worn’t
      th likeliest, nuther, becauz th ferst hall was th pik of th flok.
      I never see a likelier lot of rats than whut that ferst hall was.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got a splendid stok of sorted spieders, and bugs, and frogs, and
      caterpilars, and wun thing or anuther; and we liek to got a hornet’s
      nest, but we didn’t. Th family was at hoem. We didn’t
      giv it riet up, but stayd with them as long as we cuud; becauz we
      alowd we’d tier them out or thay’d got to tier us out, and
      thay dun it. Then we got allycumpain and rubd on th plaeses, and
      was prity neer all riet agen, but couldn’t set doun conveenyunt.
      And so we went for th snaeks, and grabd a cupl of duzen garters
      and hous-snaeks, and puut them in a bag, and puut it in our room, and bi
      that tiem it was super-tiem, and a ratling guud onest day’s werk:
      and hunggry?—o, no, I rekon not! And thair worn’t
      a blest snaek up thair when we went bak—we didn’t haf tee
      th sak, and thay werkt out sumhow, and left. But it didn’t
      mater much, becauz thay was stil on th premises somewheres. So
      we jujd we cuud get sum of them agen. No, thair worn’t no
      reeal scairsity of snaeks about th hous for a considerabl spel. U’d
      see them driping frum th rafters and plaeses evry now and then; and thay
      generly landed in yur plaet, or doun th bak of yur nek, and moest of
      th tiem whair u didn’t wont them. Wel, thay was hansum
      and striept, and thair worn’t no harm in a milyon of them; but that
      never maed no diferens to Ant Sally; she despiezd snaeks, be th breed
      whut thay miet, and she couldn’t stand them no way u cuud fix
      it; and evry tiem wun of them flopt doun on her, it didn’t maek
      no diferens whut she was doing, she wuud just lay that werk doun and
      liet out. I never see such a wuuman. And u cuud heer her
      hoop to Jericho. U couldn’t get her to taek a-holt of wun
      of them with th tongs. And if she ternd oever and found wun in bed
      she wuud scrambl out and lift a houl that u wuud think th hous was
      afier. She disterbd th oeld man so that he sed he cuud moest wish
      thair hadn’t ever bin no snaeks creaeted. Whi, after evry
      last snaek had bin gon cleer out of th hous for as much as a week Ant
      Sally worn’t oever it yet; she worn’t neer oever it; when she
      was seting thinking about sumthing u cuud tuch her on th bak of
      her nek with a fether and she wuud jump riet out of her stokings.
      It was verry cuerius. But Tom sed all wimen was just so.
      He sed thay was maed that way for sum reezon or uther.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got a liking evry tiem wun of our snaeks cum in her way, and she
      alowd thees lickings worn’t nuthing to whut she wuud do if we
      ever loeded up th plaes agen with them. I didn’t miend th
      lickings, becauz thay didn’t amount to nuthing; but I miended th
      trubl we had to lay in anuther lot. But we got them laed in, and
      all th uther things; and u never see a cabin as bliethsum as Jim’s
      was when thay’d all sworm out for muezic and go for him. Jim
      didn’t liek th spieders, and th spieders didn’t liek Jim; and
      so thay’d lay for him, and maek it miety worm for him. And he
      sed that between th rats and th snaeks and th griendstoen thair worn’t
      no room in bed for him, skasely; and when thair was, a body couldn’t
      sleep, it was so lievly, and it was allways lievly, he sed, becauz <i>thay</i>
      never all slept at wun tiem, but tuuk tern about, so when th snaeks was
      asleep th rats was on dek, and when th rats ternd in th snaeks cum
      on woch, so he allways had wun gang under him, in his way, and t’uther
      gang having a sercus oever him, and if he got up to hunt a nue plaes th
      spieders wuud taek a chans at him as he crosst oever. He sed if he ever
      got out this tiem he wouldn’t ever be a prizoner agen, not for a
      salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, bi th end of three weeks evrything was in prity guud shaep.
      Th shert was sent in erly, in a pi, and evry tiem a rat bit Jim
      he wuud get up and riet a litl in his jernal whilst th ink was
      fresh; th pens was maed, th inscripshuns and so on was all carvd on th
      griendstoen; th bed-leg was sawd in too, and we had et up th sawdust,
      and it giv us a moest amaezing stumac-aek. We rekond we was all
      going to die, but didn’t. It was th moest undigestible sawdust
      I ever see; and Tom sed th saem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c39-335" id="c39-335"></a><br> <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      But as I was saying, we’d got all th werk dun now, at last; and we
      was all prity much fagd out, too, but maenly Jim. Th oeld man had
      roet a cupl of tiems to th plantaeshun belo Orleans to cum and get
      thair runaway nigger, but hadn’t got no anser, becauz thair worn’t
      no such plantaeshun; so he alowd he wuud advertiez Jim in th St. Louis
      and Nue Orleans paepers; and when he menshund th St. Louis wuns it giv
      me th coeld shivers, and I see we hadn’t no tiem to looz. So Tom
      sed, now for th nonnamous leters.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut’s them?” I sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wornings to th peepl that sumthing is up. Sumtiems it’s
      dun wun way, sumtiems anuther. But thair’s allways sumbody
      spieing around that givs noetis to th guvernor of th casl. When
      Louis XVI. was going to liet out of th Tooleries, a servant-gerl dun
      it. It’s a verry guud way, and so is th nonnamous leters.
      We’ll ues them boeth. And it’s uezhual for th
      prizoner’s muther to chaenj cloeths with him, and she stays in, and
      he slieds out in her cloeths. We’ll do that, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But luuky heer, Tom, whut do we wont to <i>worn</i> enybody for
      that sumthing’s up? Let them fiend it out for themselvs—it’s
      thair luukout.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I noe; but u can’t depend on them. It’s
      th way thay’ve acted frum th verry start—left us to do <i>evrything</i>.
      Thay’re so confieding and mulet-heded thay don’t taek
      noetis of nuthing at all. So if we don’t <i>giv</i> them
      noetis thair wun’t be noebody nor nuthing to interfeer with us, and
      so after all our hard werk and trubl this escaep ’ll go off
      perfectly flat; wun’t amount to nuthing—wun’t be nuthing
      <i>to</i> it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, as for me, Tom, that’s th way I’d liek.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shuks!” he sez, and luukt disgusted. So I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I ain’t going to maek no complaent. Eny way that
      soots u soots me. Whut u going to do about th servant-gerl?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U’ll be her. U slied in, in th midl of th
      niet, and huuk that yaller gerl’s frok.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Tom, that ’ll maek trubl next morning; becauz, of
      cors, she prob’bly hain’t got eny but that wun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I noe; but u don’t wont it but fifteen minits, to carry
      th nonnamous leter and shuv it under th frunt dor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet, then, I’ll do it; but I cuud carry it just as
      handy in mi oen togs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U wouldn’t luuk liek a servant-gerl <i>then</i>, wuud u?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, but thair wun’t be noebody to see whut I luuk liek, <i>enyway</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That ain’t got nuthing to do with it. Th thing for us
      to do is just to do our <i>duety</i>, and not wery about whether enybody
      <i>sees</i> us do it or not. Hain’t u got no prinsipl at all?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All riet, I ain’t saying nuthing; I’m th
      servant-gerl. Hoo’s Jim’s muther?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m his muther. I’ll huuk a goun frum Ant Sally.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, u’ll hav to stay in th cabin when me and Jim
      leevs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not much. I’ll stuf Jim’s cloeths fuul of straw
      and lay it on his bed to reprezent his muther in disgiez, and Jim ’ll
      taek th nigger wuuman’s goun off of me and wair it, and we’ll
      all evaed together. When a prizoner of stiel escaeps it’s
      calld an evaezhun. It’s allways calld so when a king escaeps,
      f’rinstance. And th saem with a king’s sun; it don’t
      maek no diferens whether he’s a nacheral wun or an unnacheral wun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So Tom he roet th nonnamous leter, and I smouched th yaller wench’s
      frok that niet, and puut it on, and shuvd it under th frunt dor, th
      way Tom toeld me to. It sed:
    </p>
    <p>
      Bewair. Trubl is brooing. Keep a sharp luukout. <i>Unnoen</i>
      <i>Frend</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Next niet we stuk a pikcher, which Tom drawed in blud, of a skul and
      crossbones on th frunt dor; and next niet anuther wun of a coffin on
      th bak dor. I never see a family in such a swet. Thay
      couldn’t a bin wers scaird if th plaes had a bin fuul of goests
      laying for them behiend evrything and under th beds and shivering thru
      th air. If a dor bangd, Ant Sally she jumpt and sed “ouch!”
      if enything fel, she jumpt and sed “ouch!” if u hapend
      to tuch her, when she worn’t noetising, she dun th saem; she
      couldn’t faes noeway and be satisfied, becauz she alowd thair was
      sumthing behiend her evry tiem—so she was allways a-wherling around
      suden, and saying “ouch,” and befor she’d got
      too-therds around she’d wherl bak agen, and say it agen; and she
      was afraed to go to bed, but she dasn’t set up. So th thing
      was werking verry wel, Tom sed; he sed he never see a thing werk mor
      satisfactory. He sed it shoed it was dun riet.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he sed, now for th grand bulj! So th verry next morning at th
      streek of daun we got anuther leter redy, and was wundering whut we
      beter do with it, becauz we herd them say at super thay was going to
      hav a nigger on woch at boeth dors all niet. Tom he went doun th
      lietning-rod to spi around; and th nigger at th bak dor was asleep,
      and he stuk it in th bak of his nek and cum bak. This leter
      sed:
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t betray me, I wish to be yur frend. Thair is a desprate
      gang of cutthroats frum oever in th Indian Territory going to steel yur
      runaway nigger to-niet, and thay hav bin trieing to scair u so as u
      wil stay in th hous and not bother them. I am wun of th gang,
      but hav got religgion and wish to qit it and leed an onest lief agen,
      and wil betray th helish dezien. Thay wil sneek doun frum northards,
      along th fens, at midniet exact, with a falls kee, and go in th nigger’s
      cabin to get him. I am to be off a pees and blo a tin horn if I see eny
      daenjer; but sted of that I wil <i>baa</i> liek a sheep soon as thay get
      in and not blo at all; then whilst thay ar geting his chaens loos, u
      slip thair and lok them in, and can kil them at yur leezher. Don’t
      do enything but just th way I am teling u, if u do thay wil
      suspishun sumthing and raez hoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish eny reword
      but to noe I hav dun th riet thing. <i>Unnoen Frend.</i>

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XL.
    </p>
    <p>
      We was feeling prity guud after brekfast, and tuuk mi canoo and went
      oever th river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a guud tiem, and tuuk a
      luuk at th raft and found her all riet, and got hoem laet to super, and
      found them in such a swet and wery thay didn’t noe which end thay
      was standing on, and maed us go riet off to bed th minit we was dun
      super, and wouldn’t tel us whut th trubl was, and never let on
      a werd about th nue leter, but didn’t need to, becauz we knowed
      as much about it as enybody did, and as soon as we was haf up stairs and
      her bak was ternd we slid for th selar cubord and loeded up a guud
      lunch and tuuk it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about
      haf-past eleven, and Tom puut on Ant Sally’s dres that he stoel
      and was going to start with th lunch, but sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whair’s th buter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I laed out a hunk of it,” I sez, “on a pees of a
      corn-pone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, u <i>left</i> it laed out, then—it ain’t heer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We can get along without it,” I sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We can get along <i>with</i> it, too,” he sez; “just
      u slied doun selar and fech it. And then moezy riet doun th
      lietning-rod and cum along. I’ll go and stuf th straw into Jim’s
      cloeths to reprezent his muther in disgiez, and be redy to <i>baa</i>
      liek a sheep and shuv soon as u get thair.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So out he went, and doun selar went I. Th hunk of buter, big as a
      person’s fist, was whair I had left it, so I tuuk up th slab of
      corn-pone with it on, and blowed out mi liet, and started up stairs verry
      stelthy, and got up to th maen flor all riet, but heer cums Ant
      Sally with a candl, and I clapt th truk in mi hat, and clapt mi hat
      on mi hed, and th next second she see me; and she sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “U bin doun selar?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes’m.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut u bin doing doun thair?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Noth’n.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Noth’n!</i>”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No’m.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, whut pozest u to go doun thair this tiem of niet?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t noe ’m.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U don’t <i>noe</i>? Don’t anser me that way.
      Tom, I wont to noe whut u bin <i>doing</i> doun thair.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hain’t bin doing a singgl thing, Ant Sally, I hoep to
      graeshus if I hav.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I rekond she’d let me go now, and as a generl thing she wuud; but
      I s’poez thair was so meny straenj things going on she was just in a
      swet about evry litl thing that worn’t yard-stik straet; so
      she sez, verry desieded:
    </p>
    <p>
      “U just march into that seting-room and stay thair til I cum.
      U bin up to sumthing u no biznes to, and I lay I’ll
      fiend out whut it is befor I’M dun with u.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So she went away as I oepend th dor and waukt into th seting-room.
      Mi, but thair was a croud thair! Fifteen farmers, and evry wun of
      them had a gun. I was moest powerful sik, and slunk to a chair and
      set doun. Thay was seting around, sum of them tauking a litl, in a lo
      vois, and all of them fijety and uneezy, but trieing to luuk liek thay
      worn’t; but I knowed thay was, becauz thay was allways taeking off
      thair hats, and puuting them on, and scraching thair heds, and chaenjing
      thair seets, and fumbling with thair butons. I worn’t eezy
      mieself, but I didn’t taek mi hat off, all th saem.
    </p>

    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I did wish Ant Sally wuud cum, and get dun with me, and lik me, if
      she wonted to, and let me get away and tel Tom how we’d oeverdun
      this thing, and whut a thundering hornet’s-nest we’d got
      ourselvs into, so we cuud stop fooling around straet off, and cleer
      out with Jim befor thees rips got out of paeshens and cum for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she cum and begun to ask me qeschuns, but I <i>couldn’t</i>
      anser them straet, I didn’t noe which end of me was up; becauz
      thees men was in such a fijet now that sum was wonting to start riet
      NOW and lay for them desperaadoes, and saying it worn’t but a fue
      minits to midniet; and uthers was trieing to get them to hoeld on and waet
      for th sheep-signal; and heer was Aunty peging away at th qeschuns,
      and me a-shaeking all oever and redy to sink doun in mi traks I was that
      scaird; and th plaes geting hoter and hoter, and th buter begining
      to melt and run doun mi nek and behiend mi eers; and prity soon, when wun
      of them sez, “I’M for going and geting in th cabin <i>ferst</i>
      and riet <i>now</i>, and caching them when thay cum,” I moest
      dropt; and a streek of buter cum a-trikling doun mi forhed, and
      Ant Sally she see it, and terns whiet as a sheet, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “For th land’s saek, whut <i>is</i> th mater with th
      chield? He’s got th braen-feever as shor as u’re born,
      and thay’re oozing out!”
    </p>
    <p>
      And evrybody runs to see, and she snaches off mi hat, and out cums th
      bred and whut was left of th buter, and she grabd me, and hugd me,
      and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, whut a tern u did giv me! and how glad and graetful I am it
      ain’t no wers; for luk’s agenst us, and it never raens but
      it pors, and when I see that truk I thaut we’d lost u, for I
      knowed bi th culor and all it was just liek yur braens wuud be if—Deer,
      deer, whyd’nt u <i>tel</i> me that was whut u’d bin doun
      thair for, I wouldn’t a caird. Now cler out to bed, and don’t
      lemme see no mor of u til morning!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was up stairs in a second, and doun th lietning-rod in anuther wun,
      and shinning thru th dark for th leen-to. I couldn’t
      hardly get mi werds out, I was so ankshus; but I toeld Tom as qik as I
      cuud we must jump for it now, and not a minit to looz—th hous
      fuul of men, yonder, with guns!
    </p>
    <p>
      His ies just blaezd; and he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No!—is that so? <i>ain’t</i> it buuly! Whi,
      Huck, if it was to do oever agen, I bet I cuud fech too hundred! If
      we cuud puut it off til—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hery! <i>Hery</i>!” I sez. “Whair’s
      Jim?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Riet at yur elbo; if u reech out yur arm u can tuch him.
      He’s drest, and evrything’s redy. Now we’ll
      slied out and giv th sheep-signal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But then we herd th tramp of men cuming to th dor, and herd them
      begin to fumbl with th pad-lok, and herd a man say:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I <i>toeld</i> u we’d be too soon; thay haeven’t cum—th
      dor is lokt. Heer, I’ll lok sum of u into th cabin, and u
      lay for ’em in th dark and kil ’em when thay cum; and th
      rest scater around a pees, and lisen if u can heer ’em cuming.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So in thay cum, but couldn’t see us in th dark, and moest trod on
      us whilst we was husling to get under th bed. But we got under all
      riet, and out thru th hoel, swift but sofft—Jim ferst, me next,
      and Tom last, which was acording to Tom’s orders. Now we was
      in th leen-to, and herd trampings cloez bi outsied. So we crept to
      th dor, and Tom stopt us thair and puut his ie to th crak, but
      couldn’t maek out nuthing, it was so dark; and whisperd and sed he
      wuud lisen for th steps to get ferther, and when he nujd us Jim must
      glied out ferst, and him last. So he set his eer to th crak and
      lisend, and lisend, and lisend, and th steps a-scraeping around out
      thair all th tiem; and at last he nujd us, and we slid out, and stoopt
      doun, not breething, and not maeking th leest noiz, and slipt stelthy
      tords th fens in Injun fiel, and got to it all riet, and me and Jim
      oever it; but Tom’s briches catched fast on a splinter on th top
      rael, and then he heer th steps cuming, so he had to puul loos, which
      snapt th splinter and maed a noiz; and as he dropt in our traks and
      started sumbody sings out:
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoo’s that? Anser, or I’ll shoot!”
    </p>
    <p>
      But we didn’t anser; we just unferld our heels and shuvd. Then
      thair was a rush, and a <i>Bang, Bang, Bang!</i> and th buulets fairly
      whizd around us! We herd them sing out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heer thay ar! Thay’ve broek for th river! After
      ’em, boys, and tern loos th daugs!”
    </p>
    <p>
      So heer thay cum, fuul tilt. We cuud heer them becauz thay wor
      boots and yeld, but we didn’t wair no boots and didn’t yel.
      We was in th path to th mil; and when thay got prity cloez on to
      us we dojd into th buush and let them go bi, and then dropt in behiend
      them. Thay’d had all th daugs shut up, so thay wouldn’t
      scair off th robers; but bi this tiem sumbody had let them loos, and
      heer thay cum, maeking powwow enuf for a milyon; but thay was our daugs;
      so we stopt in our traks til thay catched up; and when thay see it
      worn’t noebody but us, and no exsietment to offer them, thay oenly
      just sed houdy, and tore riet ahed tords th shouting and clatering;
      and then we up-steem agen, and whizd along after them til we was
      neerly to th mil, and then struk up thru th buush to whair mi canoo
      was tied, and hopt in and puuld for deer lief tords th midl of th
      river, but didn’t maek no mor noiz than we was obleeged to. Then
      we struk out, eezy and cumfortabl, for th ieland whair mi raft was; and
      we cuud heer them yeling and barking at eech uther all up and doun th
      bank, til we was so far away th sounds got dim and died out. And
      when we stept on to th raft I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Now</i>, oeld Jim, u’re a free man agen, and I bet u
      wun’t ever be a slaev no mor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “En a miety guud job it wuz, too, Huck. It ’uz pland
      buetiful, en it ’uz dun buetiful; en day ain’t <i>noebody</i>
      kin git up a plan dat’s mo’ mixt-up en splendid den whut dat
      wun wuz.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We was all glad as we cuud be, but Tom was th gladdest of all becauz he
      had a buulet in th caf of his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      When me and Jim herd that we didn’t feel so brash as whut we did
      befor. It was herting him considerabl, and bleeding; so we laed him in
      th wigwom and tore up wun of th duek’s sherts for to bandej him,
      but he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gimme th rags; I can do it mieself. Don’t stop now; don’t
      fool around heer, and th evaezhun booming along so hansum; man th
      sweeps, and set her loos! Boys, we dun it elegant!—’deed
      we did. I wish <i>we’d</i> a had th handling of Louis XVI.,
      thair wouldn’t a bin no ‘Sun of Saent Louis, asend to
      heven!’ roet doun in <i>his</i> bieografy; no, ser, we’d a
      whooped him oever th <i>border</i>—that’s whut we’d a
      dun with <i>him</i>—and dun it just as slik as nuthing at all,
      too. Man th sweeps—man th sweeps!”
    </p>
    <p>
      But me and Jim was consulting—and thinking. And after we’d
      thaut a minit, I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say it, Jim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, den, dis is de way it luuk to me, Huck. Ef it wuz <i>him</i>
      dat ’uz bein’ sot free, en wun er de boys wuz to git shot,
      wuud he say, ‘Go on en saev me, nemmine ’bout a doctor f’r
      to saev dis wun?’ Is dat liek Mars Tom Sawyer? Wuud he
      say dat? U <i>bet</i> he wouldn’t! <i>wel</i>, den,
      is <i>Jim</i> gywne to say it? No, sah—I doan’ buj a
      step out’n dis plaes ’dout a <i>doctor</i>, not if it’s

    </p>
    <p>
      I knowed he was whiet insied, and I rekond he’d say whut he did
      say—so it was all riet now, and I toeld Tom I was a-going for a
      doctor. He raezd considerabl ro about it, but me and Jim stuk to
      it and wouldn’t buj; so he was for cralling out and seting th
      raft loos himself; but we wouldn’t let him. Then he giv us a
      pees of his miend, but it didn’t do no guud.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when he sees me geting th canoo redy, he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, then, if u’re bound to go, I’ll tel u th
      way to do when u get to th vilej. Shut th dor and bliendfoeld
      th doctor tiet and fast, and maek him swair to be sielent as th graev,
      and puut a pers fuul of goeld in his hand, and then taek and leed him all
      around th bak alys and everywheres in th dark, and then fech him
      heer in th canoo, in a roundabout way amungst th ielands, and serch him
      and taek his chauk away frum him, and don’t giv it bak to him til
      u get him bak to th vilej, or els he wil chauk this raft so he can
      fiend it agen. It’s th way thay all do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So I sed I wuud, and left, and Jim was to hied in th wuuds when he see
      th doctor cuming til he was gon agen.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XLI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th doctor was an oeld man; a verry nies, kiend-luuking oeld man when I got
      him up. I toeld him me and mi bruther was oever on Spanish Ieland
      hunting yesterday afternoon, and campt on a pees of a raft we found, and
      about midniet he must a kikt his gun in his dreems, for it went off and
      shot him in th leg, and we wonted him to go oever thair and fix it and not
      say nuthing about it, nor let enybody noe, becauz we wonted to cum hoem
      this eevning and serpriez th foeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoo is yur foeks?” he sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th Phelpses, doun yonder.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O,” he sez. And after a minit, he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “How’d u say he got shot?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He had a dreem,” I sez, “and it shot him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Singguelar dreem,” he sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he lit up his lantern, and got his sadl-bags, and we started. But
      when he sees th canoo he didn’t liek th luuk of her—sed she
      was big enuf for wun, but didn’t luuk prity saef for too. I
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, u needn’t be afeard, ser, she carryd th three of us
      eezy enuf.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut three?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, me and Sid, and—and—and <i>th guns</i>; that’s
      whut I meen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O,” he sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he puut his fuut on th gunel and rokt her, and shuuk his hed, and
      sed he rekond he’d luuk around for a biger wun. But thay
      was all lokt and chained; so he tuuk mi canoo, and sed for me to waet
      til he cum bak, or I cuud hunt around ferther, or maybe I beter go
      doun hoem and get them redy for th serpriez if I wonted to. But I
      sed I didn’t; so I toeld him just how to fiend th raft, and then he
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      I struk an iedeea prity soon. I sez to mieself, spos’n he can’t
      fix that leg just in three shaeks of a sheep’s tael, as th saying
      is? spos’n it taeks him three or foer days? Whut ar we going
      to do?—lay around thair til he lets th cat out of th bag? No,
      ser; I noe whut <i>I’ll</i> do. I’ll waet, and when he
      cums bak if he sez he’s got to go eny mor I’ll get doun
      thair, too, if I swim; and we’ll taek and tee him, and keep him, and
      shuv out doun th river; and when Tom’s dun with him we’ll
      giv him whut it’s werth, or all we got, and then let him get
      ashor.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then I crept into a lumber-piel to get sum sleep; and next tiem I
      waekt up th sun was away up oever mi hed! I shot out and went for
      th doctor’s hous, but thay toeld me he’d gon away in th
      niet sum tiem or uther, and worn’t bak yet. Wel, thinks I,
      that luuks powerful bad for Tom, and I’ll dig out for th ieland
      riet off. So away I shuvd, and ternd th corner, and neerly
      ramd mi hed into Unkl Silas’s stumac! He sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, <i>Tom!</i> Whair u bin all this tiem, u rascal?”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <a name="c41-348" id="c41-348"></a><br> <br>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hain’t bin nowheres,” I sez, “oenly just
      hunting for th runaway nigger—me and Sid.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, whair ever did u go?” he sez. “Yur ant’s
      bin miety uneezy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “She needn’t,” I sez, “becauz we was all riet.
      We foloed th men and th daugs, but thay outrun us, and we lost
      them; but we thaut we herd them on th wauter, so we got a canoo and
      tuuk out after them and crosst oever, but couldn’t fiend nuthing of
      them; so we cruised along up-shor til we got kiend of tierd and beet out;
      and tied up th canoo and went to sleep, and never waekt up til about an
      our ago; then we paddled oever heer to heer th nues, and Sid’s at
      th poest-offis to see whut he can heer, and I’m a-branching out to
      get sumthing to eet for us, and then we’re going hoem.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So then we went to th poest-offis to get “Sid”; but just as I
      suspicioned, he worn’t thair; so th oeld man he got a leter out of
      th offis, and we waeted awhiel longger, but Sid didn’t cum; so th
      oeld man sed, cum along, let Sid fuut it hoem, or canoo it, when he got
      dun fooling around—but we wuud ried. I couldn’t get
      him to let me stay and waet for Sid; and he sed thair worn’t no ues
      in it, and I must cum along, and let Ant Sally see we was all riet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got hoem Ant Sally was that glad to see me she laft and cried
      boeth, and hugd me, and giv me wun of them lickings of hern that don’t
      amount to shuks, and sed she’d serv Sid th saem when he cum.
    </p>
    <p>
      And th plaes was plum fuul of farmers and farmers’ wievs, to
      diner; and such anuther clack a body never herd. Oeld Mrs.
      Hotchkiss was th werst; her tung was a-going all th tiem. She
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, Sister Phelps, I’ve ransakt that-air cabin oever, an’ 
      I b’lieve th nigger was craezy. I sez to Sister Damrell—didn’t

    <p>
      Sez I to mieself, I can explaen beter how we cum to not be in that room
      this morning if I go out to wun sied and study oever it a litl. So
      I dun it. But I dasn’t go fer, or she’d a sent for me.
      And when it was laet in th day th peepl all went, and then I cum
      in and toeld her th noiz and shooting waekt up me and “Sid,”
      and th dor was lokt, and we wonted to see th fun, so we went doun th
      lietning-rod, and boeth of us got hert a litl, and we didn’t never
      wont to tri <i>that</i> no mor. And then I went on and toeld her all
      whut I toeld Unkl Silas befor; and then she sed she’d forgiv us,
      and maybe it was all riet enuf enyway, and about whut a body miet
      expect of boys, for all boys was a prity harum-scarum lot as fer as she
      cuud see; and so, as long as no harm hadn’t cum of it, she jujd
      she beter puut in her tiem being graetful we was aliev and wel and she
      had us stil, sted of freting oever whut was past and dun. So then
      she kist me, and pated me on th hed, and dropt into a kiend of a
      broun study; and prity soon jumps up, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, lawsamercy, it’s moest niet, and Sid not cum yet!
      Whut <i>has</i> becum of that boy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I see mi chans; so I skips up and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll run riet up to toun and get him,” I sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No u wun’t,” she sez. “U’ll stay riet
      wher’ u ar; <i>wun’s</i> enuf to be lost at a tiem.
      If he ain’t heer to super, yur unkl ’ll go.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, he worn’t thair to super; so riet after super unkl went.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cum bak about ten a litl bit uneezy; hadn’t run across Tom’s
      trak. Ant Sally was a guud <i>deel</i> uneezy; but Unkl Silas he sed
      thair worn’t no ocaezhun to be—boys wil be boys, he sed, and
      u’ll see this wun tern up in th morning all sound and riet.
      So she had to be satisfied. But she sed she’d set up
      for him a whiel enyway, and keep a liet berning so he cuud see it.

      And then when I went up to bed she cum up with me and fetched her candl,
      and tukt me in, and mutherd me so guud I felt meen, and liek I couldn’t
      luuk her in th faes; and she set doun on th bed and taukt with me a
      long tiem, and sed whut a splendid boy Sid was, and didn’t seem to
      wont to ever stop tauking about him; and kept asking me evry now and then
      if I rekond he cuud a got lost, or hert, or maybe drownded, and miet
      be laying at this minit somewheres sufering or ded, and she not bi him
      to help him, and so th teers wuud drip doun sielent, and I wuud tel her
      that Sid was all riet, and wuud be hoem in th morning, shur; and she
      wuud sqeez mi hand, or maybe kis me, and tel me to say it agen, and
      keep on saying it, becauz it dun her guud, and she was in so much
      trubl. And when she was going away she luukt doun in mi ies so
      stedy and jentl, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th dor ain’t going to be lokt, Tom, and thair’s th

      And u wun’t go? For <i>mi</i> saek.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Laws noes I <i>wonted</i> to go bad enuf to see about Tom, and was all
      intending to go; but after that I wouldn’t a went, not for kingdoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was on mi miend and Tom was on mi miend, so I slept verry restles.
      And twies I went doun th rod away in th niet, and slipt around frunt,
      and see her seting thair bi her candl in th windo with her ies
      tords th roed and th teers in them; and I wisht I cuud do sumthing
      for her, but I couldn’t, oenly to swair that I wouldn’t never
      do nuthing to greev her eny mor. And th therd tiem I waekt up at
      daun, and slid doun, and she was thair yet, and her candl was moest out,
      and her oeld gray hed was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XLII.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th oeld man was uptoun agen befor brekfast, but couldn’t get no
      trak of Tom; and boeth of them set at th taebl thinking, and not saying
      nuthing, and luuking mornful, and thair coffy geting coeld, and not
      eeting enything. And bi and bi th oeld man sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did I giv u th leter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut leter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th wun I got yesterday out of th poest-offis.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, u didn’t giv me no leter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I must a forgot it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So he rumejd his pokets, and then went off somewheres whair he had laed
      it doun, and fetched it, and giv it to her. She sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, it’s frum St. Petersburg—it’s frum Sis.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I alowd anuther wauk wuud do me guud; but I couldn’t ster. But
      befor she cuud braek it oepen she dropt it and run—for she see
      sumthing. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a matres; and that oeld
      doctor; and Jim, in <i>her</i> calico dres, with his hands tied behiend
      him; and a lot of peepl. I hid th leter behiend th ferst thing
      that cum handy, and rusht. She flung herself at Tom, crieing, and
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, he’s ded, he’s ded, I noe he’s ded!”
    </p>
    <p>
      And Tom he ternd his hed a litl, and muterd sumthing or uther,
      which shoed he worn’t in his riet miend; then she flung up her
      hands, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “He’s aliev, thank God! And that’s enuf!”
      and she snacht a kis of him, and floo for th hous to get th bed
      redy, and scatering orders riet and left at th niggers and evrybody
      els, as fast as her tung cuud go, evry jump of th way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I foloed th men to see whut thay was going to do with Jim; and th oeld
      doctor and Unkl Silas foloed after Tom into th hous. Th men
      was verry hufy, and sum of them wonted to hang Jim for an exampl to all
      th uther niggers around thair, so thay wouldn’t be trieing to run
      away liek Jim dun, and maeking such a raft of trubl, and keeping a hoel
      family scaird moest to deth for days and niets. But th uthers
      sed, don’t do it, it wouldn’t anser at all; he ain’t
      our nigger, and his oener wuud tern up and maek us pay for him, shur.
      So that coold them doun a litl, becauz th peepl that’s
      allways th moest ankshus for to hang a nigger that hain’t dun just
      riet is allways th verry wuns that ain’t th moest ankshus to pay for
      him when thay’ve got thair satisfacshun out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thay cussed Jim considerble, tho, and giv him a cuf or too sied th
      hed wuns in a whiel, but Jim never sed nuthing, and he never let on to
      noe me, and thay tuuk him to th saem cabin, and puut his oen cloeths on
      him, and chained him agen, and not to no bed-leg this tiem, but to a big
      staepl droev into th botom log, and chained his hands, too, and boeth
      legs, and sed he worn’t to hav nuthing but bred and wauter to eet
      after this til his oener cum, or he was soeld at aucshun becauz he didn’t
      cum in a serten length of tiem, and fild up our hoel, and sed a
      cupl of farmers with guns must stand woch around about th cabin evry
      niet, and a buuldaug tied to th dor in th daytiem; and about this tiem
      thay was thru with th job and was taepering off with a kiend of generl
      guud-bi cussing, and then th oeld doctor cums and taeks a luuk, and
      sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t be no rufer on him than u’re obleeged to,
      becauz he ain’t a bad nigger. When I got to whair I found th
      boy I see I couldn’t cut th buulet out without sum help, and he
      worn’t in no condishun for me to leev to go and get help; and he
      got a litl wers and a litl wers, and after a long tiem he went out
      of his hed, and wouldn’t let me cum a-ni him eny mor, and sed
      if I chaukt his raft he’d kil me, and no end of wield foolishnes
      liek that, and I see I couldn’t do enything at all with him; so I
      sez, I got to hav <i>help</i> sumhow; and th minit I sez it out
      cralls this nigger frum somewheres and sez he’ll help, and he dun
      it, too, and dun it verry wel. Of cors I jujd he must be a
      runaway nigger, and thair I <i>was</i>! and thair I had to stik riet
      straet along all th rest of th day and all niet. It was a fix,
      I tel u! I had a cupl of paeshents with th chils, and of cors I’d
      of liekt to run up to toun and see them, but I dasn’t, becauz th
      nigger miet get away, and then I’d be to blaem; and yet never a
      skif cum cloez enuf for me to hael. So thair I had to stik
      plum until dayliet this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a
      beter nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,
      and was all tierd out, too, and I see plaen enuf he’d bin werkt
      maen hard laetly. I liekt th nigger for that; I tel u,
      jentlmen, a nigger liek that is werth a thouzand dolars—and kiend
      treetment, too. I had evrything I needed, and th boy was doing as
      wel thair as he wuud a dun at hoem—beter, maybe, becauz it was
      so qieet; but thair I <i>was</i>, with boeth of ’m on mi hands, and
      thair I had to stik til about daun this morning; then sum men in a
      skif cum bi, and as guud luk wuud hav it th nigger was seting bi
      th palet with his hed propt on his nees sound asleep; so I moeshund
      them in qieet, and thay slipt up on him and grabd him and tied him
      befor he knowed whut he was about, and we never had no trubl. And th
      boy being in a kiend of a fliety sleep, too, we mufld th ors and
      hicht th raft on, and toed her oever verry nies and qieet, and th
      nigger never maed th leest ro nor sed a werd frum th start. He
      ain’t no bad nigger, jentlmen; that’s whut I think about him.”

      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sumbody sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, it sounds verry guud, doctor, I’m obleeged to say.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then th uthers soffend up a litl, too, and I was miety thankful to
      that oeld doctor for doing Jim that guud tern; and I was glad it was
      acording to mi jujment of him, too; becauz I thaut he had a guud
      hart in him and was a guud man th ferst tiem I see him. Then thay
      all agreed that Jim had acted verry wel, and was dezerving to hav sum
      noetis tuuk of it, and reword. So evry wun of them promist, riet
      out and harty, that thay wouldn’t cuss him no mor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then thay cum out and lokt him up. I hoept thay was going to say
      he cuud hav wun or too of th chaens tuuk off, becauz thay was roten
      hevy, or cuud hav meet and greens with his bred and wauter; but thay
      didn’t think of it, and I rekond it worn’t best for me to
      mix in, but I jujd I’d get th doctor’s yarn to Ant Sally
      sumhow or uther as soon as I’d got thru th braekers that was
      laying just ahed of me—explanaeshuns, I meen, of how I forgot to
      menshun about Sid being shot when I was teling how him and me puut in that
      dratted niet padling around hunting th runaway nigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I had plenty tiem. Ant Sally she stuk to th sik-room all day
      and all niet, and evry tiem I see Unkl Silas mooning around I dojd
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I herd Tom was a guud deel beter, and thay sed Ant Sally
      was gon to get a nap. So I slips to th sik-room, and if I found
      him awaek I rekond we cuud puut up a yarn for th family that wuud
      wosh. But he was sleeping, and sleeping verry peesful, too; and pael, not
      fier-faest th way he was when he cum. So I set doun and laed for
      him to waek. In about haf an our Ant Sally cums gliding in, and
      thair I was, up a stump agen! She moeshund me to be stil, and set
      doun bi me, and begun to whisper, and sed we cuud all be joyful now,
      becauz all th simptoms was ferst-raet, and he’d bin sleeping liek
      that for ever so long, and luuking beter and peacefuller all th tiem,
      and ten to wun he’d waek up in his riet miend.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we set thair woching, and bi and bi he sters a bit, and oepend his
      ies verry nacheral, and taeks a luuk, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Helo!—whi, I’m at <i>hoem</i>! How’s that?
      Whair’s th raft?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s all riet,” I sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And <i>Jim</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Th saem,” I sez, but couldn’t say it prity brash.
      But he never noetist, but sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guud! Splendid! <i>Now</i> we’re all riet and
      saef! Did u tel Aunty?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was going to say yes; but she chipt in and sez: “About whut,
      Sid?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, about th way th hoel thing was dun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut hoel thing?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, <i>th</i> hoel thing. Thair ain’t but wun; how
      we set th runaway nigger free—me and Tom.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guud land! Set th run—Whut <i>is</i> th chield tauking
      about! Deer, deer, out of his hed agen!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>No</i>, I ain’t out of mi <i>hed</i>; I noe all whut I’m
      tauking about. We <i>did</i> set him free—me and Tom. We
      laed out to do it, and we <i>dun</i> it. And we dun it elegant,
      too.” He’d got a start, and she never chekt him up,
      just set and staird and staird, and let him clip along, and I see it worn’t
      no ues for <i>me</i> to puut in. “Whi, Aunty, it cost us a power of
      werk—weeks of it—ours and ours, evry niet, whilst u was
      all asleep. And we had to steel candls, and th sheet, and th shert, and
      yur dres, and spoons, and tin plates, and caes-nievs, and th
      worming-pan, and th griendstoen, and flour, and just no end of things, and

    </p>
    <p>
      “Mersy sakes!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “—and loed up th cabin with rats and snaeks and so on, for

      them go bi, and when th daugs cum thay worn’t interested in us, but
      went for th moest noiz, and we got our canoo, and maed for th raft, and
      was all saef, and Jim was a free man, and we dun it all bi ourselvs, and
      <i>wasn’t</i> it buuly, Aunty!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I never herd th lieks of it in all mi born days! So

      But Tom, he <i>was</i> so proud and joyful, he just <i>couldn’t</i>
      hoeld in, and his tung just <i>went</i> it—she a-chiping in, and
      spiting fier all along, and boeth of them going it at wuns, liek a cat

      “Medling with <i>hoo</i>?” Tom sez, droping his smiel

    <p>
      “With <i>hoo</i>? Whi, th runaway nigger, of cors. Hoo’d

    </p>

      Tom luuks at me verry graev, and sez:

      he got away?”
    </p>

      Tom roez sqair up in bed, with his ie hot, and his nostrils oepening and
      shuting liek gils, and sings out to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thay hain’t no <i>riet</i> to shut him up! Shuv!—and
      don’t u looz a minit. Tern him loos! he ain’t no
      slaev; he’s as free as eny cretur that wauks this erth!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whut <i>duz</i> th chield meen?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I meen evry werd I <i>say</i>, Ant Sally, and if sumbody don’t
      go, <i>I’ll</i> go. I’ve knowed him all his lief, and so has
      Tom, thair. Oeld Mis Watson died too munths ago, and she was ashaemd
      she ever was going to sel him doun th river, and <i>sed</i> so; and she
      set him free in her wil.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then whut on erth did <i>u</i> wont to set him free for, seeing
      he was allredy free?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, that <i>is</i> a qeschun, I must say; and just liek wimen!
      Whi, I wonted th <i>advencher</i> of it; and I’d a waeded
      nek-deep in blud to—guudnes aliev, <i>Ant Polly!</i>”
    </p>
    <p>
      If she worn’t standing riet thair, just insied th dor, luuking as
      sweet and contented as an aenjel haf fuul of pi, I wish I may never!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ant Sally jumpt for her, and moest hugd th hed off of her, and cried
      oever her, and I found a guud enuf plaes for me under th bed, for it was
      geting prity sultry for us, seemd to me. And I peeped out, and in
      a litl whiel Tom’s Ant Polly shuuk herself loos and stuud thair
      luuking across at Tom oever her spectacls—kiend of griending him into
      th erth, u noe. And then she sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, u <i>beter</i> tern y’r hed away—I wuud if I
      was u, Tom.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O, deary me!” sez Ant Sally; “<i>Is</i> he chaenjd
      so? Whi, that ain’t <i>Tom</i>, it’s Sid; Tom’s—Tom’s—whi,
      whair is Tom? He was heer a minit ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “U meen whair’s Huck <i>Finn</i>—that’s whut u
      meen! I rekon I hain’t raezd such a scamp as mi Tom all
      thees yeers not to noe him when I <i>see</i> him. That <i>wuud</i>
      be a prity houdy-do. Cum out frum under that bed, Huck Finn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So I dun it. But not feeling brash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ant Sally she was wun of th mixt-upest-luuking persons I ever see—exsept
      wun, and that was Unkl Silas, when he cum in and thay toeld it all to
      him. It kiend of maed him drunk, as u may say, and he didn’t
      noe nuthing at all th rest of th day, and preecht a prair-meeting
      sermon that niet that gaev him a ratling ruputation, becauz th oeldest
      man in th werld couldn’t a understuud it. So Tom’s Ant
      Polly, she toeld all about hoo I was, and whut; and I had to up and tel
      how I was in such a tiet plaes that when Mrs. Phelps tuuk me for Tom
      Sawyer—she chipt in and sez, “O, go on and call me Ant
      Sally, I’m uezd to it now, and ’tain’t no need to chaenj”—that
      when Ant Sally tuuk me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it—thair worn’t
      no uther way, and I knowed he wouldn’t miend, becauz it wuud be
      nuts for him, being a mistery, and he’d maek an advencher out of it,
      and be perfectly satisfied. And so it ternd out, and he let on to
      be Sid, and maed things as sofft as he cuud for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his Ant Polly she sed Tom was riet about oeld Mis Watson seting
      Jim free in her wil; and so, shur enuf, Tom Sawyer had gon and tuuk
      all that trubl and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn’t
      ever understand befor, until that minit and that tauk, how he <i>cuud</i>
      help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wel, Ant Polly she sed that when Ant Sally roet to her that Tom and
      <i>Sid</i> had cum all riet and saef, she sez to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Luuk at that, now! I miet hav expected it, leting him go
      off that way without enybody to woch him. So now I got to go and
      trapse all th way doun th river, eleven hundred miel, and fiend out whut
      that creetur’s up to <i>this</i> tiem, as long as I couldn’t
      seem to get eny anser out of u about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, I never herd nuthing frum u,” sez Ant Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I wunder! Whi, I roet u twies to ask u whut u
      cuud meen bi Sid being heer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel, I never got ’em, Sis.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ant Polly she terns around slo and seveer, and sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “U, Tom!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wel—<i>whut</i>?” he sez, kiend of pettish.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t u whut <i>me</i>, u impuedent thing—hand out
      them leters.”

      I wonted to offer to bet too dolars she hadn’t, but I rekond

      <br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER Th LAST
    </p>
    <p>
      Th ferst tiem I catched Tom prievet I askt him whut was his iedeea, tiem
      of th evaezhun?—whut it was he’d pland to do if th evaezhun
      werkt all riet and he manejd to set a nigger free that was allredy free
      befor? And he sed, whut he had pland in his hed frum th start, if we
      got Jim out all saef, was for us to run him doun th river on th raft,
      and hav advenchers plum to th mouth of th river, and then tel him
      about his being free, and taek him bak up hoem on a steemboet, in stiel,
      and pay him for his lost tiem, and riet werd ahed and get out all th
      niggers around, and hav them wallts him into toun with a torchliet
      proseshun and a bras-band, and then he wuud be a heero, and so wuud we.
      But I rekond it was about as wel th way it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had Jim out of th chaens in no tiem, and when Ant Polly and Unkl
      Silas and Ant Sally found out how guud he helpt th doctor ners Tom,
      thay maed a heep of fus oever him, and fixt him up priem, and giv him
      all he wonted to eet, and a guud tiem, and nuthing to do. And we had
      him up to th sik-room, and had a hi tauk; and Tom giv Jim forty
      dolars for being prizoner for us so paeshent, and doing it up so guud, and
      Jim was pleezd moest to deth, and busted out, and sez:

    </div>
    <p>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dah, now, Huck, whut I tel u?—whut I tel u up dah on
      Jackson islan’? I <i>toel</i> u I got a hairy breas’,
      en whut’s de sien un it; en I <i>toel</i> u I ben rich wunst, en
      gwineter to be rich <i>agin</i>; en it’s cum troo; en heah she is!
      <i>dah</i>, now! doan’ tauk to <i>me</i>—siens is <i>siens</i>,
      mien I tel u; en I knowed jis’ ’s wel ’at I ’uz
      gwineter be rich agin as I’s a-stannin’ heah dis minit!”
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Tom he taukt along and taukt along, and sez, le’s all
      three slied out of heer wun of thees niets and get an outfit, and go for
      houling advenchers amungst th Injuns, oever in th Territory, for a cupl
      of weeks or too; and I sez, all riet, that soots me, but I ain’t
      got no muny for to bi th outfit, and I rekon I couldn’t get nun
      frum hoem, becauz it’s liekly pap’s bin bak befor now, and
      got it all away frum Juj Thatcher and drunk it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, he hain’t,” Tom sez; “it’s all thair
      yet—six thouzand dolars and mor; and yur pap hain’t ever
      bin bak sinss. Hadn’t when I cum away, enyhow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim sez, kiend of solem:
    </p>
    <p>
      “He ain’t a-comin’ bak no mo’, Huck.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whi, Jim?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nemmine whi, Huck—but he ain’t comin’ bak no mo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But I kept at him; so at last he sez:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doan’ u ’member de hous dat was floet’n doun
      de river, en day wuz a man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered
      him and didn’ let u cum in? Wel, den, u kin git yo’ 
      muny when u wonts it, kase dat wuz him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom’s moest wel now, and got his buulet around his nek on a
      woch-gard for a woch, and is allways seeing whut tiem it is, and so
      thair ain’t nuthing mor to riet about, and I am roten glad of it,
      becauz if I’d a knowed whut a trubl it was to maek a buuk I
      wouldn’t a takld it, and ain’t a-going to no mor. But
      I rekon I got to liet out for th Territory ahed of th rest, becauz
      Ant Sally she’s going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can’t
      stand it. I bin thair befor.
