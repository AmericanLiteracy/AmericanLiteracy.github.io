<p>
"<span class="smc">Christmas</span> wun't be Christmas without any 
prezents," grumbld Jo, lieing on th rug.</p>

<p>
"It's so dredful to be puur!" sighed Meg, luuking doun at her
oeld dres.</p>

<p>"I don't think it's faer for sum gurls to hav plenty of prity
things, and uther gurls nuthing at all," aded litl Amy, with an
injerd snif.</p>

<p>"We've got faather and muther and eech uther," sed Beth contentedly,
from her corner.</p>

<p>Th foer yung faeses on which th fierliet shone brietend at th
cheerful wurds, but darkend again as Jo sed sadly,—</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">2</span>
"We haeven't got faather, and shal not hav him for a long tiem."
She didn't sae "perhaps never," but eech silently aded it, thinking
of faather far away, whaer th fieting wuz.</p>

<p>Noebody spoek for a mienuet; then Meg sed in an aulterd toen,—</p>

<p>"U noe th reezon muther propoezd not having any prezents
this Christmas wuz because it is going to be a hard winter for every
wun; and she thinks we aut not to spend muny for plezher, when
our men ar sufering so in th army. We can't do much, but we can
maek our litl sacrifieses, and aut to do it gladly. But I am afraed
I don't;" and Meg shuuk her hed, as she thaut regretfully of all
th prity things she wontedw.</p>

<p>"But I don't think th litl we should spend wuud do any guud.
We've eech got a dolar, and th army wouldn't be much helpt by
our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from muther or U,
but I do wont to bie Undine and Sintram for mieself; I've wontedw it
<em>so</em> long," sed Jo, hoo wuz a bookworm.</p>

<p>"I pland to spend mien in nue muezik," sed Beth, with a litl
sie, which no wun hurd but th harth-brush and ketl-hoelder.</p>

<p>"I shal get a niess box of Faber's drawing-pensils; I reealy need
them," sed Amy decidedly.</p>

<p>"Muther didn't sae anything about our muny, and she wun't wish
us to giv up everything. Let's eech bie whut we wont, and hav a
litl fun; I'm shuur we wurk hard enough to urn it," cried Jo, examining
th heels of her shoos in a jentlmanly maner.</p>

<p>"I noe <em>I</em> do,—teeching thoes tiersum children neerly all dae,
when I'm longing to enjoy mieself at hoem," began Meg, in th complaening
toen again.</p>

<p>"U don't hav haf such a hard tiem as I do," sed Jo.
"How wuud U liek to be shut up for ours with a nurvus, fusy
oeld laedy, hoo keeps U troting, is never satisfied, and wurys U
till U're redy to fli out of th windo or cri?"</p>

<p>"It's nauty to fret; but I do think woshing dishes and keeping
things tidy is th wurst wurk in th wurld. It maeks me cros; and
mi hands get so stif, I can't practise wel at all;" and Beth luukt
at her ruf hands with a sie that any wun cuud heer that tiem.</p>

<p>"I don't beleev any of U sufer as I do," cried Amy; "for U
<span class="pagenum2">3</span>
don't hav to go to scool with impurtinent gurls, hoo plaeg U if
U don't noe yuur lesons, and laf at yuur dreses, and laebel
yuur faather if he isn't rich, and insult U when yuur noez isn't
niess."</p>

<p>
"If U meen <em>liebel</em>, I'd sae so, and not tauk about 
<em>laebels</em>, as if papa wuz a pikl-botl," advised Jo, lafing.</p>

<p>"I noe whut I meen, and U needn't be <em>statirical</em> 
about it. It's proper to uez guud wurds, and improov yuur <em>vocabilary</em>," 
returnd Amy, with dignity.</p>

<p>"Don't peck at wun anuther, children. Don't U wish we had th
muny papa lost when we wer litl, Jo? Deer me! how hapy and
guud we'd be, if we had no wurys!" sed Meg, hoo cuud remember
beter times.</p>

<p>"U sed th uther dae, U thaut we wer a deel hapyer than
th King children, for thae wer fieting and freting all th tiem, in
spiet of thaer muny."</p>

<p>"So I did, Beth. Wel, I think we ar; for, tho we do hav to
wurk, we maek fun for ourselvs, and ar a prity joly set, as Jo wuud
sae."</p>

<p>"Jo duz uez such slang wurds!" obzurvd Amy, with a rerooving
luuk at th long figuer strecht on th rug. Jo imeediatly sat up,
put her hands in her pokets, and began to whisl.</p>

<p>"Don't, Jo; it's so boyish!"</p>

<p>"That's whi I do it."</p>

<p>"I detest rood, unlady-liek gurls!"</p>

<p>"I haet affected, niminy-piminy chits!"</p>

<p>"'Burds in thaer litl nests agree,'" sang Beth, th peess-maeker,
with such a funy faess that boeth sharp voises sofend to a laf, and
th "pecking" ended for that tiem.</p>

<p>"Reealy, gurls, U ar boeth to be blaemd," sed Meg, begining to
lecture in her elder-sisterly fashon. "U ar oeld enough to leev
off boyish triks, and to behaev beter, Josephine. It didn't mater
so much when U wer a litl gurl; but now U ar so taul, and turn
up yuur haer, U should remember that U ar a yung laedy."</p>

<p>"I'm not! and if turning up mi haer maeks me wun, I'll waer it
in too taels till I'm twenty," cried Jo, puuling off her net, and shaeking
<span class="pagenum2">4</span>
doun a chestnut maen. "I haet to think I've got to gro up, and be
Mis March, and waer long gouns, and luuk as prim as a China-aster!
It's bad enough to be a gurl, anyway, when I liek boys' gaems and
wurk and maners! I can't get oever mi disapointment in not being
a boy; and it's wurss than ever now, for I'm dieing to go and fiet
with papa, and I can oenly stae at hoem and nit, liek a poky oeld
wuuman!" And Jo shuuk th bloo army-sok till th needls ratld
liek castanets, and her baul bounded acros th room.</p>

<p>"Puur Jo! It's too bad, but it can't be helpt; so U must tri
to be contented with maeking yuur naem boyish, and plaeing bruther
to us gurls," sed Beth, stroeking th ruf hed at her nee with a
hand that all th dish-woshing and dusting in th wurld cuud not
maek ungentle in its tuch.</p>

<p>"As for U, Amy," continued Meg, "U ar aultogether too particular
and prim. Yuur aers ar funy now; but U'll gro up an
affected litl gooss, if U don't taek caer. I liek yuur niess maners
and refiend waes of speeking, when U don't tri to be elegant; but
yuur absurd wurds ar as bad as Jo's slang."</p>

<p>"If Jo is a tom-boy and Amy a gooss, whut am I, pleez?" askt
Beth, redy to shaer th lecture.</p>

<p>"U're a deer, and nuthing else," anserd Meg wormly; and
no wun contradicted her, for th "Mous" wuz th pet of th
family.</p>

<p>As yung reeders liek to noe "how peepl luuk," we wil taek this
moement to giv them a litl skech of th foer sisters, hoo sat niting
away in th twilight, whiel th December sno fel qieetly without,
and th fier crakld cheerfuly within. It wuz a comfortable oeld
room, tho th carpet wuz faeded and th furnicher verry plaen; for a
guud pikcher or too hung on th wauls, books fild th reseses (vurb),
chrysanthemums and Christmas roezes bloomd in th windoes, and
a plezant atmosphere of hoem-peess pervaeded it.</p>

<p>Margaret, th eldest of th foer, wuz sixteen, and verry prity, being
plump and faer, with larj ies, plenty of soft, broun haer, a sweet
mouth, and whiet hands, of which she wuz rather vaen. Fifteen-yeer-oeld
Jo wuz verry taul, thin, and broun, and remiended wun of a colt; for
she never seemd to noe whut to do with her long lims, which wer
<span class="pagenum2">5</span>
verry much in her wae. She had a desieded mouth, a comikal noez,
and sharp, grae ies, which apeerd to see everything, and wer by
turns feerss, funy, or thautful. Her long, thik haer wuz her wun
buety; but it wuz uezhualy bundled into a net, to be out of her wae.
Round shoulders had Jo, big hands and feet, a fli-away luuk to her
cloeths, and th uncumfortabl apeeranss of a gurl hoo wuz rapidly
shooting up into a wuuman, and didn't liek it. Elizabeth—or Beth,
as every wun called her—wuz a roezy, smooth-haired, briet-ied gurl
of thurteen, with a shi maner, a timid vois, and a peaceful expreshon,
which wuz seldom disturbs. Her faather called her "Litl
Tranquillity," and th naem suited her exselently; for she seemd to
liv in a hapy wurld of her oen, oenly venturing out to meet th fue
hoom she trusted and luvd. Amy, tho th yunggest, wuz a moest
important purson,—in her oen opinyon at leest. A reguelar sno-maeden,
with bloo ies, and yelo haer, curling on her shoulders, pale
and slender, and aulwaes carrying herself liek a yung laedy miendful of
her maners. Whut th carrakters of th foer sisters wer we wil
leev to be found out.</p>

<p>Th clok struk six; and,
having swept up th harth,
Beth put a paer of slipers
doun to worm. Sumhow th
siet of th oeld shoos had a
guud efekt upon th gurls; for
muther wuz cuming, and every
wun brietend to welcum
her. Meg stopt lecturing,
and lieted th lamp, Amy
got out of th eezy-chaer
without being askt, and Jo
forgot how tierd she wuz as
she sat up to hoeld th slipers
neerer to th blaez.</p>

<p>"Thae ar qiet worn out;
Marmee must hav a nue
paer."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">6</span>
"I thaut I'd get her sum with mi dolar," sed Beth.</p>

<p>"No, I shal!" cried Amy.</p>

<p>"I'm th oeldest," began Meg, but Jo cut in with a desieded—</p>

<p>"I'm th man of th family now papa is away, and <em>I</em> shal provide
th slipers, for he toeld me to taek speshal caer of muther whiel he
wuz gon."</p>

<p>"I'll tel U whut we'll do," sed Beth; "let's eech get her sumthing
for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselvs."</p>

<p>"That's liek U, deer! Whut wil we get?" exclaemd Jo.</p>

<p>Every wun thaut soeberly for a mienuet; then Meg anounst, as
if th iedeea wuz sugjested by th siet of her oen prity hands, "I
shal giv her a niess paer of gluvs."</p>

<p>"Army shoos, best to be had," cried Jo.</p>

<p>"Sum hankerchifs, all hemd," sed Beth.</p>

<p>"I'll get a litl botl of cologne; she lieks it, and it wun't cost
much, so I'll hav sum left to bie mi pensils," aded Amy.</p>

<p>"How wil we giv th things?" askt Meg.</p>

<p>"Put them on th taebl, and bring her in and see her oepen
th bundles. Don't U remember how we uezd to do on our
burthdaes?" anserd Jo.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a name="b009.png" id="b009.png"></a>
<img src="./LitlWimen_files/b009.png" alt="I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big chair" title="I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big chair">
</div>

<p>"I uezd to be <em>so</em> frietend
when it wuz mi turn to sit in
th big chaer with th croun
on, and see U all cum
marching round to giv th
prezents, with a kis. I liked
th things and th kises, but
it wuz dredful to hav U
sit luuking at me whiel I
oepend th bundles," sed
Beth, hoo wuz toesting her faess and th bred for tee, at th saem tiem.</p>

<p>"Let Marmee think we ar geting things for ourselvs, and then
serpriez her. We must go shoping to-morro afternoon, Meg;
thaer is so much to do about th plae for Christmas niet," sed Jo,
marching up and doun, with her hands behind her bak and her noez
in th aer.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">7</span>
"I don't meen to akt any mor after this tiem; I'm geting too
oeld for such things," obzurvd Meg, hoo wuz as much a chield as ever
about "dresing-up" froliks.</p>

<p>"U wun't stop, I noe, as long as U can trael round in a whiet
goun with yuur haer doun, and waer goeld-paeper jooelry. U ar
th best aktres we've got, and thaer'll be an end of everything if
U qit th bords," sed Jo. "We aut to rehurss to-niet.
Cum heer, Amy, and do th faenting seen, for U ar as stif as a
poeker in that."</p>

<p>"I can't help it; I never saw any wun faent, and I don't chooz to
maek mieself all blak and bloo, tumbling flat as U do. If I can go
doun eezily, I'll drop; if I can't, I shal faul into a chaer and be
graesful; I don't caer if Hugo duz cum at me with a pistol,"
returnd Amy, hoo wuz not gifted with dramatik power, but wuz
choezen because she wuz small enough to be borne out shreeking by
th vilan of th peess.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a name="b010.png" id="b010.png"></a>
<img src="./LitlWimen_files/b010.png" alt="Do it this way, clasp your hands so" title="Do it this way, clasp your hands so">
</div>

<p>"Do it this wae; clasp yuur
hands so, and stager acros
th room, crieing frantikaly,
'Roderigo! saev me! saev
me!'" and away went Jo,
with a melodramatik screem
which wuz truly thriling.</p>

<p>Amy foloed, but she
poekt her hands out stifly
befor her, and jurkt herself
along as if she went by
masheenery; and her "Ow!"
wuz mor suggestive of pins
being run into her than of feer and anguish. Jo gaev a despaering
groen, and Meg laft outriet, whiel Beth let her bred burn
as she wocht th fun, with interest.</p>

<p>"It's no uez! Do th best U can when th tiem cums, and if
th audi’enss laf, don't blaem me. Cum on, Meg."</p>

<p>Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied th wurld in a
speech of too paejes without a singgl braek; Hagar, th wich, chanted
<span class="pagenum2">8</span>
an auful incantaeshon oever her kettleful of simering toeds, with weerd
efekt; Roderigo rent his chaens asunder manfuly, and Hugo died in
agonies of remorss and arsenic, with a wield "Haa! haa!"</p>

<p>"It's th best we've had yet," sed Meg, as th ded vilan sat
up and rubd his elboes.</p>

<p>"I don't see how U can riet and akt such splendid things, Jo.
U're a reguelar Shakespeare!" exclaemd Beth, hoo furmly beleevd
that her sisters wer gifted with wunderful jeenyus in all things.</p>

<p>"Not qiet," replied Jo modestly. "I do think 'Th Wich's
Curss, an Operatik Trajedy,' is rather a niess thing; but I'd liek to
tri Macbeth, if we oenly had a trap-dor for Banquo. I aulwaes wontedw
to do th kiling part. 'Is that a dager that I see befor me?'"
muterd Jo, roeling her ies and clutching at th aer, as she had
seen a faemus tragedian do.</p>

<p>"No, it's th toesting fork, with muther's shoo on it insted of th
bred. Beth's staej-struk!" cried Meg, and th rehursal ended in
a jeneral burst of lafter.</p>

<p>"Glad to fiend U so merry, mi gurls," sed a cheery vois at th
dor, and aktors and audi’enss turnd to welcum a taul, mutherly
laedy, with a "can-I-help-U" luuk about her which wuz truly delietful.
She wuz not elegantly drest, but a noebl-luuking wuuman, and
th gurls thaut th grae cloek and unfashonabl bonnet cuverd th
moest splendid muther in th wurld.</p>

<p>"Wel, dearies, how hav U got on to-dae? Thaer wuz so much
to do, geting th boxes redy to go to-morro, that I didn't cum
hoem to diner. Has any wun called, Beth? How is yuur coeld,
Meg? Jo, U luuk tierd to deth. Cum and kis me, baeby."</p>

<p>Whiel maeking thees maturnal inqierys Mrs. March got her wet
things off, her worm slipers on, and sitting doun in th eezy-chaer,
droo Amy to her lap, prepaering to enjoy th hapyest our of her
busy dae. Th gurls floo about, trieing to maek things comfortable,
eech in her oen wae. Meg araenjd th tee-taebl; Jo brought wuud
and set chaers, droping, oeverturning, and clatering everything she
tucht; Beth trotted to and fro between parlor and kichen, qieet
and busy; whiel Amy gaev direkshons to every wun, as she sat with
her hands foelded.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">9</span>
As thae gatherd about th taebl, Mrs. March sed, with a particularly
hapy faess, "I've got a treat for U after super."</p>

<p>A qik, briet smiel went round liek a streek of sunshine. Beth
clapt her hands, regardles of th biskit she held, and Jo tost up
her napkin, crieing, "A leter! a leter! Three cheers for faather!"</p>

<p>"Yes, a niess long leter. He is wel, and thinks he shal get
thru th coeld seezon beter than we feerd. He sends all sorts of
luving wishes for Christmas, and an especial mesej to U gurls,"
sed Mrs. March, pating her poket as if she had got a treasure
thaer.</p>

<p>"Hurry and get dun! Don't stop to qurk yuur litl fingger, and
simper oever yuur plaet, Amy," cried Jo, choeking in her tee, and
droping her bred, buter sied doun, on th carpet, in her haest to
get at th treat.</p>

<p>Beth aet no mor, but crept away, to sit in her shadoey corner
and brood oever th deliet to cum, till th others wer redy.</p>

<p>"I think it wuz so splendid in faather to go as a chaplin when he
wuz too oeld to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soeljer,"
sed Meg wormly.</p>

<p>"Don't I wish I cuud go as a drumer, a 
<em>vivan</em>—whut's its naem? or a nurss, so I cuud be neer him and 
help him," exclaemd Jo, with a groen.</p>

<p>"It must be verry disagreeabl to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts
of bad-taesting things, and drink out of a tin mug," sighed Amy.</p>

<p>"When wil he cum hoem, Marmee?" askt Beth, with a litl
qiver in her vois.</p>

<p>"Not for meny munths, deer, unles he is sik. He wil stae and
do his wurk faethfuly as long as he can, and we wun't ask for him
bak a mienuet sooner than he can be spaerd. Now cum and heer
th leter."</p>

<p>Thae all droo to th fier, muther in th big chaer with Beth at her
feet, Meg and Amy purcht on eether arm of th chaer, and Jo leening
on th bak, whaer no wun wuud see any sien of emotion if th
leter should hapen to be tuching.</p>

<p>Verry fue leters wer riten in thoes hard times that wer not
tuching, especially thoes which faathers sent hoem. In this wun litl
<span class="pagenum2">10</span>
wuz sed of th hardships
enduurd, th dangers faest,
or th hoemsiknes conkerd;
it wuz a cheerful,
hoepful leter, fuul of lievly
descripshons of camp lief,
marches, and militaery nues;
and oenly at th end did th
rieter's hart oeverflo with
faatherly luv and longing for
th litl gurls at hoem.</p>

<p>"Giv them all mi deer
luv and a kis. Tel them
I think of them by dae, prae
for them by niet, and fiend
mi best cumfort in thaer
affection at all times. A yeer seems verry long to waet befor I see
them, but remiend them that whiel we waet we mae all wurk, so that
thees hard daes need not be waested. I noe thae wil remember

thaer duty faethfuly, fiet thaer bosom enemys bravely, and conker
themselvs so beautifully, that when I cum bak to them I
mae be fonder and prouder than ever of mi litl wimen."</p>

<p>Everybody snift when thae caem to that part; Jo wasn't ashamed
of th graet teer that dropt off th end of her noez, and Amy never
miended th rumpling of her curls as she hid her faess on her muther's
shoulder and sobd out, "I <em>am</em> a selfish gurl! but I'll truly tri to be
beter, so he mayn't be disapointed in me by and by."</p>

<p>"We all wil!" cried Meg. "I think too much of mi luuks, and
haet to wurk, but wun't any mor, if I can help it."</p>

<p>"I'll tri and be whut he luvs to call me, 'a litl wuuman,' and not
be ruf and wield; but do mi duty heer insted of wonting to be
sumwhaer else," sed Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at hoem
wuz a much harder task than faesing a rebl or too doun South.</p>

<p>Beth sed nuthing, but wiept away her teers with th bloo army-sok,
and began to nit with all her miet, loozing no tiem in dooing
<span class="pagenum2">11</span>
th duty that lae neerest her, whiel she

<p>Mrs. March broek th silence that
foloed Jo's wurds, by saeing in her
cheery vois, "Do U remember how
U uezd to plae Pilgrim's Progres
when U wer litl things? Nuthing
delieted U mor than to hav me
tie mi peess-bags on yuur baks for

th hous from th selar, which wuz th
Sity of Destrukshon, up, up, to th

<p>"Whut fun it wuz, especially going
by th lieons, fieting Apollyon, and pasing
thru th Valy whaer th hobgoblins

<p>"I liked th plaess whaer th bundles

Meg.</p>

<p>"Mi faevorit part wuz when we caem
out on th flat roof whaer our flowers

if that plezant moement had cum bak

<p>"I don't remember much about it,
exsept that I wuz afraed of th selar
and th dark entry, and aulwaes liked
<span class="pagenum2">12</span>
th caek and milk we had up at th top. If I wasn't too oeld for
such things, I'd rather liek to plae it oever again," sed Amy, hoo began
to tauk of renounsing chieldish things at th matuur aej of twelve.</p>

<p>"We never ar too oeld for this, mi deer, because it is a plae we
ar plaeing all th tiem in wun wae or anuther. Our burdens ar
heer, our roed is befor us, and th longing for guudnes and hapynes
is th gied that leeds us thru meny trubls and mistaeks to
th peess which is a troo Seleschal Sity. Now, mi litl pilgrims,
supoez U begin again, not in plae, but in urnest, and see how far

<p>"Yes, I hav; mien is dishes and dusters, and envying gurls with

<p>Beth's bundle wuz such a funy wun that everybody wontedw to
laf; but noebody did, for it wuud hav hurt her feelings verry
much.</p>

<p>"Let us do it," sed Meg thautfuly. "It is oenly anuther naem
for trieing to be guud, and th story mae help us; for tho we do
wont to be guud, it's hard wurk, and we forget, and don't do our
best."</p>

<p>"We wer in th Slough of Despond to-niet, and muther caem
and puuld us out as Help did in th book. We aut to hav our
roel of direkshons, liek Christian. Whut shal we do about that?"
askt Jo, delieted with th fansy which lent a litl roemanss to th
verry dul task of dooing her duty.</p>

<p>"Luuk under yuur piloes, Christmas morning, and U wil fiend
yuur gied-book," replied Mrs. March.</p>

<p>Thae taukt oever th nue plan whiel oeld Hannah cleerd th taebl;
then out caem th foer litl wurk-baskets, and th needls floo as
th gurls maed sheets for Ant March. It wuz uninteresting soeing,
but to-niet no wun grumbld. Thae adopted Jo's plan of dividing
th long seems into foer parts, and calling th qorters Europe, Asia,
Africa, and America, and in that wae got on capitally, especially when
<span class="pagenum2">13</span>
thae taukt about th diferent cuntrys as thae stitched thaer wae

<p>At nien thae stopt wurk, and sung, as uezhual, befor thae went

maeking a plezant accompaniment to th simpl songs thae sung.
Meg had a vois liek a floot, and she and her muther led th litl

<p class="h2a">A MERRY CHRISTMAS.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Jo</span> wuz th furst to waek in th grae daun of Christmas morning.
No stokings hung at th fierplaess, and for a moement she felt as
much disapointed as she did long ago, when her litl sok fel doun
because it wuz so cramd with guudys. Then she rememberd her
muther's promis, and, sliping her hand under her pilo, droo out
a litl crimson-cuverd book. She knew it verry wel, for it wuz that
buetiful oeld story of th best lief ever livd, and Jo felt that it wuz
a troo gied-book for any pilgrim going th long jurny. She woek
<span class="pagenum2">16</span>
Meg with a "Merry Christmas," and bade her see whut wuz under
her pilo. A green-cuverd book apeerd, with th saem pikcher
insied, and a fue wurds riten by thaer muther, which maed thaer
wun prezent verry precious in thaer ies. Prezently Beth and Amy
woek, to rumej and fiend thaer litl books aulso,—wun duv-culord,
th uther bloo; and all sat luuking at and tauking about them, whiel
th eest groo roezy with th cuming dae.</p>

<p>In spiet of her small vanitys, Margaret had a sweet and pious
naechuur, which unconshusly inflooenst her sisters, especially Jo, hoo
luvd her verry tenderly, and oebaed her because her advice wuz so
jently given.</p>

<p>"Gurls," sed Meg seeriusly, luuking from th tumbld hed besied
her to th too litl niet-capt wuns in th room beyond,
"muther wonts us to red and luv and miend thees books, and we
must begin at wunss. We uezd to be faethful about it; but sinss
faather went away, and all this wor trubl unsetld us, we hav neglekted
meny things. U can do as U pleez; but <em>I</em> shal keep
mi book on th taebl heer, and red a litl every morning as soon
as I waek, for I noe it wil do me guud, and help me thru th
dae."</p>

<p>Then she oepend her nue book and began to red. Jo put her
arm round her, and, leening cheek to cheek, red aulso, with th qieet
expreshon so seldom seen on her restles faess.</p>

<p>"How guud Meg is! Cum, Amy, let's do as thae do. I'll help
U with th hard wurds, and thae'll explaen things if we don't understand,"
whisperd Beth, verry much imprest by th prity books
and her sisters' exampl.</p>

<p>"I'm glad mien is bloo," sed Amy; and then th rooms wer
verry still whiel th paejes wer softly turnd, and th winter sunshine
crept in to tuch th briet heds and seerius faeses with a Christmas
greeting.</p>

<p>"Whaer is muther?" askt Meg, as she and Jo ran doun to thank
her for thaer gifts, haf an our laeter.</p>

<p>"Guudnes oenly noes. Sum puur creeter cum a-beggin', and
yuur maa went straet off to see whut wuz needed. Thaer never <em>wuz</em>
such a wuuman for givin' away vittles and drink, cloeths and firin'," replied
<span class="pagenum2">17</span>
Hannah, hoo had livd with th family sinss Meg wuz born,
and wuz considerd by them all mor as a frend than a survant.</p>

<p>"She wil be bak soon, I think; so fri yuur cakes, and hav
everything redy," sed Meg, luuking oever th prezents which wer
colekted in a basket and kept under th soefa, redy to be produced
at th proper tiem. "Whi, whaer is Amy's botl of cologne?" she
aded, as th litl flask did not apeer.</p>

<p>"She tuuk it out a mienuet ago, and went off with it to put a ribon
on it, or sum such noeshon," replied Jo, dansing about th room to
taek th furst stiffness off th nue army-slipers.</p>

<p>"How niess mi hankerchifs luuk, don't thae? Hannah wosht
and ieernd them for me, and I markt them all mieself," sed Beth,
luuking proudly at th sumwhot uneeven leters which had cost her
such laebor.</p>

<p>"Bles th chield! she's gon and put 'Muther' on them insted
of 'M. March.' How funy!" cried Jo, taeking up wun.</p>

<p>"Isn't it riet? I thaut it wuz beter to do it so, because Meg's
inishals ar 'M. M.,' and I don't wont any wun to uez thees but Marmee,"
sed Beth, luuking trubld.</p>

<p>"It's all riet, deer, and a verry prity iedeea,—qiet sensibl, too,
for no wun can ever mistaek now. It wil pleez her verry much, I
noe," sed Meg, with a froun for Jo and a smiel for Beth.</p>

<p>"Thaer's muther. Hied th basket, qik!" cried Jo, as a dor
slamd, and steps sounded in th haul.</p>

<p>Amy caem in haestily, and luukt rather abasht when she saw her
sisters all waeting for her.</p>

<p>"Whaer hav U been, and whut ar U hieding behind U?"
askt Meg, serpriezd to see, by her huud and cloek, that laezy Amy
had been out so eerly.</p>

<p>"Don't laf at me, Jo! I didn't meen any wun should noe till
th tiem caem. I oenly ment to chaenj th litl botl for a big wun,
and I gaev <em>all</em> mi muny to get it, and I'm truly trieing not to be
selfish any mor."</p>

<p>As she spoek, Amy shoed th handsum flask which replaest th
cheep wun; and luukt so urnest and humbl in her litl efort to
forget herself that Meg hugd her on th spot, and Jo pronounced
<span class="pagenum2">18</span>
her "a trump," whiel Beth ran to th windo, and pikt her fienest
roez to ornament th stately botl.</p>

<p>"U see I felt ashamed of mi prezent, after reeding and tauking
about being guud this morning, so I ran round th corner and
chaenjd it th mienuet I wuz up: and I'm <em>so</em> glad, for mien is th
hansumest now."</p>

<p>Anuther bang of th street-dor sent th basket under th soefa, and
th gurls to th taebl, eeger for brekfast.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas, Marmee! Meny of them! Thank U for our
books; we red sum, and meen to every dae," thae cried, in corus.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas, litl dauters! I'm glad U began at wunss,
and hoep U wil keep on. But I wont to sae wun wurd befor we
sit doun. Not far away from heer lies a puur wuuman with a litl
nue-born baeby. Six children ar hudld into wun bed to keep from
freezing, for thae hav no fier. Thaer is nuthing to eat oever thaer;
and th oeldest boy caem to tel me thae wer sufering hungger and
coeld. Mi gurls, wil U giv them yuur brekfast as a Christmas
prezent?"</p>

<p>Thae wer all unuezhualy hunggry, having waeted neerly an our, and
for a mienuet no wun spoek; oenly a mienuet, for Jo exclaemd impechu’usly,—</p>

<p>"I'm so glad U caem befor we began!"</p>

<p>"Mae I go and help carry th things to th puur litl children?"
askt Beth, eegerly.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> shal taek th creem and th mufins," aded Amy, 
heroeikaly giving up th artikls she moest liked.</p>

<p>Meg wuz aulredy cuvering th buckwheats, and pieling th bred
into wun big plaet.</p>

<p>"I thaut U'd do it," sed Mrs. March, smieling as if satisfied.
"U shal all go and help me, and when we cum bak we wil hav
bred and milk for brekfast, and maek it up at diner-tiem."</p>

<p>Thae wer soon redy, and th procession set out. Forchunatly it
wuz eerly, and thae went thru bak streets, so fue peepl saw
them, and no wun laft at th qeer party.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="b016.png" id="b016.png"></a>
<img src="./LitlWimen_files/b016.png" alt="The procession set out" title="The procession set out">
</div>

<p>A puur, baer, mizerabl room it wuz, with broeken windoes, no fier,
raged bed-cloeths, a sik muther, waeling baeby, and a groop of
<span class="pagenum2">19</span>
pale, hunggry children cudld under wun oeld qilt, trieing to keep
worm.</p>

<p>How th big ies staerd and th bloo lips smield as th gurls
went in!</p>

<p>"Ach, mein Gott! it is guud aenjels cum to us!" sed th puur
wuuman, crieing for joy.</p>

<p>"Funy aenjels in huuds and mitens," sed Jo, and set them
lafing.</p>

<p>In a fue minits it reealy did seem as if kiend spirits had been at
wurk thaer. Hannah, hoo had carried wuud, maed a fier, and
stopt up th broeken panes with oeld hats and her oen cloek. Mrs.
March gaev th muther tee and grooel, and cumforted her with
promises of help, whiel she drest th litl baeby as tenderly as if
it had been her oen. Th gurls, meentiem, spred th taebl, set
th children round th fier, and fed them liek so meny hunggry
burds,—lafing, tauking, and trieing to understand th funy broeken
English.</p>

<p>"Das ist gut!" "Die Engel-kiender!" cried th puur things, as
thae aet, and wormd thaer purpl hands at th comfortable blaez.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">20</span>
Th gurls had never been called aenjel children befor, and thaut
it verry agreeabl, especially Jo, hoo had been considerd a "Sancho"
ever sinss she wuz born. That wuz a verry hapy brekfast, tho
thae didn't get any of it; and when thae went away, leeving cumfort
behind, I think thaer wer not in all th sity foer merryer peepl than
th hunggry litl gurls hoo gaev away thaer breakfasts and contented
themselvs with bred and milk on Christmas morning.</p>

<p>"That's luving our naebor beter than ourselvs, and I liek it,"
sed Meg, as thae set out thaer prezents, whiel thaer muther wuz upstaers
colekting cloeths for th puur Hummels.</p>

<p>Not a verry splendid sho, but thaer wuz a graet deel of luv dun
up in th fue litl bundles; and th taul vaess of red roezes, whiet
chrysanthemums, and traeling viens, which stuud in th midl, gaev
qiet an elegant aer to th taebl.</p>

<p>"She's cuming! Striek up, Beth! Oepen th dor, Amy! Three
cheers for Marmee!" cried Jo, pransing about, whiel Meg went to
conduct muther to th seet of onor.</p>

<p>Beth plaed her gayest march, Amy throo oepen th dor, and Meg
enakted escort with graet dignity. Mrs. March wuz boeth serpriezd
and tucht; and smield with her ies fuul as she examind her
prezents, and red th litl noets which accompanied them. Th
slipers went on at wunss, a nue hankerchif wuz slipt into her
poket, wel sented with Amy's cologne, th roez wuz fasend
in her bosom, and th niess gluvs wer pronounced a "perfect
fit."</p>

<p>Thaer wuz a guud deel of lafing and kissing and explaening, in
th simpl, luving fashon which maeks thees hoem-festivals so plezant
at th tiem, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all
fel to wurk.</p>

<p>Th morning charritys and serremoenys tuuk so much tiem that
th rest of th dae wuz devoeted to preparaeshons for th evening festivitys.
Being still too yung to go ofen to th theeater, and not
rich enough to afford any graet outlae for private performances, th
gurls put thaer wits to wurk, and—nesesity being th muther of invenshon,—maed
whotever thae needed. Verry clever wer sum of thaer
produkshons,—pasteboard gitars, anteek lamps maed of oeld-fashond
<span class="pagenum2">21</span>
buter-boets cuverd with silver paeper, gorjus roebs of oeld coton,
glitering with tin spangles from a pikl faktory, and armor cuverd
with th saem uesful diemond-shaept bits, left in sheets when th
lids of tin prezurv-pots wer cut out. Th furnicher wuz uezd to
being turnd topsy-turvy, and th big chaember wuz th seen of
meny inosent revels.</p>

<p>No jentlmen wer admited; so Jo plaed mael parts to her
hart's content, and tuuk imenss satisfakshon in a paer of ruset-lether
boots given her by a frend, hoo knew a laedy hoo knew an
aktor. Thees boots, an oeld foil, and a slashed doublet wunss uezd by
an artist for sum pikcher, wer Jo's cheef treasures, and apeerd on
all ocaezhons. Th smallness of th company maed it nesesaery for
th too prinsipal aktors to taek several parts apeess; and thae surtenly
dezurvd sum credit for th hard wurk thae did in lurning
three or foer diferent parts, whisking in and out of vaerius costumes,
and manejing th staej besieds. It wuz exselent dril for thaer
memorys, a harmles amuezment, and employed meny ours which
utherwiez wuud hav been iedl, loenly, or spent in les profitabl
soesieety.</p>

<p>On Christmas niet, a duzen gurls pield on to th bed which wuz
th dres-surkl, and sat befor th bloo and yelo chintz curtens
in a moest flatering staet of expectancy. Thaer wuz a guud deel of
rusling and whispering behind th curten, a trifle of lamp-smoek,
and an ocaezhonal gigl from Amy, hoo wuz apt to get histerrikal in
th exsietment of th moement. Prezently a bel sounded, th curtens
floo apart, and th Operatik Trajedy began.</p>

<p>"A gloomy wuud," acording to th wun plae-bil, wuz reprezented
by a fue shrubs in pots, green baize on th flor, and a caev in th
distanss. This caev wuz maed with a cloeths-horss for a roof, bureaus
for wauls; and in it wuz a small furnis in fuul blast, with a blak pot
on it, and an oeld wich bending oever it. Th staej wuz dark, and th
glo of th furnis had a fien efekt, especially as reeal steem ishood
from th ketl when th wich tuuk off th cuver. A moement wuz
alowd for th furst thril to subside; then Hugo, th vilan, staukt
in with a clanking sord at his sied, a slouched hat, blak beard,
misteerius cloek, and th boots. After paesing to and fro in much
<span class="pagenum2">22</span>
ajitaeshon, he struk his forhed, and burst out in a wield straen,
singing of his haetred to Roderigo, his luv for Zara, and his pleezing
rezolooshon to kil th wun and win th uther. Th gruf toens of
Hugo's vois, with an ocaezhonal shout when his feelings oevercaem
him, wer verry impresiv,
and th audi’enss
aplauded th moement
he paused for breth.
Bowing with th aer of
wun accustomed to public
praez, he stoel to
th cavern, and orderd
Hagar to cum forth
with a comanding
"Whut ho, minyon! I
need thee!"</p>

Hagar, in a fien

<p>A soft straen of muezik sounded, and then at th bak of th caev
apeerd a litl figuer in cloudy whiet, with glitering wings, goelden

<p class="noindent">And, droping a small, gilded botl
at th wich's feet, th spirit
vanisht. Anuther chant from
Hagar produced anuther apparition,—not
a luvly wun; for, with
a bang, an ugly blak imp apeerd,
and, having croekt a replie,
tost a dark botl at Hugo,
and disapeerd with a moking
laf. Having worbld his thanks
and put th poeshons in his boots,
Hugo departed; and Hagar informd
th audi’enss that, as he
had kild a fue of her frends in
times past, she has curst him,
and intends to thwort his plans, and be revenjd on him. Then
th curten fel, and th audi’enss repoezd and aet candy whiel discusing
th merits of th plae.</p>

<p>A guud deel of hamering went on befor th curten roez again;
but when it becaem evident whut a masterpeess of staej-carpentering
had been got up, no wun murmerd at th delae. It wuz truly superb!
A tower roez to th seeling; haf-wae up apeerd a windo, with a
lamp burning at it, and behind th whiet curten apeerd Zara in a
luvly bloo and silver dres, waeting for Roderigo. He caem in gorjus
arae, with plumed cap, red cloek, chestnut luv-loks, a gitar,
and th boots, of corss. Neeling at th fuut of th tower, he sang
<span class="pagenum2">24</span>
a serenaed in melting toens. Zara replied, and, after a muezikal diealog,
consented to fli. Then caem th grand efekt of th plae.
Roderigo produced a roep-lader, with fiev steps to it, throo up wun
end, and invieted Zara to desend. Timidly she crept from her latis,
put her hand on Roderigo's shoulder, and wuz about to leep graesfuly
doun, when, "Alas! alas for Zara!" she forgot her traen,—it caut
in th windo; th tower tottered, leend forward, fel with a crash,
and berryd th unhapy luvers in th rooins!</p>

<p>A uenivursal shreek aroez as th ruset boots waevd wieldly from th
rek, and a goelden hed emerged, exclaeming, "I toeld U so! I
toeld U so!" With wunderful presence of miend, Don Pedro, th
crooel sier, rusht in, dragd out his dauter, with a hasty asied,—</p>

<p>"Don't laf! Akt as if it wuz all riet!"—and, ordering Roderigo
up, banisht him from th kingdom with rath and scorn.
Tho decidedly shaeken by th faul of th tower upon him, Roderigo
defied th oeld jentlman, and refuezd to stur. This dauntles exampl
fierd Zara: she aulso defied her sier, and he orderd them boeth to th
deepest dunjons of th casl. A stout litl retaener caem in with
chaens, and led them away, luuking verry much frietend, and evidently
forgeting th speech he aut to hav maed.</p>

<p>Akt thurd wuz th casl haul; and heer Hagar apeerd, having
cum to free th luvers and finish Hugo. She heers him cuming, and
hieds; sees him put th poeshons into too cups of wien, and bid th
timid litl survant "Baer them to th captivs in thaer sels, and tel
them I shal cum anon." Th survant taeks Hugo asied to tel him
sumthing, and Hagar chaenjes th cups for too others which ar
harmles. Ferdinando, th "minyon," carries them away, and Hagar
puts bak th cup which hoelds th poizon ment for Roderigo. Hugo,
geting thursty after a long worbl, drinks it, loozes his wits, and, after a
guud deel of clutching and stamping, fauls flat and dies; whiel Hagar
informs him whut she has dun in a song of exqizit power and
melody.</p>

<p>This wuz a truly thriling seen, tho sum pursons miet hav
thaut that th suden tumbling doun of a qontity of long haer
rather mard th efekt of th vilan's deth. He wuz called befor
th curten, and with graet propriety apeerd, leeding Hagar, hoos
<span class="pagenum2">25</span>
singing wuz considerd mor wunderful than all th rest of th performance
put together.</p>

<p>Akt foerth displaed th despaering Roderigo on th pointer of stabing
himself, because he has been toeld that Zara has dezurted him.
Just as th dager is at his hart, a luvly song is sung under his
windo, informing him that Zara is troo, but in daenjer, and he can
saev her, if he wil. A kee is throen in, which unloks th dor, and
in a spazm of rapcher he teers off his chaens, and rushes away to fiend
and rescue his laedy-luv.</p>

<p>Akt fifth oepend with a stormy seen between Zara and Don Pedro.
He wishes her to go into a convent, but she wun't heer of it; and,
after a tuching apeel, is about to faent, when Roderigo dashes in
and demands her hand. Don Pedro refuezes, because he is not rich.
<span class="pagenum2">26</span>
Thae shout and jesticuelaet tremendously, but cannot agree, and Roderigo
is about to baer away th exausted Zara, when th timid survant
enters with a leter and a bag from Hagar, hoo has misteeriusly disapeerd.
Th later informs th party that she beqeeths untoeld
welth to th yung paer, and an auful doom to Don Pedro, if he
doesn't maek them hapy. Th bag is oepend, and several qorts
of tin muny shower doun upon th staej, till it is qiet glorified with
th gliter. This entierly sofens th "sturn sier": he consents without
a murmer, all join in a joyful corus, and th curten fauls upon
th luvers neeling to reseev Don Pedro's blesing in atitoods of th
moest roemantik graess.</p>

<p>Toomulchu'us aplauz foloed, but reseevd an unexpekted chek;
for th cot-bed, on which th "dres-surkl" wuz bilt, sudenly shut
up, and extinguished th enthusiastic audi’enss. Roderigo and Don
Pedro floo to th rescue, and all wer taeken out unhurt, tho meny
wer speechles with lafter. Th exsietment had hardly subsided,
when Hannah apeerd, with "Mrs. March's compliments, and wuud
th laedys wauk doun to super."</p>

<p>This wuz a serpriez, eeven to th aktors; and, when thae saw th
taebl, thae luukt at wun anuther in rapcherus amaezment. It wuz

as this wuz unhurd-of sinss th departed daes of plenty. Thaer
wuz iess-creem,—akchualy too dishes of it, pink and whiet,—and
caek and froot and distracting French bonbons, and, in th midl of
th taebl, foer graet bouquets of hot-hous flowers!</p>

<p>It qiet tuuk thaer breth away; and thae staerd furst at th taebl

grae beard and whiet iebrows.</p>

<p>"Ant March had a guud fit, and sent th super," cried Jo, with
a suden inspiraeshon.</p>

<p>"All rong. Oeld Mr. Laurence sent it," replied Mrs. March.</p>

<p>"Th Laurence boy's grandfaather! Whut in th wurld put such a
thing into his hed? We don't noe him!" exclaemd Meg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">27</span>
"Hannah toeld wun of his survants about yuur brekfast party. He

and th iess began to melt out of siet, with "Ohs!" and "Ahs!"
of satisfakshon.</p>

<p>"U meen th peepl hoo liv in th big hous next dor, don't

tho he never speeks to us gurls."</p>

<p>"Our cat ran away wunss, and he brought her bak, and we taukt

And Meg examind her flowers with graet interest.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smc">Jo! Jo!</span> whaer ar U?" cried Meg, at th fuut of th garret
staers.</p>

<p>"Heer!" anserd a husky vois from abuv; and, runing up,
Meg found her sister eating apples and crieing oever th "Aer of
Redclyffe," rapt up in a comforter on an oeld three-leged soefa by
th suny windo. This wuz Jo's faevorit refuej; and heer she
luvd to retier with haf a duzen russets and a niess book, to enjoy th
qieet and th soesieety of a pet rat hoo livd neer by, and didn't miend
her a partikl. As Meg apeerd, Scrabl whiskt into his hoel.
Jo shuuk th teers off her cheeks, and waeted to heer th nues.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">30</span>
"Such fun! oenly see! a reguelar noet of invitaeshon from Mrs. Gardiner
for to-morro niet!" cried Meg, waeving th precious paeper,
and then proceeding to red it, with gurlish deliet.</p>

<p>"'Mrs. Gardiner wuud be hapy to see Mis March and Mis
Josephine at a litl danss on Nue-Yeer's Eve.' Marmee is wiling
we should go; now whut <em>shal</em> we waer?"</p>

<p>"Whut's th uez of asking that, when U noe we shal waer
our poplins, because we haeven't got anything else?" anserd Jo,
with her mouth fuul.</p>

<p>"If I oenly had a silk!" sighed Meg. "Muther sez I mae when
I'm aeteen, perhaps; but too yeers is an everlasting tiem to waet."</p>

<p>"I'm shuur our pops luuk liek silk, and thae ar niess enough for
us. Yuurs is as guud as nue, but I forgot th burn and th teer in
mien. Whotever shal I do? th burn shoes badly, and I can't taek
any out."</p>

<p>"U must sit still all U can, and keep yuur bak out of siet;
th frunt is all riet. I shal hav a nue ribon for mi haer, and
Marmee wil lend me her litl pearl pin, and mi nue slipers ar
luvly, and mi gluvs wil do, tho thae aren't as niess as I'd
liek."</p>

<p>"Mien ar spoilt with lemonaed, and I can't get any nue wuns, so
I shal hav to go without," sed Jo, hoo never trubld herself much
about dres.</p>

<p>"U <em>must</em> hav gluvs, or I wun't go," cried Meg decidedly.
"Gluvs ar mor important than anything else; U can't danss
without them, and if U don't I should be <em>so</em> mortified."</p>

<p>"Then I'll stae still. I don't caer much for company dansing;
it's no fun to go saeling round; I liek to fli about and cut caepers."</p>

<p>"U can't ask muther for nue wuns, thae ar so expensive, and
U ar so careless. She sed, when U spoilt th others, that she
shouldn't get U any mor this winter. Can't U maek them do?"
askt Meg anxiously.</p>

<p>"I can hoeld them crumpld up in mi hand, so no wun wil noe
how staend thae ar; that's all I can do. No! I'll tel U how we
can manej—eech waer wun guud wun and carry a bad wun; don't
U see?"</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">31</span>
"Yuur hands ar biger than mien, and U wil strech mi gluv
dredfuly," began Meg, hoos gluvs wer a tender pointer with her.</p>

<p>"Then I'll go without. I don't caer whut peepl sae!" cried Jo,
taeking up her book.</p>

<p>"U mae hav it, U mae! oenly don't staen it, and do behaev
niesly. Don't put yuur hands behind U, or staer, or sae 'Christopher
Columbus!' wil U?"</p>

<p>"Don't wury about me; I'll be as prim as I can, and not get into
any scraeps, if I can help it. Now go and anser yuur noet, and let
me finish this splendid story."</p>

<p>So Meg went away to "accept with thanks," luuk oever her dres,
and sing blithely as she did up her wun reeal laess fril; whiel Jo finisht
her story, her foer apples, and had a gaem of romps with Scrabl.</p>

<p>On Nue-Yeer's Eve th parlor wuz dezurted, for th too yungger
<span class="pagenum2">32</span>
gurls plaed dresing-maeds, and th too elder wer absorbd in th
all-important business of "geting redy for th party." Simpl as
th toilets wer, thaer wuz a graet deel of runing up and doun,
lafing and tauking, and at wun tiem a strong smel of burnt haer
pervaeded th hous. Meg wontedw a fue curls about her faess, and Jo
undertuuk to pinch th paeperd loks with a paer of hot tongs.</p>

<p>"Aut thae to smoek liek that?" askt Beth, from her purch on
th bed.</p>

<p>"It's th dampnes drieing," replied Jo.</p>

<p>"Whut a qeer smel! it's liek burnt fethers," obzurvd Amy,
smoothing her oen prity curls with a superior aer.</p>

<p>"Thaer, now I'll taek off th paepers and U'll see a cloud of litl
ringlets," sed Jo, putting doun th tongs.</p>

<p>She did taek off th paepers, but no cloud of ringlets apeerd, for
th haer caem with th paepers, and th horrified haer-dreser laed a
row (noun) of litl scorcht bundles on th bureau befor her viktim.</p>

<p>"O, o, o! whut <em>hav</em> U dun? I'm spoilt! I can't go! Mi
haer, o, mi haer!" waeld Meg, luuking with despaer at th uneeven
frizl on her forhed.</p>

<p>"Just mi luk! U shouldn't hav askt me to do it; I aulwaes
spoil everything. I'm so sorry, but th tongs wer too hot, and so
I've maed a mes," groend puur Jo, regarding th blak pancaeks
with teers of regret.</p>

<p>"It isn't spoilt; just frizl it, and tie yuur ribon so th ends
cum on yuur forhed a bit, and it wil luuk liek th last fashon.
I've seen meny gurls do it so," sed Amy consolingly.</p>

<p>"Survs me riet for trieing to be fien. I wish I'd let mi haer
aloen," cried Meg petulantly.</p>

<p>"So do I, it wuz so smooth and prity. But it wil soon gro out
again," sed Beth, cuming to kis and cumfort th shorn sheep.</p>

<p>After vaerius leser mis-haps, Meg wuz finisht at last, and by th
uenieted exertions of th family Jo's haer wuz got up and her dres on.
Thae luukt verry wel in thaer simpl suits,—Meg in silvery drab, with
a bloo velvet snood, laess frils, and th pearl pin; Jo in maroon, with
a stif, jentlmanly linen collar, and a whiet chrysanthemum or too
for her oenly ornament. Eech put on wun niess liet gluv, and carried
<span class="pagenum2">33</span>
wun soild wun, and all pronounced th efekt "qiet eezy and fien."
Meg's hie-heeld slipers wer verry tight, and hurt her, tho she
wuud not oen it, and Jo's nienteen haer-pins all seemd stuk straet
into her hed, which wuz not exaktly comfortable; but, deer me, let
us be elegant or die!</p>

<p>"Hav a guud tiem, dearies!" sed Mrs. March, as th sisters went
daintily doun th wauk. "Don't eat much super, and cum away
at eleven, when I send Hannah for U." As th gaet clasht behind
them, a vois cried from a windo,—</p>

<p>"Gurls, gurls! <em>hav</em> U boeth got niess poket-hankerchifs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, spandy niess, and Meg has cologne on hers," cried Jo,
ading, with a laf, as thae went on, "I do beleev Marmee wuud
ask that if we wer all runing away from an urthqaek."</p>

<p>"It is wun of her aristocratic taests, and qiet proper, for a reeal
laedy is aulwaes noen by neet boots, gluvs, and hankerchif,"
replied Meg, hoo had a guud meny litl "aristocratic taests" of her
oen.</p>

<p>"Now don't forget to keep th bad bredth out of siet, Jo. Is mi
sash riet? and duz mi haer luuk <em>verry</em> bad?" sed Meg, as she
turnd from th glas in Mrs. Gardiner's dresing-room, after a prolonged
prink.</p>

<p>"I noe I shal forget. If U see me dooing anything rong, just
remiend me by a wink, wil U?" returnd Jo, giving her collar a
twitch and her hed a hasty brush.</p>

<p>"No, winking isn't laedy-liek; I'll lift mi iebrows if anything is
rong, and nod if U ar all riet. Now hoeld yuur shoulders
straet, and taek short steps, and don't shaek hands if U ar introduest
to any wun: it isn't th thing."</p>

<p>"How <em>do</em> U lurn all th proper waes? I never can. Isn't that

<p>Doun thae went, feeling a trifle timid, for thae seldom went to
partys, and, informal as this litl gathering wuz, it wuz an event to
them. Mrs. Gardiner, a stately oeld laedy, greeted them kiendly, and
handed them oever to th eldest of her six dauters. Meg knew
Sallie, and wuz at her eez verry soon; but Jo, hoo didn't caer much
for gurls or gurlish gosip, stuud about, with her bak carefully against
<span class="pagenum2">34</span>
th waul, and felt as much out of plaess as a colt in a flower-garden.
Haf a duzen joevial lads wer tauking about skaets in anuther part of
th room, and she longed to go and join them, for skaeting wuz wun
of th joys of her lief. She telegraft her wish to Meg, but th
iebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stur. No wun
caem to tauk to her, and wun by wun th groop neer her dwindled
away, till she wuz left aloen. She cuud not roem about and amuez
herself, for th burnt bredth wuud sho, so she staerd at peepl
rather forlornly till th dansing began. Meg wuz askt at wunss, and
th tight slipers tript about so briskly that nun wuud hav
guessed th paen thaer wearer suferd smilingly. Jo saw a big red-heded
yooth approaching her corner, and feering he ment to engaej
her, she slipt into a curtend resess (vurb), intending to peep and enjoy
herself in peess. Unforchunatly, anuther bashful purson had choezen
th saem refuej; for, as th curten fel behind her, she found herself
faess to faess with th "Laurence boy."</p>

<p>"Deer me, I didn't noe any wun wuz heer!" stamerd Jo,
prepaering to bak out as speedily as she had bounst in.</p>

<p>But th boy laft, and sed pleasantly, tho he luukt a litl

"Don't miend me; stae, if U liek."</p>

<p>"Sha'n't I disturb U?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit; I oenly caem heer because I don't noe meny peepl,
and felt rather straenj at furst, U noe."</p>

<p>"So did I. Don't go away, pleez, unles U'd rather."</p>

<p>Th boy sat doun again and luukt at his pumps, till Jo sed, trieing
to be poliet and eezy,—</p>

<p>"I think I've had th plezher of seeing U befor; U liv neer
us, don't U?"</p>

<p>"Next dor"; and he luukt up and laft outriet, for Jo's
prim maner wuz rather funy when he rememberd how thae had
chated about criket when he brought th cat hoem.</p>

<p>That put Jo at her eez; and she laft too, as she sed, in her
hartyest wae,—</p>

<p>"We did hav such a guud tiem oever yuur niess Christmas prezent."</p>

<p>"Grandpa sent it."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">36</span>
"But U put it into his hed, didn't U, now?"</p>

<p>"How is yuur cat, Mis March?" askt th boy, trieing to luuk

<p>"Niesly, thank U, Mr. Laurence; but I am not Mis March, I'm

<p>"I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm oenly Laurie."</p>

<p>"Laurie Laurence,—whut an od naem!"</p>

<p>"Mi furst naem is Theodore, but I don't liek it, for th feloes
called me Dora, so I maed them sae Laurie insted."</p>

<p>"I haet mi naem, too—so sentimental! I wish every wun wuud
sae Jo, insted of Josephine. How did U maek th boys stop
calling U Dora?"</p>

<p>"I thrasht 'em."</p>

<p>"I can't thrash Ant March, so I supoez I shal hav to baer it";
and Jo reziend herself with a sie.</p>

<p>"Don't U liek to danss, Mis Jo?" askt Laurie, luuking as if
he thaut th naem suited her.</p>

<p>"I liek it wel enough if thaer is plenty of room, and every wun is
lievly. In a plaess liek this I'm shuur to upset sumthing, tred on
peepl's toes, or do sumthing dredful, so I keep out of mischif,
and let Meg sael about. Don't U danss?"</p>

<p>"Sumtiems; U see I've been abraud a guud meny yeers, and
haeven't been into company enough yet to noe how U do things
heer."</p>

<p>"Abraud!" cried Jo. "O, tel me about it! I luv deerly to heer
peepl descrieb thaer travels."</p>

<p>Laurie didn't seem to noe whaer to begin; but Jo's eeger qeschons
soon set him going, and he toeld her how he had been at scool
in Vevay, whaer th boys never wor hats, and had a fleet of boets on
th laek, and for holidae fun went wauking trips about Switzerland
with thaer teechers.</p>

<p>"Don't I wish I'd been thaer!" cried Jo. "Did U go to
Paris?"</p>

<p>"We spent last winter thaer."</p>

<p>"Can U tauk French?"</p>

<p>"We wer not alowd to speek any thing else at Vevay."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">37</span>
"Do sae sum! I can red it, but can't pronounce."</p>

<p>"Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?" sed
Laurie guud-naturedly.</p>

<p>"How niesly U do it! Let me see,—U sed, 'Hoo is th
yung laedy in th prity slipers,' didn't U?"</p>

<p>"Oui, mademezel."</p>

<p>"It's mi sister Margaret, and U knew it wuz! Do U think she
is prity?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she maeks me think of th German gurls, she luuks so fresh
and qieet, and danses liek a laedy."</p>

<p>Jo qiet gloed with plezher at this boyish praez of her sister, and
stord it up to repeet to Meg. Boeth peept and criticised and chated,
till thae felt liek oeld acquaintances. Laurie's bashfulness soon
wor off; for Jo's jentlmanly demeanor amuezd and set him at
his eez, and Jo wuz her merry self again, because her dres wuz forgoten,
and noebody lifted thaer iebrows at her. She liked th
"Laurence boy" beter than ever, and tuuk several guud luuks at
him, so that she miet descrieb him to th gurls; for thae had no
bruthers, verry fue mael cuzins, and boys wer aulmoest unnoen
creechers to them.</p>

<p>"Curly blak haer; broun skin; big, blak ies; handsum noez;
fien teeth; small hands and feet; tauler than I am; verry poliet, for a
boy, and aultogether joly. Wunder how oeld he is?"</p>

<p>It wuz on th tip of Jo's tung to ask; but she chekt herself in
tiem, and, with uenuezhual takt, tried to fiend out in a roundabout wae.</p>

<p>"I supoez U ar going to colej soon? I see U peging
away at yuur books,—no, I meen studying hard"; and Jo blushed
at th dredful "peging" which had escaept her.</p>

<p>Laurie smield, but didn't seem shokt, and anserd, with a
shrug,—</p>

<p>"Not for a yeer or too; I wun't go befor seventeen, anyway."</p>

<p>"Aren't U but fifteen?" askt Jo, luuking at th taul lad, hoom
she had imajind seventeen aulredy.</p>

<p>"Sixteen, next munth."</p>

<p>"How I wish I wuz going to colej! U don't luuk as if U
liked it."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">38</span>

"I haet it! Nuthing but griending or skylarking. And I don't
liek th wae feloes do eether, in this cuntry."</p>

<p>"Whut do U liek?"</p>

<p>"To liv in Italy, and to enjoy mieself in mi oen wae."</p>

<p>Jo wontedw verry much to ask whut his oen wae wuz; but his blak
brows luukt rather thretening as he nit them; so she chaenjd th
subjekt by saeing, as her fuut kept tiem, "That's a splendid polka!
Whi don't U go and tri it?"</p>

<p>"If U wil cum too," he anserd, with a galant litl boe.</p>

<p>"I can't; for I toeld Meg I wouldn't, because—" Thaer Jo
stopt, and luukt undecided whether to tel or to laf.</p>

<p>"Because whut?" askt Laurie cueriusly.</p>

<p>"U wun't tel?"</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"Wel, I hav a bad trik of standing befor th fier, and so I burn
mi froks, and I scorcht this wun; and, tho it's niesly mended,
it shoes, and Meg toeld me to keep still, so no wun wuud see it. U
mae laf, if U wont to; it is funy, I noe."</p>

<p>But Laurie didn't laf; he oenly luukt doun a mienuet, and th
expreshon of his faess puzzled Jo, when he sed verry jently,—</p>

<p>"Never miend that; I'll tel U how we can manej: thaer's a
long haul out thaer, and we can danss grandly, and no wun wil see us.
Pleez cum?"</p>

<p>Jo thankt him, and gladly went, wishing she had too neet gluvs,
when she saw th niess, pearl-culord wuns her partner wor. Th
haul wuz empty, and thae had a grand polka; for Laurie danst wel,
and taut her th German step, which delieted Jo, being fuul of
swing and spring. When th muezik stopt, thae sat doun on th
staers to get thaer breth; and Laurie wuz in th midst of an account
of a stoodents' festival at Heidelberg, when Meg apeerd in surch of
her sister. She becond, and Jo reluktantly foloed her into a sied-room,
whaer she found her on a soefa, hoelding her fuut, and luuking
pale.</p>

<p>"I've spraend mi ankl. That stoopid hie heel turnd, and gaev
me a sad rench. It aeks so, I can hardly stand, and I don't
noe how I'm ever going to get hoem," she sed, roking to and
fro in paen.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">39</span>
"I knew U'd hurt yuur feet with thoes sily shoos. I'm sorry.
But I don't see whut U can do, exsept get a carrej, or stae
heer all niet," anserd Jo, softly rubing th puur ankl as she
spoek.</p>

<p>"I can't hav a carrej, without its costing ever so much. I daer
sae I can't get wun at all; for moest peepl cum in thaer oen, and
it's a long wae to th staebl, and no wun to send."</p>

<p>"I'll go."</p>

<p>"No, indeed! It's past nien, and dark as Egypt. I can't stop
heer, for th hous is fuul. Sallie has sum gurls staeing with her.
I'll rest till Hannah cums, and then do th best I can."</p>

<p>"I'll ask Laurie; he wil go," sed Jo, luuking releevd as th iedeea
ocurd to her.</p>

<p>"Mursy, no! Don't ask or tel any wun. Get me mi rubers,

<p>"Thae ar going out to super now. I'll stae with U; I'd
rather."</p>

<p>"No, deer, run along, and bring me sum cofy. I'm so tierd,
I can't stur!"</p>

<p>So Meg recliend, with rubers wel hiden, and Jo went blundering
away to th diening-room, which she found after going into a
china-clozet, and oepening th dor of a room whaer 
<ins title="Add period to Mr Gardiner."> 
oeld Mr. Gardiner</ins>
wuz taeking a litl private refreshment. Maeking a dart at th taebl,
she secuerd th cofy, which she imeediatly spilt, thaerbi maeking
th frunt of her dres as bad as th bak.</p>

<p>"O, deer, whut a blunderbuss I am!" exclaemd Jo, finishing
Meg's gluv by scrubing her goun with it.</p>

<p>"Can I help U?" sed a frendly vois; and thaer wuz Laurie,
with a fuul cup in wun hand and a plaet of iess in th uther.</p>

<p>"I wuz trieing to get sumthing for Meg, hoo is verry tierd, and
sum wun shuuk me; and heer I am, in a niess staet," anserd
Jo, glansing dizmaly from th staend scurt to th cofy-culord
gluv.</p>

<p>"Too bad! I wuz luuking for sum wun to giv this to. Mae I
taek it to yuur sister?"</p>

<p>"O, thank U! I'll sho U whaer she is. I don't ofer to
taek it mieself, for I should oenly get into anuther scraep if I did."</p>

<p>Jo led th wae; and, as if uezd to waeting on laedys, Laurie droo
up a litl taebl, brought a second instalment of cofy and iess for Jo,
and wuz so obliejing that eeven particular Meg pronounced him a "niess
boy." Thae had a merry tiem oever th bonbons and motoes, and
wer in th midst of a qieet gaem of "Buz," with too or three uther
yung peepl hoo had straed in, when Hannah apeerd. Meg
forgot her fuut, and roez so qikly that she wuz forst to cach hoeld
of Jo, with an exclamation of paen.</p>

<p>"Hush! Don't sae anything," she whisperd, ading aloud,
"It's nuthing. I turnd mi fuut a litl, that's all"; and limpt
up-staers to put her things on.</p>

<p>Hannah scoelded, Meg cried, and Jo wuz at her wits' end, till she
<span class="pagenum2">41</span>
desieded to taek things into her oen hands. Sliping out, she ran
doun, and, fiending a survant, askt if he cuud get her a carrej. It
happened to be a hierd waeter, hoo knew nuthing about th naeborhuud;
and Jo wuz luuking round for help, when Laurie, hoo had
hurd whut she sed, caem up, and oferd his grandfaather's carrej,
which had just cum for him, he sed.</p>

<p>"It's so eerly! U can't meen to go yet?" began Jo, luuking
releevd, but hezitaeting to accept th ofer.</p>

<p>"I aulwaes go eerly,—I do, truly! Pleez let me taek U hoem?
It's all on mi wae, U noe, and it raens, thae sae."</p>

<p>That setld it; and, teling him of Meg's mis-hap, Jo graetfuly
accepted, and rusht up to bring doun th rest of th party. Hannah
haeted raen as much as a cat duz; so she maed no trubl, and
thae roeld away in th lugzhuurius cloez carrej, feeling verry festiv
and elegant. 
<ins title="Replace semicolon after box with a comma."> 
Laurie went on th box,</ins> so Meg cuud keep her fuut
up, and th gurls taukt oever thaer party in freedom.</p>

<p>"I had a capital tiem. Did U?" askt Jo, rumpling up her
haer, and maeking herself comfortable.</p>

<p>"Yes, till I hurt mieself. Sallie's frend, Annie Moffat, tuuk a fansy
to me, and askt me to cum and spend a week with her, when Sallie
duz. She is going in th spring, when th opera cums; and it wil
be perfectly splendid, if muther oenly lets me go," anserd Meg,
cheering up at th thaut.</p>

<p>"I saw U dansing with th red-heded man I ran away from.
Wuz he niess?"</p>

<p>"O, verry! His haer is auburn, not red; and he wuz verry poliet,
and I had a delicious redowa with him."</p>

<p>"He luukt liek a gras-hoper in a fit, when he did th nue step.
Laurie and I couldn't help lafing. Did U heer us?"</p>

<p>"No; but it wuz verry rood. Whut <em>wer</em> U about all that tiem,
hiden away thaer?"</p>

<p>Jo toeld her advenchers, and, by th tiem she had finisht, thae wer
at hoem. With meny thanks, thae sed "Guud niet," and crept in,
hoeping to disturb no wun; but th instant thaer dor creekt, too
litl niet-caps bobd up, and too sleepy but eeger voises cried
out,—</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">42</span>
"Tel about th party! tel about th party!"</p>

<p>With whut Meg called "a graet wont of maners," Jo had saevd
sum bonbons for th litl gurls; and thae soon subsided, after heering
th moest thriling events of th evening.</p>

<p>"I declaer, it reealy seems liek being a fien yung laedy, to cum
hoem from th party in a carrej, and sit in mi dresing-goun, with
a maed to waet on me," sed Meg, as Jo bound up her fuut with
arnica, and brushed her haer.</p>

<p>"I don't beleev fien yung laedys enjoy themselvs a bit mor
than we do, in spiet of our burnt haer, oeld gouns, wun gluv apeess,
and tight slipers that spraen our ankls when we ar sily enough to
waer them." And I think Jo wuz qiet riet.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smc">O</span> deer, how hard it duz seem to taek up our 
paks and go on," sighed Meg, th morning after th party; for, now th 
holidaes wer oever, th week of merry-maeking did not fit her for going on 
eezily with th task she never liked.</p>

<p>
"I wish it wuz Christmas or Nue-Yeer all th tiem; wouldn't it
be fun?" anserd Jo, yauning dizmaly.</p>

<p>
"We shouldn't enjoy ourselvs haf so much as we do now. But
it duz seem so niess to hav litl supers and bouquets, and go to
partys, and driev hoem, and red and rest, and not wurk. It's liek
<span class="pagenum2">44</span>
uther peepl, U noe, and I aulwaes envy gurls hoo do such things;
I'm so fond of lukshery," sed Meg, trieing to desied which of too
shaby gouns wuz th leest shaby.</p>

<p>
"Wel, we can't hav it, so don't let us grumbl, but shoulder our
bundles and truj along as cheerfuly as Marmee duz. I'm shuur
Ant March is a reguelar Oeld Man of th See to me, but I supoez
when I've lurnd to carry her without complaening, she wil tumbl
off, or get so liet that I sha'n't miend her."</p>

<p>
This iedeea tikld Jo's fansy, and put her in guud spirits; but Meg
didn't brieten, for her burden, consisting of foer spoilt children,
seemd hevyer than ever. She hadn't hart enough eeven to maek
herself prity, as uezhual, by putting on a bloo nek-ribon, and dresing
her haer in th moest becuming wae.</p>

<p>"Whaer's th uez of luuking niess, when no wun sees me but thoes
cros mijets, and no wun caers whether I'm prity or not?" she
muterd, shutting her drawer with a jurk. "I shal hav to toil and
moil all mi daes, with oenly litl bits of fun now and then, and get
oeld and ugly and sour, because I'm puur, and can't enjoy mi lief as
uther gurls do. It's a shaem!"</p>

<p>So Meg went doun, waering an injerd luuk, and wasn't at all
agreeabl at brekfast-tiem. Every wun seemd rather out of sorts,
and inclined to croek. Beth had a hedaek, and lae on th soefa,
trieing to cumfort herself with th cat and three kitens; Amy wuz
freting because her lesons wer not lurnd, and she couldn't fiend
her rubers; Jo <em>wuud</em> whisl and maek a graet raket geting
redy; Mrs. March wuz verry busy trieing to finish a leter, which
must go at wunss; and Hannah had th grumps, for being up laet
didn't suit her.</p>

<p>"Thaer never <em>wuz</em> such a cros family!" cried Jo, loozing her
temper when she had upset an inkstand, broeken boeth boot-lacings,
and sat doun upon her hat.</p>

<p>"U're th crossest purson in it!" returnd Amy, woshing out
th sum, that wuz all rong, with th teers that had faulen on her
slate.</p>

<p>"Beth, if U don't keep thees horrid cats doun selar I'll hav
them dround," exclaemd Meg anggrily, as she tried to get rid of
<span class="pagenum2">45</span>
th kiten, which had scrambld up her bak, and stuk liek a burr
just out of reech.</p>

<p>Jo laft, Meg scoelded, Beth implord, and Amy waeld, because
she couldn't remember how much nien times twelve wuz.</p>

<p>"Gurls, gurls, do be qieet wun mienuet! I <em>must</em> get this off by th
eerly mael, and U driev me distracted with yuur wury," cried Mrs.
March, crosing out th thurd spoilt sentenss in her leter.</p>

<p>Thaer wuz a moementaery lul, broeken by Hannah, hoo staukt in,
laed too hot turn-overs on th taebl, and staukt out again. Thees
turn-overs wer an institooshon; and th gurls called them "mufs,"
for thae had no others, and found th hot pies verry cumforting to
thaer hands on coeld mornings. Hannah never forgot to maek them,
no mater how busy or grumpy she miet be, for th wauk wuz long
and bleek; th puur things got no uther lunch, and wer seldom
hoem befor too.</p>

<p>"Cudl yuur cats, and get oever yuur hedaek, Bethy. Guud-by,
Marmee; we ar a set of rascals this morning, but we'll cum hoem
reguelar aenjels. Now then, Meg!" and Jo trampt away, feeling that
th pilgrims wer not setting out as thae aut to do.</p>

<p>Thae aulwaes luukt bak befor turning th corner, for thaer
muther wuz aulwaes at th windo, to nod and smiel, and waev her
hand to them. Sumhow it seemd as if thae couldn't hav got
thru th dae without that; for, whotever thaer mood miet be,
th last glimps of that mutherly faess wuz shuur to affect them liek
sunshine.</p>

<p>"If Marmee shuuk her fist insted of kissing her hand to us, it
wuud surv us riet, for mor ungraetful reches than we ar wer
never seen," cried Jo, taeking a remorsful satisfakshon in th snoey
wauk and biter wiend.</p>

<p>"Don't uez such dredful expreshons," sed Meg, from th depths
of th vael in which she had shrouded herself liek a nun sik of th
wurld.</p>

<p>"I liek guud strong wurds, that meen sumthing," replied Jo,
caching her hat as it tuuk a leep off her hed, preparatory to flieing
away aultogether.</p>

<p>"Call yuurself any naems U liek; but <em>I</em> 
am neether a rascal nor a rech, and I don't chooz to be called so."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">46</span>
"U're a blieted being, and decidedly cros to-dae because
U can't sit in th lap of lukshery all th tiem. Puur deer, just waet
till I maek mi forchun, and U shal revel in carrejs and iess-creem
and hie-heeld slipers and posies and red-heded boys to danss
with."</p>

<p>"How ridicuelus U ar, Jo!" but Meg laft at th nonsenss,
and felt beter in spiet of herself.</p>

<p>"Luky for U I am; for if I put on crusht aers, and tried to be
dizmal, as U do, we should be in a niess staet. Thank guudnes,
I can aulwaes fiend sumthing funy to keep me up. Don't croek any
mor, but cum hoem joly, thaer's a deer."</p>

<p>Jo gaev her sister an encurejing pat on th shoulder as thae
parted for th dae, eech going a diferent wae, eech huging her
litl worm turn-oever, and eech trieing to be cheerful in spiet of wintry
wether, hard wurk, and th unsatisfied deziers of plezher-luving
yooth.</p>

<p>When Mr. March lost his property in trieing to help an unforchunat
frend, th too oeldest gurls begd to be alowd to do sumthing
tord thaer oen suport, at leest. Beleeving that thae cuud not
begin too eerly to cultivaet enerjy, industry, and independenss, thaer
paerents consented, and boeth fel to wurk with th harty guud-wil
which in spiet of all obstakls, is shuur to succeed at last. Margaret
found a plaess as nursery guvernes, and felt rich with her small salary.
As she sed, she <em>wuz</em> "fond of lukshery," and her cheef trubl wuz
poverty. She found it harder to baer than th others, because she
cuud remember a tiem when hoem wuz buetiful, lief fuul of eez and
plezher, and wont of any kiend unnoen. She tried not to be envious
or discontented, but it wuz verry nacheral that th yung gurl should
long for prity things, gae frends, accomplishments, and a hapy lief.
At th Kings' she daily saw all she wontedw, for th children's oelder
sisters wer just out, and Meg caut freeqent glimpses of dainty
baul-dreses and bouquets, hurd lievly gosip about theeaters, conserts,
sleighing partys, and merry-maekings of all kiends, and saw muny lavisht
on trifles which wuud hav been so precious to her. Puur
Meg seldom complaend, but a senss of injustis maed her feel
biter tord every wun sumtiems, for she had not yet lurnd
<span class="pagenum2">47</span>
to noe how rich she wuz in th blessings which aloen can maek
lief hapy.</p>

<p>Jo happened to suit Ant March, hoo wuz laem, and needed an
aktiv purson to waet upon her. Th chieldles oeld laedy had oferd
to adopt wun of th gurls when th trubls caem, and wuz much
ofended because her ofer wuz decliend. Uther frends toeld th
Marches that thae had lost all chanss of being rememberd in th rich
oeld laedy's wil; but th unwurldly Marches oenly sed,—</p>

<p>"We can't giv up our gurls for a duzen forchuns. Rich or puur,
we wil keep together and be hapy in wun anuther."</p>

<p>Th oeld laedy wouldn't speek to them for a tiem, but hapening
to meet Jo at a frend's, sumthing in her comikal faess and blunt
maners struk th oeld laedy's fansy, and she propoezd to taek her
for a companyon. This did not suit Jo at all; but she accepted th
plaess sinss nuthing beter apeerd, and, to every wun's serpriez,
got on remarkably wel with her irasibl relativ. Thaer wuz an
ocaezhonal tempest, and wunss Jo had marcht hoem, declaering she
couldn't baer it any longer; but Ant March aulwaes cleerd up
qikly, and sent for her bak again with such urjensy that she cuud
not refuez, for in her hart she rather liked th pepery oeld laedy.</p>

<p>I suspekt that th reeal atrakshon wuz a larj liebraery of fien books,
which wuz left to dust and spieders sinss Unkl March died. Jo
rememberd th kiend oeld jentlman, hoo uezd to let her build raelroeds
and bridges with his big dikshonaerys, tel her storys about th
qeer pikchers in his Latin books, and bie her cards of jinjerbred
whenever he met her in th street. Th dim, dusty room, with th
busts staering doun from th taul book-caeses, th cosy chaers, th
gloebs, and, best of all, th wildernes of books, in which she cuud
waander whaer she liked, maed th liebraery a reejon of bliss to her.
Th moement Ant March tuuk her nap, or wuz busy with company,
Jo huryd to this qieet plaess, and, curling herself up in th eezy-chaer,
devourd poetry, roemanss, history, travels, and pikchers, liek a reguelar
book-wurm. But, liek all hapynes, it did not last long; for as shuur
as she had just reached th hart of th story, th sweetest vurss of
th song, or th moest perilous advencher of her traveller, a shril
vois called, "Josy-phine! Josy-phine!" and she had to leev her
<span class="pagenum2">48</span>
paradise to wiend yarn, wosh th poodel, or red Belsham's Essays by

<p>Jo's ambishon wuz to do sumthing verry splendid; whut it wuz she
had no iedeea, as yet, but left it for tiem to tel her; and, meenwhiel, found
her graetest aflikshon in th fakt that she couldn't red, run, and
ried as much as she liked. A qik temper, sharp tung, and restles
spirit wer aulwaes geting her into scraeps, and her lief wuz a
seerys of ups and douns, which wer boeth comik and pathetik. But
th traening she reseevd at Ant March's wuz just whut she needed;
and th thaut that she wuz dooing sumthing to suport herself
maed her hapy, in spiet of th perpechual "Josy-phine!"</p>

<p>Beth wuz too bashful to go to scool; it had been tried, but she
suferd so much that it wuz given up, and she did her lesons at
<span class="pagenum2">49</span>
hoem, with her faather. Eeven when he went away, and her muther
wuz called to devoet her skil and enerjy to Soeljers' Aed Soesieetys,
Beth went faethfuly on by herself, and did th best she cuud. She
wuz a housewifely litl creecher, and helpt Hannah keep hoem
neet and comfortable for th wurkers, never thinking of any reword
but to be luvd. Long, qieet daes she spent, not loenly nor iedl, for
her litl wurld wuz peepld with imajinarry frends, and she wuz by
naechuur a busy bee. Thaer wer six dols to be taeken up and drest
every morning, for Beth wuz a chield still, and luvd her pets as wel
as ever. Not wun hoel or handsum wun amung them; all wer outcasts
till Beth tuuk them in; for, when her sisters outgroo thees iedols,
thae past to her, because Amy wuud hav nuthing oeld or ugly.
Beth cherrisht them all th mor tenderly for that verry reezon, and
set up a hospital for infurm dols. No pins wer ever stuk into thaer
coton vietals; no harsh wurds or bloes wer ever given them; no
neglekt ever saddened th hart of th moest repulsiv: but all wer
fed and cloethd, nurst and caressed, with an affection which never
faeld. Wun forlorn fragment of <em>dollanity</em> had belongd to Jo; and,
having led a tempestuous lief, wuz left a rek in th rag-bag, from
which dreery poorhouse it wuz rescued by Beth, and taeken to her
refuej. Having no top to its hed, she tied on a neet litl cap, and,
as boeth arms and legs wer gon, she hid thees defishensys by foelding
it in a blanket, and devoeting her best bed to this cronik invalid. If
any wun had noen th caer lavisht on that doly, I think it wuud
hav tucht thaer harts, eeven whiel thae laft. She brought it
bits of bouquets; she red to it, tuuk it out to breeth th aer, hiden
under her coet; she sung it lullabys, and never went to bed without
kissing its durty faess, and whispering tenderly, "I hoep U'll hav a
guud niet, mi puur deer."</p>

<p>Beth had her trubls as wel as th others; and not being an
aenjel, but a verry hueman litl gurl, she ofen "wept a litl weep," as
Jo sed, because she couldn't taek muezik lesons and hav a fien
piano. She luvd muezik so deerly, tried so hard to lurn, and practised
away so paeshently at th jingling oeld instrument, that it did seem
as if sum wun (not to hint Ant March) aut to help her. Noebody
did, however, and noebody saw Beth wiep th teers off th yelo
<span class="pagenum2">50</span>
kees, that wouldn't keep in tuen, when she wuz all aloen. She sang
liek a litl lark about her wurk, never wuz too tierd to plae for Marmee
and th gurls, and dae after dae sed hoepfuly to herself, "I noe I'll
get mi muezik sum tiem, if I'm guud."</p>

<p>Thaer ar meny Beths in th wurld, shi and qieet, sitting in corners
till needed, and living for others so cheerfuly that no wun sees
th sacrifieses till th litl criket on th harth stops churping, and
th sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leeving silence and shado
behind.</p>

<p>If anybody had askt Amy whut th graetest trieal of her lief wuz,
she wuud hav anserd at wunss, "Mi noez." When she wuz a
baeby, Jo had accidentally dropt her into th coel-hod, and Amy
insisted that th faul had rooind her noez forever. It wuz not big,
nor red, liek puur "Petrea's"; it wuz oenly rather flat, and all th
pinching in th wurld cuud not giv it an aristocratic pointer. No wun
miended it but herself, and it wuz dooing its best to gro, but Amy felt
deeply th wont of a Grecian noez, and droo hoel sheets of handsum
wuns to consoel herself.</p>

<p>"Litl Raphael," as her sisters called her, had a desieded talent
for drawing, and wuz never so hapy as when copying flowers, deziening
faerys, or ilustraeting storys with qeer specimens of art. Her
teechers complaend that, insted of dooing her sums, she cuverd her
slate with animals; th blank paejes of her atlas wer uezd to copy
maps on; and caricatures of th moest loodicrus descripshon caem
fluttering out of all her books at unluky moements. She got thru
her lesons as wel as she cuud, and manejd to escaep reprimands
by being a model of deportment. She wuz a graet faevorit with her
maets, being guud-temperd, and possessing th hapy art of pleezing
without efort. Her litl aers and graeses wer much admierd, so
wer her accomplishments; for besied her drawing, she cuud plae
twelve tuens, croeshae, and red French without mispronounsing mor
than too thurds of th wurds. She had a plaentiv wae of saeing,
"When papa wuz rich we did so-and-so," which wuz verry tuching;
and her long wurds wer considerd "perfectly elegant" by th
gurls.</p>

<p>Amy wuz in a faer wae to be spoilt; for every wun peted her, and
<span class="pagenum2">51</span>
her small vanitys and selfishnesses wer groeing niesly. Wun thing,
however, rather qencht th vanitys; she had to waer her cuzin's
cloeths. Now Florence's maama hadn't a partikl of taest, and
Amy suferd deeply at having to waer a red insted of a bloo bonnet,
unbecuming gouns, and fusy aprons that did not fit. Everything
wuz guud, wel maed, and litl worn; but Amy's artistik ies wer
much aflikted, especially this winter, when her scool dres wuz a
dul purpl, with yelo dots, and no trimming.</p>

<p>"Mi oenly cumfort," she sed to Meg, with teers in her ies, "is,
that muther don't taek tuks in mi dreses whenever I'm nauty, as
Maria Parks' muther duz. Mi deer, it's reealy dredful; for sumtiems
she is so bad, her frok is up to her nees, and she can't cum
to scool. When I think of this <em>deggerredation</em>, I feel that I can baer
eeven mi flat noez and purpl goun, with yelo ski-rokets on it."</p>

<p>Meg wuz Amy's confidant and monitor, and, by sum straenj
atrakshon of opozits, Jo wuz jentl Beth's. To Jo aloen did th
shi chield tel her thoughts; and oever her big, harum-scarum sister,
Beth unconshusly exercised mor inflooenss than any wun in th
family. Th too oelder gurls wer a graet deel to wun anuther, but
eech tuuk wun of th yungger into her keeping, and wocht oever
her in her oen wae; "plaeing muther" thae called it, and put thaer
sisters in th plaeses of discarded dols, with th maturnal instinkt of
litl wimen.</p>

<p>"Has anybody got anything to tel? It's been such a dizmal dae
I'm reealy dieing for sum amuezment," sed Meg, as thae sat soeing
together that evening.</p>

<p>"I had a qeer tiem with ant to-dae, and, as I got th best of it,
I'll tel U about it," began Jo, hoo deerly luvd to tel storys.
"I wuz reeding that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I
aulwaes do, for ant soon drops off, and then I taek out sum niess
book, and red liek fuery till she waeks up. I akchualy maed mieself
sleepy; and, befor she began to nod, I gaev such a gaep that she
askt me whut I ment by oepening mi mouth wied enough to taek
th hoel book in at wunss.</p>

</div>

<p>"'I wish I cuud, and be dun with it,' sed I, trieing not to be
sausy.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">52</span>
"Then she gaev me a long lecture on mi sins, and toeld me to sit
and think them oever whiel she just 'lost' herself for a moement. She
never fiends herself verry soon; so th mienuet her cap began to bob,
liek a top-hevy dahlia, I whipt th 'Viker of Wakefield' out of
mi poket, and red away, with wun ie on him, and wun on ant.
I'd just got to whaer thae all tumbld into th wauter, when I forgot,
and laft out loud. Ant woek up; and, being mor guud-naecherd
after her nap, toeld me to red a bit, and sho whut frivolus wurk I
prefurd to th wurthy and instruktiv Belsham. I did mi verry best,
and she liked it, tho she oenly sed,—</p>

<p>"'I don't understand whut it's all about. Go bak and begin it,
chield.'</p>

<p>"Bak I went, and maed th Primroezes as interesting as ever I
cuud. Wunss I wuz wiked enough to stop in a thriling plaess, and
sae meekly, 'I'm afraed it tires U, maa'am; sha'n't I stop now?'</p>

<p>"She caut up her niting, which had dropt out of her hands,
gaev me a sharp luuk thru her specs, and sed, in her short
wae,—</p>

<p>"'Finish th chapter, and don't be impurtinent, mis.'"</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">53</span>
"Did she oen she liked it?" askt Meg.</p>

<p>"O, bles U, no! but she let oeld Belsham rest; and, when I
ran bak after mi gluvs this afternoon, thaer she wuz, so hard at th
Viker that she didn't heer me laf as I danst a jig in th haul,
because of th guud tiem cuming. Whut a plezant lief she miet
hav, if she oenly choez. I don't envy her much, in spiet of her
muny, for after all rich peepl hav about as meny wurys as puur
wuns, I think," aded Jo.</p>

<p>"That remiends me," sed Meg, "that I've got sumthing to tel.
It isn't funy, liek Jo's story, but I thaut about it a guud deel
as I caem hoem. At th Kings to-dae I found everybody in a flury,
and wun of th children sed that her oeldest bruther had dun sumthing
dredful, and papa had sent him away. I hurd Mrs. King
crieing and Mr. King tauking verry loud, and Graess and Ellen turnd
away thaer faeses when thae past me, so I shouldn't see how red
thaer ies wer. I didn't ask any qeschons, of corss; but I felt so
sorry for them, and wuz rather glad I hadn't any wield bruthers to do
wiked things and disgraess th family."</p>

<p>"I think being disgraest in scool is a graet deel tri<em>inger</em> than
anything bad boys can do," sed Amy, shaeking her hed, as if her
expeeri’enss of lief had been a deep wun. "Susie Perkins caem to
scool to-dae with a luvly red carnelian ring; I wontedw it dredfuly,
and wisht I wuz her with all mi miet. Wel, she droo a pikcher
of Mr. Davis, with a monstrus noez and a hump, and th wurds,
'Yung laedys, mi ie is upon U!' cuming out of his mouth in a
balloon thing. We wer lafing oever it, when all of a suden his
ie <em>wuz</em> on us, and he orderd Susie to bring up her slate. She wuz
<em>parry</em>lized with friet, but she went, and o, whut <em>do</em> U think he
did? He tuuk her by th eer, th eer! just fansy how horrid!—and
led her to th resitaeshon platform, and maed her stand thaer haf
an our, hoelding that slate so every wun cuud see."</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>"Didn't th gurls laf at th pikcher?" askt Jo, hoo relisht th
scraep.</p>

<p>"Laf? Not wun! Thae sat as still as miess; and Susie cried
qorts, I noe she did. I didn't envy her then; for I felt that milyons
of carnelian rings wouldn't hav maed me hapy, after that. I
<span class="pagenum2">54</span>
never, never should hav got oever such a agonizing mortificaeshon."
And Amy went on with her wurk, in th proud conshusnes of vurchoo,
and th successful uteranss of too long wurds in a breth.</p>

<p>"I saw sumthing that I liked this morning, and I ment to tel it
at diner, but I forgot," sed Beth, putting Jo's topsy-turvy basket in
order as she taukt. "When I went to get sum oisters for Hannah,
Mr. Laurence wuz in th fish-shop; but he didn't see me, for I kept
behind a barrel, and he wuz busy with Mr. Cuter, th fish-man. A
puur wuuman caem in, with a pael and a mop, and askt Mr. Cuter if
he wuud let her do sum scrubing for a bit of fish, because she
hadn't any diner for her children, and had been disapointed of a
dae's wurk. Mr. Cuter wuz in a hurry, and sed 'No,' rather crosly;
so she wuz going away, luuking hunggry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence
huukt up a big fish with th cruuked end of his caen, and held it
out to her. She wuz so glad and serpriezd, she tuuk it riet in her
arms, and thankt him oever and oever. He toeld her to 'go along and
<span class="pagenum2">55</span>
cuuk it,' and she huryd off, so hapy! Wasn't it guud of him?
O, she did luuk so funy, huging th big, slippery fish, and hoeping
Mr. Laurence's bed in heven wuud be 'aisy.'"</p>

</div>

<p>When thae had laft at Beth's story, thae askt thaer muther for
wun; and, after a moement's thaut, she sed soeberly,—</p>

<p>"As I sat cuting out bloo flanel jakets to-dae, at th rooms, I
felt verry anxious about faather, and thaut how loenly and helples we
should be, if anything happened to him. It wuz not a wiez thing to
do; but I kept on wurying, till an oeld man caem in, with an order
for sum cloeths. He sat doun neer me, and I began to tauk to him;
for he luukt puur and tierd and anxious.</p>

<p>"'Hav U suns in th army?' I askt; for th noet he brought
wuz not to me.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">56</span>
"'Yes, maa'am. I had foer, but too wer kild, wun is a prizoner,
and I'm going to th uther, hoo is verry sik in a Washington hospital,'
he anserd qieetly.</p>

<p>"'U hav dun a graet deel for yuur cuntry, sur,' I sed, feeling
respekt now, insted of pity.</p>

<p>"'Not a miet mor than I aut, maa'am. I'd go mieself, if I wuz
any uez; as I ain't, I giv mi boys, and giv 'em free.'</p>

<p>"He spoek so cheerfuly, luukt so sincere, and seemd so glad to
giv his all, that I wuz ashamed of mieself. I'd given wun man, and
thaut it too much, whiel he gaev foer, without grujing them. I
had all mi gurls to cumfort me at hoem; and his last sun wuz waeting,
miels away, to sae 'guud by' to him, perhaps! I felt so rich, so
hapy, thinking of mi blessings, that I maed him a niess bundle, gaev
him sum muny, and thankt him hartily for th leson he had
taut me."</p>

<p>"Tel anuther story, muther,—wun with a moral to it, liek this. I
liek to think about them afterwards, if thae ar reeal, and not too
preechy," sed Jo, after a mienuet's silence.</p>

<p>Mrs. March smield, and began at wunss; for she had toeld storys to
this litl audi’enss for meny yeers, and knew how to pleez them.</p>

<p>"Wunss upon a tiem, thaer wer foer gurls, hoo had enough to eat
and drink and waer, a guud meny cumforts and plezhers, kiend frends
and paerents, hoo luvd them deerly, and yet thae wer not contented."
(Heer th liseners stoel sli luuks at wun anuther, and began to soe
dilijently.) "Thees gurls wer anxious to be guud, and maed meny
exselent rezolooshons; but thae did not keep them verry wel, and wer
constantly saeing, 'If we oenly had this,' or 'If we cuud oenly do that,'
qiet forgeting how much thae aulredy had, and how meny plezant
things thae akchualy cuud do. So thae askt an oeld wuuman whut
spel thae cuud uez to maek them hapy, and she sed, 'When U
feel discontented, think oever yuur blessings, and be graetful.'" (Heer
Jo luukt up qikly, as if about to speek, but chaenjd her miend,
seeing that th story wuz not dun yet.)</p>

<p>"Being sensibl gurls, thae desieded to tri her advice, and soon wer
serpriezd to see how wel off thae wer. Wun discuverd that muny
couldn't keep shaem and sorro out of rich peepl's houses; anuther
<span class="pagenum2">57</span>
that, tho she wuz puur, she wuz a graet deel hapyer, with her yooth,
helth, and guud spirits, than a surten fretful, feebl oeld laedy, hoo
couldn't enjoy her cumforts; a thurd that, disagreeabl as it wuz to
help get diner, it wuz harder still to hav to go beging for it; and th
foerth, that eeven carnelian rings wer not so valueable as guud behaevyor.
So thae agreed to stop complaening, to enjoy th blessings aulredy
possessed, and tri to dezurv them, lest thae should be taeken away
entierly, insted of increest; and I beleev thae wer never disapointed,
or sorry that thae tuuk th oeld wuuman's advice."</p>

<p>"Now, Marmee, that is verry cuning of U to turn our oen storys
against us, and giv us a surmon insted of a roemanss!" cried Meg.</p>

<p>"I liek that kiend of surmon. It's th sort faather uezd to tel us,"
sed Beth thautfuly, putting th needls straet on Jo's cuushon.</p>

<p>"I don't complaen neer as much as th others do, and I shal be
mor careful than ever now; for I've had worning from Susie's dounfaul,"
sed Amy moraly.</p>

<p>"We needed that leson, and we wun't forget it. If we do, U
just sae to us, as oeld Chloe did in 'Unkl Tom,' 'Tink ob yer marcies,
chillen! tink ob yer marcies!'" aded Jo, hoo cuud not, for
th lief of her, help geting a morsel of fun out of th litl surmon,
tho she tuuk it to hart as much as any of them.</p>

<span class="smc">"Whut</span> in th wurld ar U going to do
now, Jo?" askt Meg, wun snoey afternoon,
as her sister caem tramping
thru th haul, in ruber boots, oeld
sak and huud, with a broom in wun
hand and a shuvel in th uther.</p>

<p>"Going out for exercise," anserd
Jo, with a mischivus twinkle in her
ies.</p>

<p>"I should think too long wauks this
morning wuud hav been enough!
It's coeld and dul out; and I advise
U to stae, worm and dri, by th fier,
as I do," sed Meg, with a shiver.</p>

<p>"Never taek advice! Can't keep
still all dae, and, not being a puusycat,
I don't liek to doez by th fier.
I liek advenchers, and I'm going to
fiend sum."</p>

<p>Meg went bak to toest her feet and red "Ivanhoe"; and Jo
began to dig paths with graet enerjy. Th sno wuz liet, and with
her broom she soon swept a path all round th garden, for Beth to
wauk in when th sun caem out; and th invalid dols needed aer.
Now, th garden separaeted th Marches' hous from that of Mr. Laurence.
Boeth stuud in a suburb of th sity, which wuz still cuntry-liek,
with groevs and launs, larj gardens, and qieet streets. A loe
<span class="pagenum2">59</span>
hej parted th too estates. On wun sied wuz an oeld, broun hous,
luuking rather baer and shaby, robd of th viens that in sumer
cuverd its wauls, and th flowers which then serounded it. On th
uther sied wuz a stately stoen manshon, plainly betokening every sort
of cumfort and lukshery, from th big coech-hous and wel-kept grounds
to th conservatory and th glimpses of luvly things wun caut
between th rich curtens. Yet it seemd a loenly, liefles sort of
hous; for no children frolikt on th laun, no mutherly faess ever
smield at th windoes, and fue peepl went in and out, exsept th
oeld jentlman and his grandson.</p>

<p>To Jo's lievly fansy, this fien hous seemd a kiend of enchanted
palis, fuul of splendors and deliets, which no wun enjoyd. She
had long wontedw to behoeld thees hiden glorys, and to noe th
"Laurence boy," hoo luukt as if he wuud liek to be noen, if he
oenly knew how to begin. Sinss th party, she had been mor eeger
than ever, and had pland meny waes of maeking frends with him;
but he had not been seen laetly, and Jo began to think he had gon
away, when she wun dae spied a broun faess at an uper windo, luuking
wistfuly doun into thaer garden, whaer Beth and Amy wer sno-balling
wun anuther.</p>

<p>"That boy is sufering for soesieety and fun," she sed to herself.
"His grandpa duz not noe whut's guud for him, and keeps him
shut up all aloen. He needs a party of joly boys to plae with, or
sumbody yung and lievly. I've a graet miend to go oever and tel
th oeld jentlman so!"</p>

<p>Th iedeea amuezd Jo, hoo liked to do daring things, and wuz
aulwaes scandalizing Meg by her qeer performances. Th plan of
"going oever" wuz not forgoten; and when th snoey afternoon
caem, Jo rezolvd to tri whut cuud be dun. She saw Mr. Laurence
driev off, and then sallied out to dig her wae doun to th hej,
whaer she paused, and tuuk a survae. All qieet,—curtens doun at
th loeer windoes; survants out of siet, and nuthing hueman vizibl
but a curly blak hed leening on a thin hand at th uper
windo.</p>

<p>"Thaer he is," thaut Jo, "puur boy! all aloen and sik this
dizmal dae. It's a shaem! I'll tos up a sno-baul, and maek him
<span class="pagenum2">60</span>
luuk out, and then sae a kiend wurd to

<p>Up went a handfuul of soft sno,
and th hed turnd at wunss, shoeing
a faess which lost its listles luuk in
a mienuet, as th big ies brietend
and th mouth began to
smiel. Jo noded and laft,
and flurisht her broom as she
called out,—</p>

<p>Laurie oepend th windo,
and croekt out as horsly as
a raeven,—</p>

<p>"Beter, thank U. I've
had a bad coeld, and been shut
up a week."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. Whut do U

<p>"Nuthing; it's as dul as

<p>"Don't U red?"</p>

<p>"Not much; thae wun't let

<p>"Can't sumbody red

<p>"Grandpa duz,

<p>"Hav sum wun

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">61</span>
"Thaer isn't any wun I'd liek to see. Boys maek such a row (noun),
and mi hed is week."</p>

<p>"Isn't thaer sum niess gurl hoo'd red and amuez U? Gurls ar

<p>"Don't noe any."</p>

<p>"U noe us," began Jo, then laft, and stopt.</p>

<p>"So I do! Wil U cum, pleez?" cried Laurie.</p>

<p>"I'm not qieet and niess; but I'll cum, if muther wil let me.
I'll go ask her. Shut that windo, liek a guud boy, and waet till I
cum."</p>

<p>With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marcht into th hous,
wundering whut thae wuud all sae to her. Laurie wuz in a flutter
of exsietment at th iedeea of having company, and floo about
to get redy; for, as Mrs. March sed, he wuz "a litl jentlman,"
and did onor to th cuming guessed by brushing his curly pate, putting
on a fresh collar, and trieing to tidy up th room, which, in spiet of
haf a duzen survants, wuz anything but neet. Prezently thaer caem
a loud ring, then a desieded vois, asking for "Mr. Laurie," and a
serpriezd-luuking survant caem runing up to anounss a yung
laedy.</p>

<p>"All riet, sho her up, it's Mis Jo," sed Laurie, going to th
dor of his litl parlor to meet Jo, hoo apeerd, luuking roezy and
kiend and qiet at her eez, with a cuverd dish in wun hand and
Beth's three kitens in th uther.</p>

<p>"Heer I am, bag and bagej," she sed briskly. "Muther sent
her luv, and wuz glad if I cuud do anything for U. Meg wontedw
me to bring sum of her blanc-maenj; she maeks it verry niesly, and
Beth thaut her cats wuud be cumforting. I knew U'd laf at
them, but I couldn't refuez, she wuz so anxious to do sumthing."</p>

<p>It so happened that Beth's funy loen wuz just th thing; for, in
lafing oever th kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and groo soeshabl
at wunss.</p>

<p>"That luuks too prity to eat," he sed, smieling with plezher, as
Jo uncovered th dish, and shoed th blanc-maenj, serounded by
a garland of green leevs, and th scarlet flowers of Amy's pet
jeraenium.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">62</span>
"It isn't anything, oenly thae all felt kiendly, and wontedw to sho it.
Tel th gurl to put it away for yuur tee: it's so simpl, U can eat
it; and, being soft, it wil slip doun without hurting yuur sor throet.
Whut a cosy room this is!"</p>

<p>"It miet be if it wuz kept niess; but th maeds ar laezy, and I
don't noe how to maek them miend. It wurys me, tho."</p>

<p>"I'll riet it up in too minits; for it oenly needs to hav th
harth brushed, so,—and th things maed straet on th mantel-peess
so,—and th books put heer, and th botls thaer, and yuur
soefa turnd from th liet, and th piloes plumped up a bit. Now,
then, U're fixed."</p>

<p>And so he wuz; for, as she laft and taukt, Jo had whiskt
things into plaess, and given qiet a diferent aer to th room. Laurie
wocht her in respektful silence; and when she becond him to
his soefa, he sat doun with a sie of satisfakshon, saeing graetfuly,—</p>

<p>"How kiend U ar! Yes, that's whut it wontedw. Now pleez
taek th big chaer, and let me do sumthing to amuez mi company."</p>

<p>"No; I caem to amuez U. Shal I red aloud?" and Jo luukt
affectionately tord sum invieting books neer by.</p>

<p>"Thank U; I've red all thoes, and if U don't miend, I'd
rather tauk," anserd Laurie.</p>

<p>"Not a bit; I'll tauk all dae if U'll oenly set me going. Beth
sez I never noe when to stop."</p>

<p>"Is Beth th roezy wun, hoo staes at hoem a guud deel, and sumtiems
goes out with a litl basket?" askt Laurie, with interest.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's Beth; she's mi gurl, and a reguelar guud wun she is,
too."</p>

<p>"Th prity wun is Meg, and th curly-haired wun is Amy, I
beleev?"</p>

<p>"How did U fiend that out?"</p>

<p>Laurie culord up, but anserd frankly, "Whi, U see, I ofen
heer U calling to wun anuther, and when I'm aloen up heer, I can't
help luuking oever at yuur hous, U aulwaes seem to be having such
guud times. I beg yuur pardon for being so rood, but sumtiems
U forget to put doun th curten at th windo whaer th flowers
ar; and when th lamps ar lieted, it's liek luuking at a pikcher to
<!--<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;63]</span>-->
<span class="pagenum2">63</span>
see th fier, and U all round th taebl with yuur muther; her faess
is riet opozit, and it luuks so sweet behind th flowers, I can't
help woching it. I haeven't got any muther, U noe;" and
Laurie poekt th fier to hied a litl twitching of th lips that he
cuud not controel.</p>

<p>Th solitaery, hunggry luuk in his ies went straet to Jo's worm
hart. She had been so simply taut that thaer wuz no nonsenss in
her hed, and at fifteen she wuz as inosent and frank as any chield.
Laurie wuz sik and loenly; and, feeling how rich she wuz in hoem-luv
and hapynes, she gladly tried to shaer it with him. Her
faess wuz verry frendly and her sharp vois unuezhualy jentl as she
sed,—</p>

<p>"We'll never draw that curten any mor, and I giv U leev to
luuk as much as U liek. I just wish, tho, insted of peeping,
U'd cum oever and see us. Muther is so splendid, she'd do U
heeps of guud, and Beth wuud sing to U if <em>I</em> begd her to, and
Amy wuud danss; Meg and I wuud maek U laf oever our funy
staej propertys, and we'd hav joly times. Wouldn't yuur grandpa
let U?"</p>

<p>"I think he wuud, if yuur muther askt him. He's verry kiend,
tho he duz not luuk so; and he lets me do whut I liek, prity
much, oenly he's afraed I miet be a bother to straenjers," began
Laurie, brietening mor and mor.</p>

<p>"We ar not straenjers, we ar naebors, and U needn't think
U'd be a bother. We <em>wont</em> to noe U, and I've been trieing to
do it this ever so long. We haeven't been heer a graet whiel, U
noe, but we hav got aqaented with all our naebors but U."</p>

<p>"U see grandpa lievs amung his books, and doesn't miend much
whut happens outsied. Mr. Brooke, mi tuetor, doesn't stae heer, U
noe, and I hav no wun to go about with me, so I just stop at hoem
and get on as I can."</p>

<p>"That's bad. U aut to maek an efort, and go viziting everywhaer
U ar askt; then U'll hav plenty of frends, and plezant
plaeses to go to. Never miend being bashful; it wun't last long if U
keep going."</p>

<p>Laurie turnd red again, but wasn't ofended at being accused of
<span class="pagenum2">64</span>
bashfulness; for thaer wuz so much guud-wil in Jo, it wuz imposibl
not to taek her blunt speeches as kiendly as thae wer ment.</p>

<p>"Do U liek yuur scool?" askt th boy, chaenjing th subjekt,
after a litl pause, duuring which he staerd at th fier, and Jo luukt
about her, wel pleezd.</p>

<p>"Don't go to scool; I'm a business man—gurl, I meen. I go
to waet on mi graet-ant, and a deer, cros oeld soel she is, too,"
anserd Jo.</p>

<p>Laurie oepend his mouth to ask anuther qeschon; but remembering
just in tiem that it wasn't maners to maek too meny inqierys
into peepl's affairs, he shut it again, and luukt uncumfortabl. Jo
liked his guud breeding, and didn't miend having a laf at Ant
March, so she gaev him
a lievly descripshon of
th fijety oeld laedy, her
fat poodel, th parrot
that taukt Spanish, and
th liebraery whaer she
reveld. Laurie enjoyd
that imensly;
and when she toeld about
th prim oeld jentlman
hoo caem wunss to woo
Ant March, and, in th
midl of a fien speech,
how Poel had tweaked
his wig off to his graet
dismae, th boy lae
bak and laft till
th teers ran doun his
cheeks, and a maed
popt her hed in to
see whut wuz th mater.</p>

<p>"O! that duz me no end of guud. Tel on, pleez," he sed,
taeking his faess out of th soefa-cuushon, red and 
<ins title="Add period after merriment."> 
shiening with merriment.</ins></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">65</span>
Much elaeted with her success, Jo did "tel on," all about thaer
plaes and plans, thaer hoeps and feers for faather, and th moest interesting
events of th litl wurld in which th sisters livd. Then
thae got to tauking about books; and to Jo's deliet, she found that
Laurie luvd them as wel as she did, and had red eeven mor than
herself.</p>

<p>"If U liek them so much, cum doun and see ours. Grandpa
is out, so U needn't be afraed," sed Laurie, geting up.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraed of anything," returnd Jo, with a tos of th hed.</p>

<p>"I don't beleev U ar!" exclaemd th boy, luuking at her
with much admeraeshon, tho he privately thaut she wuud hav
guud reezon to be a trifle afraed of th oeld jentlman, if she met him
in sum of his moods.</p>

<p>Th atmosphere of th hoel hous being sumer-liek, Laurie led
th wae from room to room, leting Jo stop to examine whotever
struk her fansy; and so at last thae caem to th liebraery, whaer she
clapt her hands, and pranst, as she aulwaes did when especially
delieted. It wuz liend with books, and thaer wer pikchers and
stachoos, and distracting litl cabinets fuul of coins and cueriositys, and
sleepy-holo chaers, and qeer taebls, and bronzes; and, best of all,
a graet oepen fierplaess, with qaent tiels all round it.</p>

<p>"Whut richnes!" sighed Jo, sinking into th depth of a velvet
chaer, and gaezing about her with an aer of intenss satisfakshon.
"Theodore Laurence, U aut to be th hapyest boy in th wurld,"
she aded impresivly.</p>

<p>"A felo can't liv on books," sed Laurie, shaeking his hed, as
he purcht on a taebl opozit.</p>

<p>Befor he cuud sae mor, a bel rung, and Jo floo up, exclaeming
with alarm, "Mursy me! it's yuur grandpa!"</p>

<p>"Wel, whut if it is? U ar not afraed of anything, U noe,"
returnd th boy, luuking wiked.</p>

<p>"I think I am a litl bit afraed of him, but I don't noe whi I
should be. Marmee sed I miet cum, and I don't think U're
any th wurss for it," sed Jo, compoezing herself, tho she kept her
ies on th dor.</p>

<p>"I'm a graet deel beter for it, and ever so much obliejd. I'm
<span class="pagenum2">66</span>
oenly afraed U ar verry tierd tauking to me; it wuz <em>so</em> plezant, I
couldn't baer to stop," sed Laurie graetfuly.</p>

<p>"Th doktor to see U, sur," and th maed becond as she
spoek.</p>

<p>"Wuud U miend if I left U for a mienuet? I supoez I must
see him," sed Laurie.</p>

<p>"Don't miend me. I'm as hapy as a criket heer," anserd Jo.</p>

<p>Laurie went away, and his guessed amuezd herself in her oen wae.
She wuz standing befor a fien portrait of th oeld jentlman, when
th dor oepend again, and, without turning, she sed decidedly,
"I'm shuur now that I shouldn't be afraed of him, for he's got kiend
ies, tho his mouth is grim, and he luuks as if he had a tremendous
wil of his oen. He isn't as handsum as <em>mi</em> grandfaather, but
I liek him."</p>

<p>"Thank U, maa'am," sed a gruf vois behind her; and thaer,
to her graet dismae, stuud oeld Mr. Laurence.</p>

<p>Puur Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any reder, and her hart
began to beet uncumfortably fast as she thaut whut she had sed.
For a mienuet a wield dezier to run away possessed her; but that wuz
cowardly, and th gurls wuud laf at her: so she rezolvd to stae,
and get out of th scraep as she cuud. A second luuk shoed her
that th living ies, under th bushy grae iebrows, wer kiender eeven
than th paented wuns; and thaer wuz a sli twinkle in them, which lesend
her feer a guud deel. Th gruf vois wuz gruffer than ever,
as th oeld jentlman sed abruptly, after that dredful pause, "So
U're not afraed of me, hae?"</p>

<p>"Not much, sur."</p>

<p>"And U don't think me as handsum as yuur grandfaather?"</p>

<p>"Not qiet, sur."</p>

<p>"And I've got a tremendous wil, hav I?"</p>

<p>"I oenly sed I thaut so."</p>

<p>"But U liek me, in spiet of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, sur."</p>

<p>That anser pleezd th oeld jentlman; he gaev a short laf,
shuuk hands with her, and, putting his fingger under her chin, turnd
up her faess, examind it gravely, and let it go, saeing, with a nod,
<span class="pagenum2">67</span>
"U've got yuur grandfaather's spirit, if U haeven't his faess. He
<em>wuz</em> a fien man, mi deer; but, whut is beter, he wuz a braev and
an onest wun, and I
wuz proud to be his
frend."</p>

<p>"Thank U, sur;"
and Jo wuz qiet comfortable
after that, for
it suited her exaktly.</p>

<p>"Whut hav U
been dooing to this boy
of mien, hae?" wuz
th next qeschon,
sharply put.</p>

<p>"Oenly trieing to be
naeborly, sur;" and
Jo toeld how her vizit
caem about.</p>

<p>"U think he needs
cheering up a bit, do
U?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sur; he seems
a litl loenly, and
yung foeks wuud do
him guud perhaps.
We ar oenly gurls, but
we should be glad to help if we cuud, for we don't forget th splendid
Christmas prezent U sent us," sed Jo eegerly.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, tut! that wuz th boy's affair. How is th puur wuuman?"</p>

<p>"Dooing niesly, sur;" and off went Jo, tauking verry fast, as she toeld
all about th Hummels, in hoom her muther had interested richer
frends than thae wer.</p>

<p>"Just her faather's wae of dooing guud. I shal cum and see yuur
muther sum fien dae. Tel her so. Thaer's th tee-bel; we hav
it eerly, on th boy's account. Cum doun, and go on being
naeborly."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">68</span>
"If U'd liek to hav me, sur."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't ask U, if I didn't;" and Mr. Laurence oferd her
his arm with oeld-fashond courtesy.</p>

<p>"Whut <em>wuud</em> Meg sae to this?" thaut Jo, as she wuz marcht
away, whiel her ies danst with fun as she imajind herself teling
th story at hoem.</p>

<p>"Hae! Whi, whut th dickens has cum to th felo?" sed th
oeld jentlman, as Laurie caem runing doun staers, and brought up
with a start of serpriez at th astonishing siet of Jo arm-in-arm with
his re-doutabl grandfaather.</p>

<p>"I didn't noe U'd cum, sur," he began, as Jo gaev him a
triumphant litl glanss.</p>

<p>"That's evident, by th wae U raket doun staers. Cum to
yuur tee, sur, and behaev liek a jentlman;" and having puuld th
boy's haer by wae of a caress, Mr. Laurence waukt on, whiel Laurie
went thru a seerys of comik evolutions behind thaer baks, which
neerly produced an exploezhon of lafter from Jo.</p>

<p>Th oeld jentlman did not sae much as he drank his foer cups of
tee, but he wocht th yung peepl, hoo soon chated away liek
oeld frends, and th chaenj in his grandson did not escaep him.
Thaer wuz culor, liet, and lief in th boy's faess now, vivacity in his
maner, and jenuein merriment in his laf.</p>

<p>"She's riet; th lad <em>is</em> loenly. I'll see whut thees litl gurls
can do for him," thaut Mr. Laurence, as he luukt and lisend.
He liked Jo, for her od, blunt waes suited him; and she seemd
to understand th boy aulmoest as wel as if she had been wun herself.</p>

<p>If th Laurences had been whut Jo called "prim and poky," she
wuud not hav got on at all, for such peepl aulwaes maed her shi
and aukward; but fiending them free and eezy, she wuz so herself, and
maed a guud impreshon. When thae roez she propoezd to go, but
Laurie sed he had sumthing mor to sho her, and tuuk her away
to th conservatory, which had been lieted for her benefit. It
seemd qiet fairylike to Jo, as she went up and doun th wauks,
enjoying th blooming wauls on eether sied, th soft liet, th damp
<ins title="Change weet to sweet.">  
sweet aer, and th wunderful viens</ins> and trees that hung abuv 
her,—whiel
<span class="pagenum2">69</span>
her nue frend cut th fienest flowers till his hands wer fuul;
then he tied them up, saeing, with th hapy luuk Jo liked to see,
"Pleez giv thees to yuur muther, and tel her I liek th medisin
she sent me verry much."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 467px;">

</div>

<p>Thae found Mr. Laurence standing befor th fier in th graet
drawing-room, but Jo's atenshon wuz entierly absorbd by a grand
piano, which stuud oepen.</p>

<p>"Do U plae?" she askt, turning to Laurie with a respektful
expreshon.</p>

<p>"Sumtiems," he anserd modestly.</p>

<p>"Pleez do now. I wont to heer it, so I can tel Beth."</p>

<p>"Wun't U furst?"</p>

<p>"Don't noe how; too stoopid to lurn, but I luv muezik deerly."</p>

<p>So Laurie plaed, and Jo lisend, with her noez lugzhuriusly berryd
<span class="pagenum2">70</span>
in heeliotroep and tee-roezes. Her respekt and regard for th "Laurence
boy" increest verry much, for he plaed remarkably wel, and
didn't put on any aers. She wisht Beth cuud heer him, but she
did not sae so; oenly praezd him till he wuz qiet abasht, and his
grandfaather caem to th rescue. "That wil do, that wil do, yung
laedy. Too meny sugar-plums ar not guud for him. His muezik isn't
bad, but I hoep he wil do as wel in mor important things. Going?
Wel, I'm much obliejd to U, and I hoep U'll cum again.
Mi respekts to yuur muther. Guud-niet, Doktor Jo."</p>

<p>He shuuk hands kiendly, but luukt as if sumthing did not pleez
him. When thae got into th haul, Jo askt Laurie if she had sed
anything amis. He shuuk his hed.</p>

<p>"No, it wuz me; he doesn't liek to heer me plae."</p>

<p>"Whi not?"</p>

<p>"I'll tel U sum dae. John is going hoem with U, as I
can't."</p>

<p>"No need of that; I am not a yung laedy, and it's oenly a
step. Taek caer of yuurself, wun't U?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but U wil cum again, I hoep?"</p>

<p>"If U promis to cum and see us after U ar wel."</p>

<p>"I wil."</p>

<p>"Guud-niet, Laurie!"</p>

<p>"Guud-niet, Jo, guud-niet!"</p>

<p>When all th afternoon's advenchers had been toeld, th family
felt inclined to go viziting in a body, for eech found sumthing verry
atraktiv in th big hous on th uther sied of th hej. Mrs.
March wontedw to tauk of her faather with th oeld man hoo had not
forgoten him; Meg longed to wauk in th conservatory; Beth sighed
for th grand piano; and Amy wuz eeger to see th fien pikchers and
stachoos.</p>

<p>"Muther, whi didn't Mr. Laurence liek to hav Laurie plae?"
askt Jo, hoo wuz of an inqiering dispozishon.</p>

<p>"I am not shuur, but I think it wuz because his sun, Laurie's faather,
marryd an Italian laedy, a muezishan, which displeezd th oeld man,
hoo is verry proud. Th laedy wuz guud and luvly and accomplished,
but he did not liek her, and never saw his sun after he marryd.
<span class="pagenum2">71</span>
Thae boeth died when Laurie wuz a litl chield, and then his grandfaather
tuuk him hoem. I fansy th boy, hoo wuz born in Italy, is
not verry strong, and th oeld man is afraed of loozing him, which maeks
him so careful. Laurie cums nacheraly by his luv of muezik, for he
is liek his muther, and I daer sae his grandfaather feers that he mae
wont to be a muezishan; at any raet, his skil remiends him of th
wuuman he did not liek, and so he 'glowerd,' as Jo sed."</p>

<p>"Deer me, how roemantik!" exclaemd Meg.</p>

<p>"How sily!" sed Jo. "Let him be a muezishan, if he wonts to,
and not plaeg his lief out sending him to colej, when he haets to
go."</p>

<p>"That's whi he has such handsum blak ies and prity maners,
I supoez. Italians ar aulwaes niess," sed Meg, hoo wuz a litl
sentimental.</p>

<p>"Whut do U noe about his ies and his maners? U never
spoek to him, hardly," cried Jo, hoo wuz <em>not</em> sentimental.</p>

<p>"I saw him at th party, and whut U tel shoes that he noes
how to behaev. That wuz a niess litl speech about th medisin
muther sent him."</p>

<p>"He ment th blanc-maenj, I supoez."</p>

<p>"How stoopid U ar, chield! He ment U, of corss."</p>

<p>"Did he?" and Jo oepend her ies as if it had never ocurd to
her befor.</p>

<p>"I never saw such a gurl! U don't noe a compliment when
U get it," sed Meg, with th aer of a yung laedy hoo knew all
about th mater.</p>

<p>"I think thae ar graet nonsenss, and I'll thank U not to be sily,
and spoil mi fun. Laurie's a niess boy, and I liek him, and I wun't
hav any sentimental stuf about compliments and such rubish.
We'll all be guud to him, because he hasn't got any muther, and he
<em>mae</em> cum oever and see us, mayn't he, Marmee?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jo, yuur litl frend is verry welcum, and I hoep Meg
wil remember that children should be children as long as thae
can."</p>

<p>"I don't call mieself a chield, and I'm not in mi teens yet," obzurvd
Amy. "Whut do U sae, Beth?"</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">72</span>
"I wuz thinking about our 'Pilgrim's Progres,'" anserd Beth,
hoo had not hurd a wurd. "How we got out of th Slough and
thru th Wiket Gaet by rezolving to be guud, and up th steep
hil by trieing; and that maebe th hous oever thaer, fuul of splendid
things, is going to be our Palis Buetiful."</p>

<p>"We hav got to get by th lieons, furst," sed Jo, as if she rather
liked th prospekt.</p>

<p class="h2a">BETH Fiends Th Palis Buetiful.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Th</span>
big hous did proov a Palis Buetiful, tho it tuuk sum tiem
for all to get in, and Beth found it verry hard to pas th lieons. Oeld
Mr. Laurence wuz th bigest wun; but after he had called, sed sumthing
funy or kiend to eech wun of th gurls, and taukt oever oeld times
with thaer muther, noebody felt much afraed of him, exsept timid Beth.
Th uther lieon wuz th fakt that thae wer puur and Laurie rich; for
this maed them shi of accepting faevors which thae cuud not return.
But, after a whiel, thae found that he considerd them th benefaktors,
and cuud not do enough to sho how graetful he wuz for Mrs. March's
mutherly welcum, thaer cheerful soesieety, and th cumfort he tuuk in
that humbl hoem of theirs. So thae soon forgot thaer pride, and interchaenjd
kiendneses without stoping to think which wuz th graeter.</p>

<p>All sorts of plezant things happened about that tiem; for th nue
frendship flurisht liek gras in spring. Every wun liked Laurie,
and he privately informd his tuetor that "th Marches wer reguelarly
splendid gurls." With th delietful enthusiasm of yooth, thae tuuk th
solitaery boy into thaer midst, and maed much of him, and he found sumthing
verry charming in th inosent companyonship of thees simpl-hearted
gurls. Never having noen muther or sisters, he wuz qik to
feel th inflooenses thae brought about him; and thaer busy, lievly
waes maed him ashamed of th indolent lief he led. He wuz tierd
of books, and found peepl so interesting now that Mr. Brooke wuz
obliejd to maek verry unsatisfaktory reports; for Laurie wuz aulwaes
plaeing truant, and runing oever to th Marches.</p>

<p>"Never miend; let him taek a holidae, and maek it up afterwards,"
sed th oeld jentlman. "Th guud laedy next dor sez he is studying
<span class="pagenum2">74</span>
too hard, and needs yung soesieety, amuezment, and exercise. I
suspekt she is riet, and that I've been codling th felo as if I'd
been his grandmuther. Let him do whut he lieks, as long as he is
hapy. He can't get into mischif in that litl nunery oever thaer;
and Mrs. March is dooing mor for him than we can."</p>

<p>Whut guud times thae had, to be shuur! Such plaes and tableaux,
such slae-rieds and skaeting froliks, such plezant evenings in th oeld
parlor, and now and then such gae litl partys at th graet hous.
Meg cuud wauk in th conservatory whenever she liked, and revel in
bouquets; Jo browsed oever th nue liebraery voraeshusly, and convulst
th oeld jentlman with her critisizms; Amy copyd pikchers, and enjoyd
buety to her hart's content; and Laurie plaed "lord of th
manor" in th moest delietful stiel.</p>

<p>But Beth, tho yurning for th grand piano, cuud not pluk up
curej to go to th "Manshon of Bliss," as Meg called it. She went
wunss with Jo; but th oeld jentlman, not being aware of her infurmity,
staerd at her so hard from under his hevy iebrows, and sed "Hae!"
so loud, that he frietend her so much her "feet chaterd on th
flor," she toeld her muther; and she ran away, declaering she wuud
never go thaer any mor, not eeven for th deer piano. No persuasions
or entiesments cuud oevercum her feer, till, th fakt cuming to
Mr. Laurence's eer in sum misteerius wae, he set about mending
maters. Duuring wun of th brief calls he maed, he artfuly led th
conversation to muezik, and taukt away about graet singers hoom he
had seen, fien organs he had hurd, and toeld such charming anekdoets
that Beth found it imposibl to stae in her distant corner, but crept
neerer and neerer, as if fasinaeted. At th bak of his chaer she
stopt, and stuud lisening, with her graet ies wied oepen, and her
cheeks red with th exsietment of this uenuezhual performance. Taeking
no mor noetis of her than if she had been a fli, Mr. Laurence taukt
on about Laurie's lesons and teechers; and prezently, as if th iedeea
had just ocurd to him, he sed to Mrs. March,—</p>

<p>"Th boy neglekts his muezik now, and I'm glad of it, for he wuz
geting too fond of it. But th piano sufers for wont of uez. Wouldn't
sum of yuur gurls liek to run oever, and practise on it now and then,
just to keep it in tuen, U noe, maa'am?"</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">75</span>
Beth tuuk a step forward, and prest her hands tightly together to
keep from claping them, for this wuz an irezistibl temptaeshon; and
th thaut of practising on that splendid instrument qiet tuuk her
breth away. Befor Mrs. March cuud replie, Mr. Laurence went on
with an od litl nod and smiel,—</p>

<p>"Thae needn't see or speek to any wun, but run in at any tiem; for
I'm shut up in mi study at th uther end of th hous, Laurie is
out a graet deel, and th survants ar never neer th drawing-room
after nien o'clok."</p>

<p>Heer he roez, as if going, and Beth maed up her miend to speek, for
that last araenjment left nuthing to be dezierd. "Pleez tel th yung
laedys whut I sae; and if thae don't caer to cum, whi, never miend."
<span class="pagenum2">76</span>
Heer a litl hand slipt into his, and Beth luukt up at him with a
faess fuul of gratitood, as she sed, in her urnest yet timid wae,—</p>

<p>"O sur, thae do caer, verry, verry much!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p>"Ar U th muezikal gurl?" he askt, without any startling "Hae!"
as he luukt doun at her verry kiendly.</p>

<p>"I'm Beth. I luv it deerly, and I'll cum, if U ar qiet shuur
noebody wil heer me—and be disturbs," she aded, feering to be
rood, and trembling at her oen boldness as she spoek.</p>

<p>"Not a soel, mi deer. Th hous is empty haf th dae; so
cum, and drum away as much as U liek, and I shal be obliejd to
U."</p>

<p>"How kiend U ar, sur!"</p>

<p>Beth blushed liek a roez under th frendly luuk he wor; but she
wuz not frietend now, and gaev th big hand a graetful sqeez,
because she had no wurds to thank him for th precious gift he had
given her. Th oeld jentlman softly stroekt th haer off her forhed,
and, stooping doun, he kist her, saeing, in a toen fue peepl
ever hurd,—</p>

<p>"I had a litl gurl wunss, with ies liek thees. God bles U, mi
deer! Guud dae, madam;" and away he went, in a graet hurry.</p>

<p>Beth had a rapcher with her muther, and then rusht up to impart
th glorius nues to her family of invalids, as th gurls wer not at
hoem. How blithely she sung that evening, and how thae all laft
at her, because she woek Amy in th niet by plaeing th piano on
her faess in her sleep. Next dae, having seen boeth th oeld and yung
jentlman out of th hous, Beth, after too or three retreets, faerly
got in at th sied-dor, and maed her wae, as noizlesly as any mous,
to th drawing-room, whaer her iedol stuud. Qiet by accident, of
corss, sum prity, eezy muezik lae on th piano; and, with trembling
finggers, and freeqent stops to lisen and luuk about, Beth at last
tucht th graet instrument, and straetwae forgot her feer, herself,
and everything else but th unspeekabl deliet which th muezik gaev
her, for it wuz liek th vois of a beluved frend.</p>

<p>She staed till Hannah caem to taek her hoem to diner; but she
had no apetiet, and cuud oenly sit and smiel upon every wun in a
jeneral staet of beatitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">77</span></p>

<p>
After that, th litl broun huud slipt thru th hej neerly
every dae, and th graet drawing-room wuz haunted by a tuenful spirit
that caem and went unseen.
She never knew
that Mr. Laurence ofen
oepend his study-dor
to heer th oeld-fashond
aers he liked; she never
saw Laurie mount gard
in th haul to worn th
survants away; she never
suspekted that th exercise-books
and nue songs
which she found in th
rak wer put thaer for
her especial benefit; and
when he taukt to her
about muezik at hoem, she
oenly thaut how kiend
he wuz to tel things that
helpt her so much. So
she enjoyd herself hartily,
and found, whut isn't
aulwaes th caess, that her
granted wish wuz all she
had hoept. Perhaps it
wuz because she wuz so graetful for this blesing that a graeter wuz
given her; at any raet, she dezurvd boeth.</p>

<p>"Muther, I'm going to wurk Mr. Laurence a paer of slipers. He
is so kiend to me, I must thank him, and I don't noe any uther wae.
Can I do it?" askt Beth, a fue weeks after that eventful call of his.</p>

<p>"Yes, deer. It wil pleez him verry much, and be a niess wae of
thanking him. Th gurls wil help U about them, and I wil pae for
th maeking up," replied Mrs. March, hoo tuuk peculiar plezher in
granting Beth's reqests, because she so seldom askt anything for
herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">78</span>
After meny seerius discushons with Meg and Jo, th patern wuz
choezen, th mateerials bought, and th slipers begun. A cluster of
graev yet cheerful panzys, on a deeper purpl ground, wuz pronounced
verry aproepriat and prity; and Beth wurkt away eerly
and laet, with ocaezhonal lifts oever hard parts. She wuz a nimbl litl
needl-wuuman, and thae wer finisht befor any wun got tierd of
them. Then she roet a verry short, simpl noet, and, with Laurie's
help, got them smugld on to th study-taebl wun morning befor th
oeld jentlman wuz up.</p>

<p>When this exsietment wuz oever, Beth waeted to see whut wuud
hapen. All that dae past, and a part of th next, befor any
acknowledgment arrived, and she wuz begining to feer she had
ofended her crochety frend. On th afternoon of th second dae,
she went out to do an errand, and giv puur Joanna, th invalid dol,
her daily exercise. As she caem up th street, on her return, she saw
three, yes, foer, heds poping in and out of th parlor windoes, and
th moement thae saw her, several hands wer waevd, and several joyful
voises screemd,—</p>

<p>"Heer's a leter from th oeld jentlman! Cum qik, and red
it!"</p>

<p>"O Beth, he's sent U—" began Amy, jesticuelaeting with
unseely enerjy; but she got no further, for Jo qencht her by
slaming doun th windo.</p>

<p>Beth huryd on in a flutter of suspenss. At th dor, her sisters
seezd and bor her to th parlor in a trieumfal procession, all pointing,
and all saeing at wunss, "Luuk thaer! luuk thaer!" Beth did
luuk, and turnd pale with deliet and serpriez; for thaer stuud a
litl cabinet-piano, with a leter lieing on th glosy lid, direkted, liek
a sien-bord, to "Mis Elizabeth March."</p>

<p>"For me?" gaspt Beth, hoelding on to Jo, and feeling as if
she should tumbl doun, it wuz such an oeverwhelming thing aultogether.</p>

<p>"Yes; all for U, mi precious! Isn't it splendid of him? Don't
U think he's th deerest oeld man in th wurld? Heer's th kee in
th leter. We didn't oepen it, but we ar dieing to noe whut he
sez," cried Jo, huging her sister, and ofering th noet.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">79</span>
"U red it! I can't, I feel so qeer! O, it is too luvly!"
and Beth hid her faess in Jo's apron, qiet upset by her prezent.</p>

<p>Jo oepend th paeper, and began to laf, for th furst wurds she
saw wer,—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smc">Mis March</span>:<br>
<span class="left-margin2em">"<i>Deer Madam</i>,—"</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"How niess it sounds! I wish sum wun wuud riet to me so!"
sed Amy, hoo thaut th oeld-fashond adres verry elegant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"'I hav had meny paers of slipers in mi lief, but I never had any
that suited me so wel as yuurs,'" continued Jo. "'Hart's-eez is
mi faevorit flower, and thees wil aulwaes remiend me of th jentl
giver. I liek to pae mi dets; so I noe U wil alow "th oeld
jentlman" to send U sumthing which wunss belongd to th litl
granddauter he lost. With harty thanks and best wishes, 
<ins title="Add comma after I remain."> 
I remaen, </ins></p>

<p class="left-margin2em">"'Yuur graetful frend and humbl survant,</p>
<p class="right smc">"'James Laurence.'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Thaer, Beth, that's an onor to be proud of, I'm shuur! Laurie
toeld me how fond Mr. Laurence uezd to be of th chield hoo died,
and how he kept all her litl things carefully. Just think, he's given
U her piano. That cums of having big bloo ies and luving
muezik," sed Jo, trieing to sooth Beth, hoo trembld, and luukt
mor exsieted than she had ever been befor.</p>

<p>"See th cuning brakets to hoeld candles, and th niess green
silk, pukerd up, with a goeld roez in th midl, and th prity rak
and stool, all complete," aded Meg, oepening th instrument and
displaeing its beauties.</p>

<p>"'Yuur humbl survant, James Laurence'; oenly think of his rieting
that to U. I'll tel th gurls. Thae'll think it's splendid,"
sed Amy, much imprest by th noet.</p>

<p>"Tri it, huny. Let's heer th sound of th baeby-pianny,"
sed Hannah, hoo aulwaes tuuk a shaer in th family joys and sorroes.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">80</span>
So Beth tried it; and every wun pronounced it th moest remarkabl
piano ever hurd. It had evidently been nuely tuend and put in
apl-pie order; but, perfect as it wuz, I think th reeal charm of
it lae in th hapyest of all hapy faeses which leend oever it, as Beth
luvingly tucht th buetiful blak and whiet kees and prest th
briet pedals.</p>

<p>"U'll hav to go and thank him," sed Jo, by wae of a joek; for
th iedeea of th chield's reealy going never entered her hed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I meen to. I ges I'll go now, befor I get frietend
thinking about it." And, to th uter amaezment of th asembld
family, Beth waukt deliberatly doun th garden, thru th hej,
and in at th Laurences' dor.</p>

<p>"Wel, I wish I mae die if it ain't th qeerest thing I ever see!
Th pianny has turnd her hed! She'd never hav gon in her
riet miend," cried Hannah, staering after her, whiel th gurls wer
renderd qiet speechles by th mirakl.</p>

<p>Thae wuud hav been still mor amaezd if thae had seen whut
Beth did afterward. If U wil beleev me, she went and nokt at
th study-dor befor she gaev herself tiem to think; and when a
gruf vois called out, "Cum in!" she did go in, riet up to Mr.
Laurence, hoo luukt qiet taeken abak, and held out her hand, saeing,
with oenly a small qaever in her vois, "I caem to thank U,
sur, for—" But she didn't finish; for he luukt so frendly that
she forgot her speech, and, oenly remembering that he had lost th
litl gurl he luvd, she put boeth arms round his nek, and kist
him.</p>

</div>

<p>If th roof of th hous had sudenly floen off, th oeld jentlman
wouldn't hav been mor astonisht; but he liked it,—o, deer,
yes, he liked it amaezingly!—and wuz so tucht and pleezd by
that confieding litl kis that all his crustiness vanisht; and he just
set her on his nee, and laed his rinkld cheek against her roezy wun,
feeling as if he had got his oen litl granddauter bak again.
Beth seest to feer him from that moement, and sat thaer tauking to
him as cosily as if she had noen him all her lief; for luv casts out
feer, and gratitood can conker pride. When she went hoem, he
waukt with her to her oen gaet, shuuk hands corjaly, and tucht
<span class="pagenum2">81</span>
his hat as he marcht bak again, luuking verry stately and erekt, liek
a handsum, soeljerly oeld jentlman, as he wuz.</p>

<p>When th gurls saw that performance, Jo began to danss a jig, by
wae of expresing her satisfakshon; Amy neerly fel out of th windo
in her serpriez; and Meg exclaemd, with uplifted hands, "Wel, I do
beleev th wurld is cuming to an end!"</p>

<p>
<span class="smc">"That</span>

sed Amy, wun dae, as Laurie claterd
by on horsbak, with a flurish of his
whip as he past.</p>

<p>"How daer U sae so, when he's
got boeth his ies? and verry handsum
wuns thae ar, too," cried Jo, hoo rezented
any slighting remarks about her

<p>"I didn't sae anything about his

up when I admier his rieding."</p>

<p>"O, mi guudnes! that litl gooss
means a sentor, and she called him a
Sieclops," exclaemd Jo, with a burst of
lafter.</p>

<p>"U needn't be so rood; it's oenly
a 'laps of lingy,' as Mr. Davis sez,"
retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her
Latin. "I just wish I had a litl of th muny Laurie spends on
that horss," she aded, as if to herself, yet hoeping her sisters wuud
heer.</p>

<p>"Whi?" askt Meg kiendly, for Jo had gon off in anuther laf
at Amy's second blunder.</p>

<p>"I need it so much; I'm dredfuly in det, and it wun't be mi

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">83</span>
"In det, Amy? Whut do U meen?" and Meg luukt soeber.</p>

<p>"Whi, I oe at leest a duzen pikld liems, and I can't pae them,

<p>"Tel me all about it. Ar liems th fashon now? It uezd to be
priking bits of ruber to maek bauls;" and Meg tried to keep her
countenanss, Amy luukt so graev and important.</p>

<p>"Whi, U see, th gurls ar aulwaes buying them, and unles U
wont to be thaut meen, U must do it, too. It's nuthing but
liems now, for every wun is suking them in thaer desks in scool-tiem,
and traeding them off for pensils, beed-rings, paeper dols, or sumthing
else, at resess (vurb). If wun gurl lieks anuther, she givs her a liem; if
she's mad with her, she eets wun befor her faess, and don't ofer
eeven a suk. Thae treat by turns; and I've had ever so meny, but
haeven't returnd them; and I aut, for thae ar dets of onor, U

<p>"How much wil pae them off, and restor yuur credit?" askt
Meg, taeking out her purss.</p>

<p>"A qorter wuud mor than do it, and leev a fue sents oever for

<p>"Not much; U mae hav mi shaer. Heer's th muny. Maek

<p>"O, thank U! It must be so niess to hav poket-muny! I'll
hav a grand feest, for I haeven't taested a liem this week. I felt
delicat about taeking any, as I couldn't return them, and I'm akchualy
sufering for wun."</p>

<p>Next dae Amy wuz rather laet at scool; but cuud not rezist
th temptaeshon of displaeing, with pardonable pride, a moist broun-paeper
parsel, befor she consiend it to th inmoest reseses (vurb) of her
desk. Duuring th next fue minits th roomor that Amy March had
got twenty-foer delicious liems (she aet wun on th wae), and wuz
going to treat, surcuelaeted thru her "set," and th atenshons of her
frends becaem qiet oeverwhelming. Katy Broun invieted her to her
next party on th spot; Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her
woch till resess (vurb); and Jeny Sno, a satirikal yung laedy, hoo had
basely twitted Amy upon her limeless staet, promptly berryd th hatchet,
<span class="pagenum2">84</span>
and oferd to furnish ansers to surten apauling sums. But Amy
had not forgoten Mis Sno's cuting remarks about "sum pursons
hoos noezes wer not too flat to smel uther peepl's liems, and
stuk-up peepl, hoo wer not too proud to ask for them;" and she
instantly crusht "that Sno gurl's" hoeps by th withering telegram,
"U needn't be so poliet all of a suden, for U wun't get
any."</p>

<p>A distingwhisht pursonej happened to vizit th scool that morning,
and Amy's beautifully drawn maps reseevd praez, which onor
to her foe rankld in th soel of Mis Sno, and cauzd Mis March
to asuem th aers of a stoodius yung peacock. But, alas, alas!
pride goes befor a faul, and th revenjful Sno turnd th taebls
with dizastrus success. No sooner had th guessed paed th uezhual
stael compliments, and bowd himself out, than Jeny, under preetenss
of asking an important qeschon, informd Mr. Davis, th teecher,
that Amy March had pikld liems in her desk.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Davis had declaerd liems a contraband artikl, and solemly
vowd to publikly ferrule th furst purson hoo wuz found braeking
th law. This much-enduuring man had succeeded in banishing
chooing-gum after a long and stormy wor, had maed a bonfier of th
confiscated novels and nuezpaepers, had suprest a private poest-ofis,
had forbiden distorshons of th faess, niknaems, and caricatures,
and dun all that wun man cuud do to keep haf a hundred rebelyus
gurls in order. Boys ar trieing enough to hueman paeshenss, guudnes
noes! but gurls ar infinitly mor so, especially to nurvus jentlmen,
with tyrannical tempers, and no mor talent for teeching than
Dr. Blimber. Mr. Davis knew any qontity of Greek, Latin, Aljebra,
and ologies of all sorts, so he wuz called a fien teecher; and
maners, morals, feelings, and exampls wer not considerd of any
particular importanss. It wuz a moest unforchunat moement for denounsing
Amy, and Jeny knew it. Mr. Davis had evidently taeken
his cofy too strong that morning; thaer wuz an eest wiend, which
aulwaes affected his nuuralja; and his pupils had not dun him th
credit which he felt he dezurvd: thaerfor, to uez th expresiv,
if not elegant, langgwej of a scool-gurl, "he wuz as nurvus as a
wich and as cros as a baer." Th wurd "liems" wuz liek fier to
<span class="pagenum2">85</span>
pouder; his yelo faess flusht, and he rapped on his desk with an
enerjy which maed Jeny skip to her seet with uenuezhual rapidity.</p>

<p>"Yung laedys, atenshon, if U pleez!"</p>

<p>At th sturn order th buz seest, and fifty paers of bloo, blak,
grae, and broun ies wer oebeedi’ently fixed upon his auful countenanss.</p>

<p>"Mis March, cum to th desk."</p>

<p>Amy roez to comply with outward composure, but a seecret feer oprest
her, for th liems waed upon her conshenss.</p>

<p>"Bring with U th liems U hav in yuur desk," wuz th unexpekted
comand which arest her befor she got out of her seet.</p>

<p>"Don't taek all," whisperd her naebor, a yung laedy of graet
presence of miend.</p>

<p>Amy haestily shuuk out haf a duzen, and laed th rest doun befor
Mr. Davis, feeling that any man possessing a hueman hart wuud
relent when that delicious perfume met his noez. Unforchunatly,
Mr. Davis particularly detested th odor of th fashonabl pikl,
and disgust aded to his rath.</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Not qiet," stamerd Amy.</p>

<p>"Bring th rest imeediatly."</p>

<p>With a despaering glanss at her set, she oebaed.</p>

<p>"U ar shuur thaer ar no mor?"</p>

<p>"I never lie, sur."</p>

<p>"So I see. Now taek thees disgusting things too by too, and thro
them out of th windo."</p>

<p>Thaer wuz a simultaneous sie, which creaeted qiet a litl gust, as
th last hoep fled, and th treat wuz ravisht from thaer longing lips.
Scarlet with shaem and angger, Amy went to and fro six dredful
times; and as eech doomed cupl—luuking o! so plump and
joosy—fel from her reluktant hands, a shout from th street completed
th anguish of th gurls, for it toeld them that thaer feest wuz being exulted
oever by th litl Irish children, hoo wer thaer sworn foes. This—this
wuz too much; all flasht indignant or apeeling glanses at th
inexsorabl Davis, and wun pashonat liem-luver burst into teers.</p>

<p>As Amy returnd from her last trip, Mr. Davis gaev a portentous
"Hem!" and sed, in his moest impresiv maner,—</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">86</span>
"Yung laedys, U remember whut I sed to U a week ago. I
am sorry this has happened, but I never alow mi rools to be infrinjd,
and I <em>never</em> braek mi wurd. Mis March, hoeld out yuur
hand."</p>

<p>Amy started, and put boeth hands behind her, turning on him an
imploring luuk which pleeded for her beter than th wurds she
cuud not uter. She wuz rather a faevorit with "oeld Davis," as, of
corss, he wuz called, and it's mi private beleef that he <em>wuud</em> hav
broeken his wurd if th indignaeshon of wun irepresibl yung laedy had
not found vent in a hiss. That hiss, faent as it wuz, iritaeted th
irasibl jentlman, and seeld th culprit's faet.</p>

<p>"Yuur hand, Mis March!" wuz th oenly anser her muet apeel
reseevd; and, too proud to cri or beseech, Amy set her teeth,
<span class="pagenum2">87</span>
throo bak her hed defieantly, and bor without flinching several
tingling bloes on her litl paam. Thae wer neether meny nor hevy,
but that maed no diferenss to her. For th furst tiem in her lief she
had been struk; and th disgraess, in her ies, wuz as deep as if he
had nokt her doun.</p>

<p>"U wil now stand on th platform till resess (vurb)," sed Mr. Davis,
rezolvd to do th thing thuroely, sinss he had begun.</p>

<p>That wuz dredful. It wuud hav been bad enough to go to her
seet, and see th pitying faeses of her frends, or th satisfied wuns of
her fue enemys; but to faess th hoel scool, with that shaem fresh
upon her, seemd imposibl, and for a second she felt as if she
cuud oenly drop doun whaer she stuud, and braek her hart with
crieing. A biter senss of rong, and th thaut of Jeny Sno,
helpt her to baer it; and, taeking th ignominus plaess, she fixed
her ies on th stoev-funel abuv whut now seemd a see of faeses,
and stuud thaer, so moeshonles and whiet that th gurls found it verry
hard to study, with that pathetik figuer befor them.</p>

<p>Duuring th fifteen minits that foloed, th proud and sensitive
litl gurl suferd a shaem and paen which she never forgot. To
others it miet seem a loodicrus or trivial affair, but to her it wuz a
hard expeeri’enss; for duuring th twelve yeers of her lief she had been
guvernd by luv aloen, and a blo of that sort had never tucht
her befor. Th smart of her hand and th aek of her hart wer
forgoten in th sting of th thaut,—</p>

<p>"I shal hav to tel at hoem, and thae wil be so disapointed in
me!"</p>

<p>Th fifteen minits seemd an our; but thae caem to an end at
last, and th wurd "Resess (vurb)!" had never seemd so welcum to her
befor.</p>

<p>"U can go, Mis March," sed Mr. Davis, luuking, as he felt,
uncumfortabl.</p>

<p>He did not soon forget th reproechful glanss Amy gaev him, as she
went, without a wurd to any wun, straet into th ante-room, snacht
her things, and left th plaess "forever," as she pashonatly declaerd
to herself. She wuz in a sad staet when she got hoem; and when
th oelder gurls arrived, sum tiem laeter, an indignaeshon meeting wuz
<span class="pagenum2">88</span>
held at wunss. Mrs. March did not sae much, but luukt disturbs,
and cumforted her aflikted litl dauter in her tenderest maner.
Meg baethd th insulted hand with gliserin and teers; Beth felt
that eeven her beluved kitens wuud fael as a balm for griefs liek this;
Jo rathfuly propoezd that Mr. Davis be arest without delae;
and Hannah shuuk her fist at th "vilan," and pounded potaetoes
for diner as if she had him under her pesl.</p>

<p>No noetis wuz taeken of Amy's fliet, exsept by her maets; but th
sharp-ied demoiselles discuverd that Mr. Davis wuz qiet benignant
in th afternoon, aulso unuezhualy nurvus. Just befor scool cloezd,
Jo apeerd, waering a grim expreshon, as she staukt up to th
desk, and deliverd a leter from her muther; then colekted Amy's
property, and departed, carefully scraeping th mud from her boots on
th dor-mat, as if she shuuk th dust of th plaess off her feet.</p>

<p>"Yes, U can hav a vaecaeshon from scool, but I wont U to
study a litl every dae, with Beth," sed Mrs. March, that evening.
"I don't aproov of corporal punishment, especially for gurls. I
disliek Mr. Davis's maner of teeching, and don't think th gurls U
asoeshiat with ar dooing U any guud, so I shal ask yuur faather's
advice befor I send U anywhere else."</p>

<p>"That's guud! I wish all th gurls wuud leev, and spoil his oeld
scool. It's perfectly madening to think of thoes luvly liems,"
sighed Amy, with th aer of a marter.</p>

<p>"I am not sorry U lost them, for U broek th rools, and
dezurvd sum punishment for disoebeedi’enss," wuz th seveer replie,
which rather disapointed th yung laedy, hoo expected nuthing but
simpathy.</p>

<p>"Do U meen U ar glad I wuz disgraest befor th hoel
scool?" cried Amy.</p>

<p>"I should not hav choezen that wae of mending a fault," replied
her muther; "but I'm not shuur that it wun't do U mor guud than
a mielder method. U ar geting to be rather conseeted, mi deer,
and it is qiet tiem U set about corekting it. U hav a guud
meny litl gifts and vurchoos, but thaer is no need of parading them,
for conseet spoils th fienest jeenyus. Thaer is not much daenjer that
reeal talent or guudnes wil be oeverluukt long; eeven if it is, th
<span class="pagenum2">89</span>
conshusnes of possessing and uezing it wel should satisfi wun, and
th graet charm of all power is modesty."</p>

<p>"So it is!" cried Laurie, hoo wuz plaeing ches in a corner with
Jo. "I knew a gurl, wunss, hoo had a reealy remarkabl talent for
muezik, and she didn't noe it; never guessed whut sweet litl things
she compoezd when she wuz aloen, and wouldn't hav beleevd it if
any wun had toeld her."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd noen that niess gurl; maebe she wuud hav helpt
me, I'm so stoopid," sed Beth, hoo stuud besied him, lisening
eegerly.</p>

<p>"U do noe her, and she helps U beter than any wun else
cuud," anserd Laurie, luuking at her with such mischivus meening
in his merry blak ies, that Beth sudenly turnd verry red, and
hid her faess in th soefa-cuushon, qiet oevercum by such an unexpekted
discuvery.</p>

<p>Jo let Laurie win th gaem, to pae for that praez of her Beth, hoo
<span class="pagenum2">90</span>
cuud not be prevaeld upon to plae for them after her compliment.
So Laurie did his best, and sung delietfuly, being in a particularly
lievly huemor, for to th Marches he seldom shoed th moody sied
of his carrakter. When he wuz gon, Amy, hoo had been pensiv all
th evening, sed sudenly, as if busy oever sum nue iedeea,—</p>

<p>"Is Laurie an accomplished boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he has had an exselent ejucaeshon, and has much talent;
he wil maek a fien man, if not spoilt by peting," replied her
muther.</p>

<p>"And he isn't conseeted, is he?" askt Amy.</p>

<p>"Not in th leest; that is whi he is so charming, and we all liek
him so much."</p>

<p>"I see; it's niess to hav accomplishments, and be elegant; but
not to sho off, or get perked up," sed Amy thautfuly.</p>

<p>"Thees things ar aulwaes seen and felt in a purson's maner and
conversation, if modestly uezd; but it is not nesesaery to displae
them," sed Mrs. March.</p>

<p>"Any mor than it's proper to waer all yuur bonnets and gouns
and ribons at wunss, that foeks mae noe U've got them," aded
Jo; and th lecture ended in a laf.</p>

<p class="h2a">JO MEETS APOLLYON.</p>

<p>"<span class="smc">Gurls</span>, whaer ar U going?" askt Amy, cuming into thaer
room wun Saturday afternoon, and fiending them geting redy to go
out, with an aer of seecresy which exsieted her cueriosity.</p>

<p>"Never miend; litl gurls shouldn't ask qeschons," returnd Jo
sharply.</p>

<p>Now if thaer <em>is</em> anything mortifying to our feelings, when we ar
yung, it is to be toeld that; and to be bidden to "run away, deer,"
is still mor trieing to us. Amy bridled up at this insult, and deturmind
to fiend out th seecret, if she teezd for an our. Turning to
Meg, hoo never refuezd her anything verry long, she sed coaxingly,
"Do tel me! I should think U miet let me go, too; for Beth is
<span class="pagenum2">92</span>
fusing oever her piano, and I haeven't got anything to do, and am <em>so</em>
loenly."</p>

<p>"I can't, deer, because U aren't invieted," began Meg; but Jo
broek in impaeshently, "Now, Meg, be qieet, or U wil spoil it all.
U can't go, Amy; so don't be a baeby, and whien about it."</p>

<p>"U ar going sumwhaer with Laurie, I noe U ar; U wer
whispering and lafing together, on th soefa, last niet, and U
stopt when I caem in. Aren't U going with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we ar; now do be still, and stop bothering."</p>

<p>Amy held her tung, but uezd her ies, and saw Meg slip a fan
into her poket.</p>

<p>"I noe! I noe! U're going to th theeater to see th 'Seven
Casls!'" she cried; ading rezolootly, "and I <em>shal</em> go, for muther
sed I miet see it; and I've got mi rag-muny, and it wuz meen
not to tel me in tiem."</p>

<p>"Just lisen to me a mienuet, and be a guud chield," sed Meg
soothingly. "Muther doesn't wish U to go this week, because
yuur ies ar not wel enough yet to baer th liet of this faery peess.
Next week U can go with Beth and Hannah, and hav a niess
tiem."</p>

<p>"I don't liek that haf as wel as going with U and Laurie.
Pleez let me; I've been sik with this coeld so long, and shut up,
I'm dieing for sum fun. Do, Meg! I'll be ever so guud," pleeded
Amy, luuking as pathetik as she cuud.</p>

<p>"Supoez we taek her. I don't beleev muther wuud miend, if we
bundle her up wel," began Meg.</p>

<p>"If <em>she</em> goes <em>I</em> sha'n't; and if I don't, Laurie wun't liek it; and it
wil be verry rood, after he invieted oenly us, to go and drag in Amy.
I should think she'd haet to poek herself whaer she isn't wontedw,"
sed Jo crosly, for she disliekt th trubl of oeverseeing a fijety
chield, when she wontedw to enjoy herself.</p>

<p>Her toen and maner anggerd Amy, hoo began to put her boots
on, saeing, in her moest aggravating wae, "I <em>shal</em> go; Meg sez I
mae; and if I pae for mieself, Laurie hasn't anything to do with it."</p>

<p>"U can't sit with us, for our seets ar rezurvd, and U mustn't
sit aloen; so Laurie wil giv U his plaess, and that wil spoil our
<span class="pagenum2">93</span>
plezher; or he'll get anuther seet for U, and that isn't proper,
when U weren't askt. U sha'n't stur a step; so U mae just
stae whaer U ar," scoelded Jo, crosser than ever, having just prikt
her fingger in her hurry.</p>

<p>Sitting on th flor, with wun boot on, Amy began to cri, and Meg
to reezon with her, when Laurie called from beloe, and th too gurls
huryd doun, leeving thaer sister waeling; for now and then she
forgot her groen-up waes, and akted liek a spoilt chield. Just as th
party wuz setting out, Amy called oever th banisters, in a thretening
toen, "U'll be sorry for this, Jo March; see if U ain't."</p>

<p>"Fidlstiks!" returnd Jo, slaming th dor.</p>

<p>Thae had a charming tiem, for "Th Seven Casls of th Diemond
Laek" wer as brilliant and wunderful as hart cuud wish. But, in
spiet of th comikal red imps, sparkling elvs, and gorjus prinses
and princesses, Jo's plezher had a drop of bitterness in it; th faery
qeen's yelo curls remiended her of Amy; and between th akts she
amuezd herself with wundering whut her sister wuud do to maek her
"sorry for it." She and Amy had had meny lievly skirmishes in th
corss of thaer lievs, for boeth had qik tempers, and wer apt to be
vieolent when faerly rouzd. Amy teezd Jo, and Jo iritaeted Amy,
and semy-ocaezhonal exploezhons ocurd, of which boeth wer much
ashamed afterward. Aultho th oeldest, Jo had th leest self-controel,
and had hard times trieing to curb th fiery spirit which wuz
continually geting her into trubl; her angger never lasted long,
and, having humbly confest her fault, she sincerely repented, and
tried to do beter. Her sisters uezd to sae that thae rather liked to
get Jo into a fuery, because she wuz such an aenjel afterward. Puur
Jo tried desperatly to be guud, but her bosom enemy wuz aulwaes
redy to flaem up and defeet her; and it tuuk yeers of paeshent efort
to subdue it.</p>

<p>When thae got hoem, thae found Amy reeding in th parlor. She
asuemd an injerd aer as thae caem in; never lifted her ies from
her book, or askt a singgl qeschon. Perhaps cueriosity miet hav
conkerd rezentment, if Beth had not been thaer to inqier, and
reseev a gloeing descripshon of th plae. On going up to put away
her best hat, Jo's furst luuk wuz tord th bureau; for, in thaer last
<span class="pagenum2">94</span>
qorrel, Amy had soothd her feelings by turning Jo's top drawer
upsied doun on th flor. Everything wuz in its plaess, however;
and after a hasty glanss into her vaerius clozets, bags, and boxes, Jo
desieded that Amy had forgiven and forgoten her rongs.</p>

<p>Thaer Jo wuz mistaeken; for next dae she maed a discuvery which
produced a tempest. Meg, Beth, and Amy wer sitting together,
laet in th afternoon, when Jo burst into th room, luuking exsieted,
and demanding breathlessly, "Has any wun taeken mi book?"</p>

<p>Meg and Beth sed "No," at wunss, and luukt serpriezd; Amy
poekt th fier, and sed nuthing. Jo saw her culor riez, and wuz
doun upon her in a mienuet.</p>

<p>"Amy, U've got it?"</p>

<p>"No, I haeven't."</p>

<p>"U noe whaer it is, then?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't."</p>

<p>"That's a fib!" cried Jo, taeking her by th shoulders, and luuking
feerss enough to frieten a much braever chield than Amy.</p>

<p>"It isn't. I haeven't got it, don't noe whaer it is now, and don't
caer."</p>

<p>"U noe sumthing about it, and U'd beter tel at wunss, or
I'll maek U," and Jo gaev her a sliet shaek.</p>

<p>"Scoeld as much as U liek, U'll never see yuur sily oeld book
again," cried Amy, geting exsieted in her turn.</p>

<p>"Whi not?"</p>

<p>"I burnt it up."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 437px;">

</div>

<p>"Whut! mi litl book I wuz so fond of, and wurkt oever, and
ment to finish befor faather got hoem? Hav U reealy burnt it?"
sed Jo, turning verry pale, whiel her ies kindld and her hands
clutched Amy nurvusly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did! I toeld U I'd maek U pae for being so cros
yesterdae, and I hav, so—"</p>

<p>Amy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper masterd her, and she
shuuk Amy till her teeth chaterd in her hed; crieing, in a pashon
of greef and angger,—</p>

<p>"U wiked, wiked gurl! I never can riet it again, and I'll
never forgiv U as long as I liv."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">95</span>
Meg floo to rescue Amy, and Beth to pasifi Jo, but Jo wuz qiet
besied herself; and, with a parting box on her sister's eer, she rusht
out of th room up to th oeld soefa in th garret, and finisht her
fiet aloen.</p>

<p>Th storm cleerd up beloe, for Mrs. March caem hoem, and,
having hurd th story, soon brought Amy to a senss of th rong
she had dun her sister. Jo's book wuz th pride of her hart, and
wuz regarded by her family as a literaery sprout of graet promis. It
wuz oenly haf a duzen litl faery taels, but Jo had wurkt oever them
paeshently, putting her hoel hart into her wurk, hoeping to maek
sumthing guud enough to print. She had just copyd them with
graet caer, and had destroyd th oeld manuescript, so that Amy's
bonfier had consuemd th luving wurk of several yeers. It seemd
<span class="pagenum2">96</span>
a small lost to others, but to Jo it wuz a dredful calamity, and she
felt that it never cuud be maed up to her. Beth mornd as for a
departed kiten, and Meg refuezd to defend her pet; Mrs. March
luukt graev and greevd, and Amy felt that no wun wuud luv her
till she had askt pardon for th akt which she now regreted mor
than any of them.</p>

<p>When th tee-bel rung, Jo apeerd, luuking so grim and unapproachable
that it tuuk all Amy's curej to sae meekly,—</p>

<p>"Pleez forgiv me, Jo; I'm verry, verry sorry."</p>

<p>"I never shal forgiv U," wuz Jo's sturn anser; and, from that
moement, she ignord Amy entierly.</p>

<p>No wun spoek of th graet trubl,—not eeven Mrs. March,—for
all had lurnd by expeeri’enss that when Jo wuz in that mood wurds
wer waested; and th wiezest corss wuz to waet till sum litl
accident, or her oen jenerus naechuur, sofend Jo's rezentment, and
heeld th breach. It wuz not a hapy evening; for, tho thae
soed as uezhual, whiel thaer muther red aloud from Bremer, Scott, or
Edgeworth, sumthing wuz wonting, and th sweet hoem-peess wuz
disturbs. Thae felt this moest when singing-tiem caem; for Beth
cuud oenly plae, Jo stuud dum as a stoen, and Amy broek doun, so
Meg and muther sung aloen. But, in spiet of thaer eforts to be as
cheery as larks, th floot-liek voises did not seem to cord as wel as
uezhual, and all felt out of tuen.</p>

<p>As Jo reseevd her guud-niet kis, Mrs. March whisperd
jently,—</p>

<p>"Mi deer, don't let th sun go doun upon yuur angger; forgiv
eech uther, help eech uther, and begin again to-morro."</p>

<p>Jo wontedw to lae her hed doun on that mutherly bosom, and cri
her greef and angger all away; but teers wer an unmanly weeknes,
and she felt so deeply injerd that she reealy <em>couldn't</em> qiet forgiv
yet. So she winkt hard, shuuk her hed, and sed, grufly because
Amy wuz lisening,—</p>

<p>"It wuz an abominabl thing, and she don't dezurv to be forgiven."</p>

<p>With that she marcht off to bed, and thaer wuz no merry or
confidenshal gosip that niet.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">97</span>
Amy wuz much ofended that her oeverchers of peess had been
repulst, and began to wish she had not humbld herself, to feel
mor injerd than ever, and to plume herself on her superior vurchoo
in a wae which wuz particularly exasperaeting. Jo still luukt liek a
thunder-cloud, and nuthing went wel all dae. It wuz biter coeld in
th morning; she dropt her precious turn-oever in th gutter, Ant
March had an attack of fijets, Meg wuz pensiv, Beth <em>wuud</em> luuk
greevd and wistful when she got hoem, and Amy kept maeking
remarks about peepl hoo wer aulwaes tauking about being guud,
and yet wouldn't tri, when uther peepl set them a vurchu’us
exampl.</p>

<p>"Everybody is so haetful, I'll ask Laurie to go skaeting. He is
aulwaes kiend and joly, and wil put me to riets, I noe," sed Jo to
herself, and off she went.</p>

<p>Amy hurd th clash of skaets, and luukt out with an impaeshent
exclamation,—</p>

<p>"Thaer! she promist I should go next tiem, for this is th last
iess we shal hav. But it's no uez to ask such a cros-pach to taek
me."</p>

<p>"Don't sae that; U <em>wer</em> verry nauty, and it <em>is</em> hard to forgiv
th lost of her precious litl book; but I think she miet do it now,
and I ges she wil, if U tri her at th riet mienuet," sed
Meg. "Go after them; don't sae anything till Jo has got guud-naecherd
with Laurie, then taek a qieet mienuet, and just kis her, or do sum
kiend thing, and I'm shuur she'll be frends again, with all her
hart."</p>

<p>"I'll tri," sed Amy, for th advice suited her; and, after a flury
to get redy, she ran after th frends, hoo wer just disapeering
oever th hil.</p>

<p>It wuz not far to th river, but boeth wer redy befor Amy reached
them. Jo saw her cuming, and turnd her bak; Laurie did not
see, for he wuz carefully skaeting along th shor, sounding th iess,
for a worm spel had preceded th coeld snap.</p>

<p>"I'll go on to th furst bend, and see if it's all riet, befor we
begin to raess," Amy hurd him sae, as he shot away, luuking liek a
yung Russian, in his fur-trimmed coet and cap.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">98</span>
Jo hurd Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and bloeing
her finggers, as she tried to put her skaets on; but Jo never turnd,
and went sloely zagzaging doun th river, taeking a biter, unhapy
sort of satisfakshon in her sister's trubls. She had cherrisht her
angger till it groo strong, and tuuk possession of her, as eevil thoughts
and feelings aulwaes do, unles cast out at wunss. As Laurie turnd
th bend, he shouted bak,—</p>

<p>"Keep neer th shor; it isn't saef in th midl."</p>

<p>Jo hurd, but Amy wuz just strugling to her feet, and did not
cach a wurd. Jo glanst oever her shoulder, and th litl deemon
she wuz harboring sed in her eer,—</p>

<p>"No mater whether she hurd or not, let her taek caer of herself."</p>

<p>Laurie had vanisht round th bend; Jo wuz just at th turn, and
Amy, far behind, strieking out tord th smoother iess in th midl
of th river. For a mienuet Jo stuud still, with a straenj feeling at
her hart; then she rezolvd to go on, but sumthing held and
turnd her round, just in tiem to see Amy thro up her hands and
go doun, with th suden crash of roten iess, th splash of wauter,
and a cri that maed Jo's hart stand still with feer. She tried to call
Laurie, but her vois wuz gon; she tried to rush forward, but her
feet seemd to hav no strength in them; and, for a second, she
cuud oenly stand moeshonles, staering, with a terror-striken faess, at
th litl bloo huud abuv th blak wauter. Sumthing rusht swiftly
by her, and Laurie's vois cried out,—</p>

<p>"Bring a rael; qik, qik!"</p>

<p>How she did it, she never knew; but for th next fue minits she
wurkt as if possessed, bliendly oebaeing Laurie, hoo wuz qiet self-possessed,
and, lieing flat, held Amy up by his arm and hoky till
Jo dragd a rael from th fenss, and together thae got th chield out,
mor frietend than hurt.</p>

</div>

<p>"Now then, we must wauk her hoem as fast as we can; piel our
things on her, whiel I get off thees confounded skaets," cried Laurie,
raping his coet round Amy, and tuging away at th straps, which
never seemd so intricat befor.</p>

<p>Shivering, driping, and crieing, thae got Amy hoem; and, after
<span class="pagenum2">99</span>
an exsieting tiem of it, she fel asleep, roeld in blankets, befor a hot
fier. Duuring th busl Jo had scaersly spoeken; but floen about,
luuking pale and wield, with her things haf off, her dres torn, and
her hands cut and broozd by iess and raels, and refraktory bukls.
When Amy wuz comfortably asleep, th hous qieet, and Mrs. March
sitting by th bed, she called Jo to her, and began to biend up th
hurt hands.</p>

<p>"Ar U shuur she is saef?" whisperd Jo, luuking remorsfuly at
th goelden hed, which miet hav been swept away from her siet
forever under th treacherous iess.</p>

<p>"Qiet saef, deer; she is not hurt, and wun't eeven taek coeld, I
think, U wer so sensibl in cuvering and geting her hoem qikly,"
replied her muther cheerfuly.</p>

<p>"Laurie did it all; I oenly let her go. Muther, if she <em>should</em> die,
it wuud be mi fault"; and Jo dropt doun besied th bed, in a
pashon of penitent teers, teling all that had happened, biterly condeming
<span class="pagenum2">100</span>
her hardnes of hart, and sobing out her gratitood for
being spaerd th hevy punishment which miet hav cum upon
her.</p>

<p>"It's mi dredful temper! I tri to cuer it; I think I hav, and
then it braeks out wurss than ever. O muther, whut shal I do?
whut shal I do?" cried puur Jo, in despaer.</p>

<p>"Woch and prae, deer; never get tierd of trieing; and never think
it is imposibl to conker yuur fault," sed Mrs. March, drawing th
blowzy hed to her shoulder, and kissing th wet cheek so tenderly
that Jo cried harder than ever.</p>

<p>"U don't noe, U can't ges how bad it is! It seems as if
I cuud do anything when I'm in a pashon; I get so savej, I cuud
hurt any wun, and enjoy it. I'm afraed I <em>shal</em> do sumthing dredful
sum dae, and spoil mi lief, and maek everybody haet me. O
muther, help me, do help me!"</p>

<p>"I wil, mi chield, I wil. Don't cri so biterly, but remember
this dae, and rezolv, with all yuur soel, that U wil never noe
anuther liek it. Jo, deer, we all hav our temptaeshons, sum far
graeter than yuurs, and it ofen taeks us all our lievs to conker them.
U think yuur temper is th wurst in th wurld; but mien uezd to
be just liek it."</p>

<p>"Yuurs, muther? Whi, U ar never anggry!" and, for th moement,
Jo forgot remorss in serpriez.</p>

<p>"I've been trieing to cuer it for forty yeers, and hav oenly succeeded
in controeling it. I am anggry neerly every dae of mi lief, Jo;
but I hav lurnd not to sho it; and I still hoep to lurn not to
feel it, tho it mae taek me anuther forty yeers to do so."</p>

<p>Th paeshenss and th huemility of th faess she luvd so wel wuz a
beter leson to Jo than th wiezest lecture, th sharpest reproof.
She felt cumforted at wunss by th simpathy and confidenss given
her; th nolej that her muther had a fault liek hers, and tried
to mend it, maed her oen eezyer to baer and strengthend her rezolooshon
to cuer it; tho forty yeers seemd rather a long tiem to
woch and prae, to a gurl of fifteen.</p>

<p>"Muther, ar U anggry when U foeld yuur lips tight together,
and go out of th room sumtiems, when Ant March scoelds, or
<span class="pagenum2">101</span>
peepl wury U?" askt Jo, feeling neerer and deerer to her
muther than ever befor.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've lurnd to chek th hasty wurds that riez to mi lips;
and when I feel that thae meen to braek out against mi wil, I just
go away a mienuet, and giv mieself a litl shaek, for being so week
and wiked," anserd Mrs. March, with a sie and a smiel, as she
smoothd and fasend up Jo's dishevelled haer.</p>

<p>"How did U lurn to keep still? That is whut trubls me—for
th sharp wurds fli out befor I noe whut I'm about; and th
mor I sae th wurss I get, till it's a plezher to hurt peepl's feelings,
and sae dredful things. Tel me how U do it, Marmee
deer."</p>

<p>"Mi guud muther uezd to help me—"</p>

<p>"As U do us—" interupted Jo, with a graetful kis.</p>

<p>"But I lost her when I wuz a litl oelder than U ar, and for
yeers had to strugl on aloen, for I wuz too proud to confes mi
weeknes to any wun else. I had a hard tiem, Jo, and shed a guud
meny biter teers oever mi faeluers; for, in spiet of mi eforts, I never
seemd to get on. Then yuur faather caem, and I wuz so hapy that
I found it eezy to be guud. But by and by, when I had foer litl
dauters round me, and we wer puur, then th oeld trubl began
again; for I am not paeshent by naechuur, and it tried me verry much to
see mi children wonting anything."</p>

<p>"Puur muther! whut helpt U then?"</p>

<p>"Yuur faather, Jo. He never loozes paeshenss,—never doubts or
complaens,—but aulwaes hoeps, and wurks and waets so cheerfuly,
that wun is ashamed to do utherwiez befor him. He helpt and
cumforted me, and shoed me that I must tri to practise all th
vurchoos I wuud hav mi litl gurls possess, for I wuz thaer exampl.
It wuz eezyer to tri for yuur saeks than for mi oen; a startld or
serpriezd luuk from wun of U, when I spoek sharply, rebuekt me
mor than any wurds cuud hav dun; and th luv, respekt, and
confidenss of mi children wuz th sweetest reword I cuud reseev
for mi eforts to be th wuuman I wuud hav them copy."</p>

<p>"O muther, if I'm ever haf as guud as U, I shal be satisfied,"
cried Jo, much tucht.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">102</span>
"I hoep U wil be a graet deel beter, deer; but U must keep
woch oever yuur 'bosom enemy,' as faather calls it, or it mae sadden,
if not spoil yuur lief. U hav had a worning; remember it, and
tri with hart and soel to master this qik temper, befor it brings
U graeter sorro and regret than U hav noen to-dae."</p>

<p>"I wil tri, muther; I truly wil. But U must help me, remiend
me, and keep me from flieing out. I uezd to see faather sumtiems
put his fingger on his lips, and luuk at U with a verry kiend, but soeber
faess, and U aulwaes foelded yuur lips tight or went away: wuz he
remiending U then?" askt Jo softly.</p>

<p>"Yes; I askt him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but
saevd me from meny a sharp wurd by that litl jescher and kiend
luuk."</p>

<p>Jo saw that her muther's ies fild and her lips trembld, as she
spoek; and, feering that she had sed too much, she whisperd anxiously,
"Wuz it rong to woch U, and to speek of it? I didn't
meen to be rood, but it's so comfortable to sae all I think to U,
and feel so saef and hapy heer."</p>

<p>"Mi Jo, U mae sae anything to yuur muther, for it is mi graetest
hapynes and pride to feel that mi gurls confied in me, and noe
how much I luv them."</p>

<p>"I thaut I'd greevd U."</p>

<p>"No, deer; but speeking of faather remiended me how much I
mis him, how much I oe him, and how faethfuly I should woch
and wurk to keep his litl dauters saef and guud for him."</p>

<p>"Yet U toeld him to go, muther, and didn't cri when he went,
and never complaen now, or seem as if U needed any help," sed
Jo, wundering.</p>

<p>"I gaev mi best to th cuntry I luv, and kept mi teers till he
wuz gon. Whi should I complaen, when we boeth hav meerly dun
our duty and wil surely be th hapyer for it in th end? If I don't
seem to need help, it is because I hav a beter frend, eeven than
faather, to cumfort and sustaen me. Mi chield, th trubls and temptaeshons
of yuur lief ar begining, and mae be meny; but U can
oevercum and outliv them all if U lurn to feel th strength and
tenderness of yuur Hevenly Faather as U do that of yuur urthly
<span class="pagenum2">103</span>
wun. Th mor U luv and trust Him, th neerer U wil feel to
Him, and th les U wil depend on hueman power and wizdom.
His luv and caer never tier or chaenj, can never be taeken from U,
but mae becum th sorss of lief-long peess, hapynes, and strength.
Beleev this hartily, and go to God with all yuur litl caers, and
hoeps, and sins, and sorroes, as freely and confidingly as U cum
to yuur muther."</p>

<p>Jo's oenly anser wuz to hoeld her muther cloez, and, in th silence
which foloed, th sincerest praer she had ever praed left her hart
without wurds; for in that sad, yet hapy our, she had lurnd not
oenly th bitterness of remorss and despaer, but th sweetness of self-denieal
and self-controel; and, led by her muther's hand, she had
drawn neerer to th Frend hoo welcums every chield with a luv
strongger than that of any faather, tenderer than that of any muther.</p>

<p>Amy sturd, and sighed in her sleep; and, as if eeger to begin at
wunss to mend her fault, Jo luukt up with an expreshon on her faess
which it had never worn befor.</p>

<p>"I let th sun go doun on mi angger; I wouldn't forgiv her, and
to-dae, if it hadn't been for Laurie, it miet hav been too laet!
How cuud I be so wiked?" sed Jo, haf aloud, as she leend oever
her sister, softly stroeking th wet haer scaterd on th pilo.</p>

<p>As if she hurd, Amy oepend her ies, and held out her arms, with
a smiel that went straet to Jo's hart. Neether sed a wurd, but
thae hugd wun anuther cloez, in spiet of th blankets, and everything
wuz forgiven and forgoten in wun harty kis.</p>

<p class="h2a">MEG GOES TO VANITY Faer.</p>

<p>"I <span class="smc">do</span> think it wuz th moest forchunat thing in th wurld that thoes
children should hav th meezls just now," sed Meg, wun April dae,
as she stuud paking th "go abroady" trunk in her room, serounded
by her sisters.</p>

<p>"And so niess of Annie Moffat not to forget her promis. A hoel
fortniet of fun wil be reguelarly splendid," replied Jo, luuking liek a
windmil, as she foelded scurts with her long arms.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">105</span>
"And such luvly wether; I'm so glad of that," aded Beth,
tidily sorting nek and haer ribons in her best box, lent for th graet
ocaezhon.</p>

<p>"I wish I wuz going to hav a fien tiem, and waer all thees niess
things," sed Amy, with her mouth fuul of pins, as she artistikaly
replenisht her sister's cuushon.</p>

<p>"I wish U wer all going; but, as U can't, I shal keep mi
advenchers to tel U when I cum bak. I'm shuur it's th leest
I can do, when U hav been so kiend, lending me things, and helping
me get redy," sed Meg, glansing round th room at th verry
simpl outfit, which seemd neerly perfect in thaer ies.</p>

<p>"Whut did muther giv U out of th treasure-box?" askt Amy,
hoo had not been prezent at th oepening of a surten seedar chest,
in which Mrs. March kept a fue reliks of past splendor, as gifts for
her gurls when th proper tiem caem.</p>

<p>"A paer of silk stokings, that prity carvd fan, and a luvly bloo
sash. I wontedw th vieolet silk; but thaer isn't tiem to maek it oever,
so I must be contented with mi oeld tarlatan."</p>

<p>"It wil luuk niesly oever mi nue muzlin scurt, and th sash wil set
it off beautifully. I wish I hadn't smashed mi coral braeslet, for U
miet hav had it," sed Jo, hoo luvd to giv and lend, but hoos
possessions wer uezhualy too dilapidaeted to be of much uez.</p>

<p>"Thaer is a luvly oeld-fashond pearl set in th treasure-box; but
muther sed reeal flowers wer th prityest ornament for a yung gurl,
and Laurie promist to send me all I wont," replied Meg. "Now,
let me see; thaer's mi nue grae wauking-suit—just curl up th
fether in mi hat, Beth,—then mi poplin, for Sunday, and th small
party,—it luuks hevy for spring, doesn't it? Th vieolet silk wuud
be so niess; o, deer!"</p>

<p>"Never miend; U've got th tarlatan for th big party, and U
aulwaes luuk liek an aenjel in whiet," sed Amy, brooding oever th litl
stor of fienery in which her soel delieted.</p>

<p>"It isn't loe-nekt, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it wil hav
to do. Mi bloo hous-dres luuks so wel, turnd and freshly
trimmed, that I feel as if I'd got a nue wun. Mi silk sacque isn't a
bit th fashon, and mi bonnet doesn't luuk liek Sallie's; I didn't
<span class="pagenum2">106</span>
liek to sae anything, but I wuz sadly disapointed in mi umbrela.
I toeld muther blak, with a whiet handl, but she forgot, and bought
a green wun, with a yeloeish handl. It's strong and neet, so I
aut not to complaen, but I noe I shal feel ashamed of it besied
Annie's silk wun with a goeld top," sighed Meg, survaeing th litl
umbrela with graet disfaevor.</p>

<p>"Chaenj it," advised Jo.</p>

<p>"I wun't be so sily, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she tuuk so
much paens to get mi things. It's a nonsensikal noeshon of mien, and
I'm not going to giv up to it. Mi silk stokings and too paers of
nue gluvs ar mi cumfort. U ar a deer, to lend me yuurs, Jo.
I feel so rich, and sort of elegant, with too nue paers, and th oeld
wuns cleend up for common;" and Meg tuuk a refreshing peep at
her gluv-box.</p>

<p>"Annie Moffat has bloo and pink bows on her niet-caps; wuud
U put sum on mien?" she askt, as Beth brought up a piel of
snoey muzlins, fresh from Hannah's hands.</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't; for th smart caps wun't mach th plaen gouns,
without any trimming on them. Puur foeks shouldn't rig," sed Jo
decidedly.</p>

<p>"I wunder if I shal <em>ever</em> be hapy enough to hav reeal laess on mi
cloeths, and bows on mi caps?" sed Meg impaeshently.</p>

<p>"U sed th uther dae that U'd be perfectly hapy if U cuud
oenly go to Annie Moffat's," obzurvd Beth, in her qieet wae.</p>

<p>"So I did! Wel, I <em>am</em> hapy, and I <em>wun't</em> fret; but it duz
seem as if th mor wun gets th mor wun wonts, doesn't it? Thaer,
now, th traes ar redy, and everything in but mi baul-dres, which
I shal leev for muther to pak," sed Meg, cheering up, as she
glanst from th haf-fild trunk to th meny-times prest and
mended whiet tarlatan, which she called her "baul-dres," with an
important aer.</p>

<p>Th next dae wuz fien, and Meg departed, in stiel, for a fortniet
of novelty and plezher. Mrs. March had consented to th vizit
rather reluktantly, feering that Margaret wuud cum bak mor discontented
than she went. But she had begd so hard, and Sallie
had promist to taek guud caer of her, and a litl plezher seemd
<span class="pagenum2">107</span>
so delietful after a winter of urksum wurk, that th muther yeelded,
and th dauter went to taek her furst taest of fashonabl lief.</p>

<p>Th Moffats <em>wer</em> verry fashonabl, and simpl Meg wuz rather
daunted, at furst, by th splendor of th hous and th eleganss of
its ocuepants. But thae wer kiendly peepl, in spiet of th frivolus
lief thae led, and soon put thaer guessed at her eez. Perhaps Meg felt,
without understanding whi, that thae wer not particularly cultivaeted
or intelijent peepl, and that all thaer gilding cuud not qiet conceal
th ordinaery mateerial of which thae wer maed. It surtenly wuz
agreeabl to faer sumptuously, driev in a fien carrej, waer her best
frok every dae, and do nuthing but enjoy herself. It suited her
exaktly; and soon she began to imitaet th maners and conversation
of thoes about her; to put on litl aers and graeses, uez French
phrases, crimp her haer, taek in her dreses, and tauk about th fashons
as wel as she cuud. Th mor she saw of Annie Moffat's prity
things, th mor she envied her, and sighed to be rich. Hoem now
luukt baer and dizmal as she thaut of it, wurk groo harder than
ever, and she felt that she wuz a verry destitoot and much-injerd gurl,
in spiet of th nue gluvs and silk stokings.</p>

<p>She had not much tiem for repiening, however, for th three yung
gurls wer busily employed in "having a guud tiem." Thae shopt,
waukt, roed, and called all dae; went to theeaters and operas, or
frolikt at hoem in th evening; for Annie had meny frends, and
knew how to entertain them. Her oelder sisters wer verry fien yung
laedys, and wun wuz engaejd, which wuz extreemly interesting and
roemantik, Meg thaut. Mr. Moffat wuz a fat, joly oeld jentlman,
hoo knew her faather; and Mrs. Moffat, a fat, joly oeld laedy, hoo tuuk
as graet a fansy to Meg as her dauter had dun. Every wun peted
her; and "Daezy," as thae called her, wuz in a faer wae to hav her
hed turnd.</p>

<p>When th evening for th "small party" caem, she found that th
poplin wouldn't do at all, for th uther gurls wer putting on thin
dreses, and maeking themselvs verry fien indeed; so out caem th
tarlatan, luuking oelder, limper, and shabbier than ever besied Sallie's
crisp nue wun. Meg saw th gurls glanss at it and then at wun anuther,
and her cheeks began to burn, for, with all her jentlnes, she
<span class="pagenum2">108</span>
wuz verry proud. No wun sed a wurd about it, but Sallie oferd to
dres her haer, and Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, th engaejd
sister, praezd her whiet arms; but in thaer kiendnes Meg saw oenly
pity for her poverty, and her hart felt verry hevy as she stuud by
herself, whiel th others laft, chaterd, and floo about liek
gauzy butterflies. Th hard, biter feeling wuz geting prity bad,
when th maed brought in a box of flowers. Befor she cuud speek,
Annie had th cuver off, and all wer exclaeming at th luvly roezes,
heeth, and furn within.</p>

<p>"It's for Belle, of corss; George aulwaes sends her sum, but thees
ar aultogether ravishing," cried Annie, with a graet snif.</p>

<p>"Thae ar for Mis March, th man sed. And heer's a noet,"
put in th maed, hoelding it to Meg.</p>

<p>"Whut fun! Hoo ar thae from? Didn't noe U had a
luver," cried th gurls, fluttering about Meg in a hie staet of cueriosity
and serpriez.</p>

<p>"Th noet is from muther, and th flowers from Laurie," sed Meg
simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgoten her.</p>

<p>"O, indeed!" sed Annie, with a funy luuk, as Meg slipt
th noet into her poket, as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity,
and faulss pride; for th fue luving wurds had dun her guud, and
th flowers cheerd her up by thaer buety.</p>

<p>Feeling aulmoest hapy again, she laed by a fue furns and roezes for
herself, and qikly maed up th rest in dainty bouquets for th
breasts, haer, or scurts of her frends, ofering them so pritily that
Clara, th elder sister, toeld her she wuz "th sweetest litl thing she
ever saw;" and thae luukt qiet charmd with her small atenshon.
Sumhow th kiend akt finisht her despondensy; and when all th
rest went to sho themselvs to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a hapy, briet-ied
faess in th miror, as she laed her furns against her ripling haer,
and fasend th roezes in th dres that didn't striek her as so <em>verry</em>
shaby now.</p>

<p>She enjoyd herself verry much that evening, for she danst to her
hart's content; every wun wuz verry kiend, and she had three compliments.
Annie maed her sing, and sum wun sed she had a remarkably
fien vois; Maejor Lincoln askt hoo "th fresh litl gurl, with
<span class="pagenum2">109</span>
th buetiful ies," wuz; and Mr. Moffat insisted on dansing with
her, because she "didn't daudl, but had sum spring in her," as he
graesfuly exprest it. So, aultogether, she had a verry niess tiem, till
she oeverhurd a bit of a conversation, which disturbs her extreemly.
She wuz sitting just insied th conservatory, waeting for her partner
to bring her an iess, when she hurd a vois ask, on th uther sied of
th flowery waul,—</p>

<p>"How oeld is he?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen or seventeen, I should sae," replied anuther vois.</p>

<p>"It wuud be a grand thing for wun of thoes gurls, wouldn't it?
Sallie sez thae ar verry intimat now, and th oeld man qiet doets
<ins title="Place period after them."> 
on them."</ins></p>

<p>"Mrs M. has maed her plans, I daer sae, and wil plae her cards
wel, eerly as it is. Th gurl evidently doesn't think of it yet," sed
Mrs. Moffat.</p>

<p>"She toeld that fib about her maama, as if she did noe, and culord
up when th flowers caem, qiet pritily. Puur thing! she'd be so
niess if she wuz oenly got up in stiel. Do U think she'd be ofended
if we oferd to lend her a dres for Thursday?" 
<ins title="Place period after voice."> 
askt anuther vois.</ins></p>


<p>"She's proud, but I don't beleev she'd miend, for that dowdy tarlatan
is all she has got. She mae teer it to-niet, and that wil be a
guud excuez for ofering a deesent wun."</p>

<p>"We'll see. I shal ask yung Laurence, as a compliment to her,
and we'll hav fun about it afterward."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 437px;">

</div>

<p>Heer Meg's partner apeerd, to fiend her luuking much flusht
and rather ajitaeted. She <em>wuz</em> proud, and her pride wuz uesful just
then, for it helpt her hied her mortificaeshon, angger, and disgust at
whut she had just hurd; for, inosent and unsuspicious as she wuz,
she cuud not help understanding th gosip of her frends. She tried
to forget it, but cuud not, and kept repeeting to herself, "Mrs. M. has
maed her plans," "that fib about her maama," and "dowdy tarlatan,"
till she wuz redy to cri, and rush hoem to tel her trubls and ask
for advice. As that wuz imposibl, she did her best to seem gae;
and, being rather exsieted, she succeeded so wel that no wun dreemd
whut an efort she wuz maeking. She wuz verry glad when it wuz all
oever, and she wuz qieet in her bed, whaer she cuud think and wunder
<span class="pagenum2">110</span>
and fume till her hed aekt and her hot cheeks wer coold
by a fue nacheral teers. Thoes foolish, yet wel-ment wurds, had
oepend a nue wurld to Meg, and much disturbs th peess of th
oeld wun, in which, till now, she had livd as hapily as a chield. Her
inosent frendship with Laurie wuz spoilt by th sily speeches she
had oeverhurd; her faeth in her muther wuz a litl shaeken by th
wurldly plans atribueted to her by Mrs. Moffat, hoo jujd others
by herself; and th sensibl rezolooshon to be contented with th
simpl wardrobe which suited a puur man's dauter, wuz weekend
by th unnesesaery pity of gurls hoo thaut a shaby dres wun of
th graetest calamities under heven.</p>

<p>Puur Meg had a restles niet, and got up hevy-ied, unhapy,
haf rezentful tord her frends, and haf ashamed of herself for not
speeking out frankly, and setting everything riet. Everybody dawdled
<span class="pagenum2">111</span>
that morning, and it wuz noon befor th gurls found enerjy
enough eeven to taek up thaer wuusted wurk. Sumthing in th maner
of her frends struk Meg at wunss; thae treated her with mor
respekt, she thaut; tuuk qiet a tender interest in whut she sed,
and luukt at her with ies that plainly betraed cueriosity. All this
serpriezd and flaterd her, tho she did not understand it till
Mis Belle luukt up from her rieting, and sed, with a sentimental
aer,—</p>

<p>"Daezy, deer, I've sent an invitaeshon to yuur frend, Mr. Laurence,
for Thursday. We should liek to noe him, and it's oenly a proper
compliment to U."</p>

<p>Meg culord, but a mischivus fansy to teez th gurls maed her
replie demurely,—</p>

<p>"U ar verry kiend, but I'm afraed he wun't cum."</p>

<p>"Whi not, <i>chérie</i>?" askt Mis Belle.</p>

<p>"He's too oeld."</p>

<p>"Mi chield, whut do U meen? Whut is his aej, I beg to noe!"
cried Mis Clara.</p>

<p>"Neerly seventy, I beleev," anserd Meg, counting stitches, to
hied th merriment in her ies.</p>

<p>"U sli creecher! Of corss we ment th yung man," exclaemd
Mis Belle, lafing.</p>

<p>"Thaer isn't any; Laurie is oenly a litl boy," and Meg laft
aulso at th qeer luuk which th sisters exchanged as she thus descriebd
her supoezd luver.</p>

<p>"About yuur aej," Nan sed.</p>

<p>"Neerer mi sister Jo's; <em>I</em> am seventeen in August," returnd Meg,
tosing her hed.</p>

<p>"It's verry niess of him to send U flowers, isn't it?" sed Annie,
luuking wiez about nuthing.</p>

<p>"Yes, he ofen duz, to all of us; for thaer hous is fuul, and we
ar so fond of them. Mi muther and oeld Mr. Laurence ar frends,
U noe, so it is qiet nacheral that we children should plae together;"
and Meg hoept thae wuud sae no mor.</p>

<p>"It's evident Daezy isn't out yet," sed Mis Clara to Belle, with
a nod.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">112</span>
"Qiet a pastoral staet of inosenss all round," returnd Mis
Belle, with a shrug.</p>

<p>"I'm going out to get sum litl maters for mi gurls; can I do
anything for U, yung laedys?" askt Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in,
liek an elefant, in silk and laess.</p>

<p>"No, thank U, maa'am," replied Sallie. "I've got mi nue pink
silk for Thursday, and don't wont a thing."</p>

<p>"Nor I,—" began Meg, but stopt, because it ocurd to her
that she <em>did</em> wont several things, and cuud not hav them.</p>

<p>"Whut shal U waer?" askt Sallie.</p>

<p>"Mi oeld whiet wun again, if I can mend it fit to be seen; it got
sadly torn last niet," sed Meg, trieing to speek qiet eezily, but feeling
verry uncumfortabl.</p>

<p>"Whi don't U send hoem for anuther?" sed Sallie, hoo wuz not
an obzurving yung laedy.</p>

<p>"I haeven't got any uther." It cost Meg an efort to sae that, but
Sallie did not see it, and exclaemd, in aemiabl serpriez,—</p>

<p>"Oenly that? How funy—" She did not finish her speech, for
Belle shuuk her hed at her, and broek in, saeing kiendly,—</p>

<p>"Not at all; whaer is th uez of having a lot of dreses when she
isn't out? Thaer's no need of sending hoem, Daezy, eeven if U
had a duzen, for I've got a sweet bloo silk laed away, which I've outgroen,
and U shal waer it, to pleez me, wun't U, deer?"</p>

<p>"U ar verry kiend, but I don't miend mi oeld dres, 
<ins title="Change colon after dont to semicolon."> 
if U don't;</ins>
it duz wel enough for a litl gurl liek me," sed Meg.</p>

<p>"Now do let me pleez mieself by dresing U up in stiel. I
admier to do it, and U'd be a reguelar litl buety, with a tuch
heer and thaer. I sha'n't let any wun see U till U ar dun, and
then we'll burst upon them liek Cinderella and her godmuther, going
to th baul," sed Belle, in her persuasive toen.</p>

<p>Meg couldn't refuez th ofer so kiendly maed, for a dezier to see
if she wuud be "a litl buety" after tuching up, cauzd her to
accept, and forget all her former uncumfortabl feelings tords' th
Moffats.</p>

<p>On th Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maed;
and, between them, thae turnd Meg into a fien laedy. Thae crimpt
<span class="pagenum2">113</span>
and curld her haer, thae polished her nek and arms with sum
fraegrant pouder, tucht her lips with coralline sav, to maek them
reder, and Hortense wuud hav aded "a <i>soopçon</i> of roozh," if
Meg had not rebeld. Thae laest her into a ski-bloo dres, which
wuz so tight she cuud hardly breeth, and so loe in th nek that
modest Meg blushed at herself in th miror. A set of silver filagree
wuz aded, braeslets, neklas, brooch, and eeven eer-rings, for
Hortense tied them on, with a bit of pink silk, which did not sho.
A cluster of tee-roezbuds at th bosom, and a <i>ruche</i>, reconsield Meg
to th displae of her prity whiet shoulders, and a paer of hie-heeld
bloo silk boots satisfied th last wish of her hart. A laest hankerchif,
a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a silver hoelder finisht her
off; and Mis Belle survaed her with th satisfakshon of a litl gurl
with a nuely drest dol.</p>

<p>"Mademezel is charmante, très jolie, is she not?" cried Hortense,
clasping her hands in an affected rapcher.</p>

<p>"Cum and sho yuurself," sed Mis Belle, leeding th wae to th
room whaer th others wer waeting.</p>

<p>As Meg went rusling after, with her long scurts traeling, her eer-rings
tinkling, her curls waeving, and her hart beeting, she felt as if
her "fun" had reealy begun at last, for th miror had plainly toeld
her that she <em>wuz</em> "a litl buety." Her frends repeeted th pleezing
phrase enthusiastically; and, for several minits, she stuud, liek th
jackdaw in th faebl, enjoying her borrowed plumes, whiel th rest
chaterd liek a party of magpies.</p>

<p>"Whiel I dres, do U dril her, Nan, in th manejment of her
scurt, and thoes French heels, or she wil trip herself up. Taek yuur
silver butterfly, and cach up that long curl on th left sied of her
hed, Clara, and don't any of U disturb th charming wurk of mi
hands," sed Belle, as she huryd away, luuking wel pleezd with her
success.</p>

<p>"I'm afraed to go doun, I feel so qeer and stif and haf-drest,"
sed Meg to Sallie, as th bel rang, and Mrs. Moffat sent to ask th
yung laedys to apeer at wunss.</p>

<p>"U don't luuk a bit liek yuurself, but U ar verry niess. I'm
no-whaer besied U, for Belle has heeps of taest, and U're qiet
<span class="pagenum2">114</span>
French, I ashuur U. Let yuur flowers hang; don't be so careful
of them, and be shuur U don't trip," returnd Sallie, trieing not to
caer that Meg wuz prityer than herself.</p>

<p>Keeping that worning carefully in miend, Margaret got saefly doun
staers, and saeld into th drawing-rooms, whaer th Moffats and a
fue eerly guests wer asembld. She verry soon discuverd that
thaer is a charm about fien cloeths which atrakts a surten clas of
peepl, and secuers thaer respekt. Several yung laedys, hoo had
taeken no noetis of her befor, wer verry affectionate all of a suden;
several yung jentlmen, hoo had oenly staerd at her at th uther
party, now not oenly staerd, but askt to be introduest, and sed all
maner of foolish but agreeabl things to her; and several oeld laedys,
hoo sat on soefas, and criticised th rest of th party, inqierd hoo
she wuz, with an aer of interest. She hurd Mrs. Moffat replie to wun
of them,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">115</span>
"Daezy March—faather a colonel in th army—wun of our furst
familys, but revurses of forchun, U noe; intimat frends of th
Laurences; sweet creecher, I ashuur U; mi Ned is qiet wield about
her."</p>

<p>"Deer me!" sed th oeld laedy, putting up her glas for anuther
obzervaeshon of Meg, hoo tried to luuk as if she had not hurd, and
been rather shokt at Mrs. Moffat's fibs.</p>

<p>Th "qeer feeling" did not pas away, but she imajind herself
akting th nue part of fien laedy, and so got on prity wel, tho th
tight dres gaev her a sied-aek, th traen kept geting under her feet,
and she wuz in constant feer lest her eer-rings should fli off, and get
lost or broeken. She wuz flurting her fan and lafing at th feebl
joeks of a yung jentlman hoo tried to be wity, when she sudenly
stopt lafing and luukt confuezd; for, just opozit, she saw
Laurie. He wuz staering at her with undisgiezd serpriez, and disaprooval
aulso, she thaut; for, tho he bowd and smield, yet
sumthing in his onest ies maed her blush, and wish she had her
oeld dres on. To complete her confuezhon, she saw Belle nuj
Annie, and boeth glanss from her to Laurie, hoo, she wuz hapy to
see, luukt unuezhualy boyish and shi.</p>

<p>"Sily creechers, to put such thoughts into mi hed! I wun't caer
for it, or let it chaenj me a bit," thaut Meg, and rusld acros th
room to shaek hands with her frend.</p>

<p>"I'm glad U caem, I wuz afraed U wouldn't," she sed, with
her moest groen-up aer.</p>

<p>"Jo wontedw me to cum, and tel her how U luukt, so I did;"
anserd Laurie, without turning his ies upon her, tho he haf
smield at her maturnal toen.</p>

<p>"Whut shal U tel her?" askt Meg, fuul of cueriosity to noe
his opinyon of her, yet feeling il at eez with him, for th furst tiem.</p>

<p>"I shal sae I didn't noe U; for U luuk so groen-up, and
unliek yuurself, I'm qiet afraed of U," he sed, fumbling at his
gluv-buton.</p>

<p>"How absurd of U! Th gurls drest me up for fun, and I rather
liek it. Wouldn't Jo staer if she saw me?" sed Meg, bent on
maeking him sae whether he thaut her improovd or not.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">116</span>
"Yes, I think she wuud," returnd Laurie gravely.</p>

<p>"Don't U liek me so?" askt Meg.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," wuz th blunt replie.</p>

<p>"Whi not?" in an anxious toen.</p>

<p>He glanst at her frizld hed, baer shoulders, and fantastikaly
trimmed dres, with an expreshon that abasht her mor than his
anser, which had not a partikl of his uezhual polietnes about it.</p>

<p>"I don't liek fus and fethers."</p>

<p>That wuz aultogether too much from a lad yungger than herself; and
Meg waukt away, saeing petulantly,—</p>

<p>"U ar th rudest boy I ever saw."</p>

<p>Feeling verry much rufld, she went and stuud at a qieet windo,
to cool her cheeks, for th tight dres gaev her an uncumfortably
brilliant culor. As she stuud thaer, Maejor Lincoln past by; and,
a mienuet after, she hurd him saeing to his muther,—</p>

<p>"Thae ar maeking a fool of that litl gurl; I wontedw U to see
her, but thae hav spoilt her entierly; she's nuthing but a dol,
to-niet."</p>

<p>"O, deer!" sighed Meg; "I wish I'd been sensibl, and worn
mi oen things; then I should not hav disgusted uther peepl, or
felt so uncumfortabl and ashamed mieself."</p>

<p>She leend her forhed on th cool pane, and stuud haf hiden
by th curtens, never miending that her faevorit waults had begun, till
sum wun tucht her; and, turning, she saw Laurie, luuking penitent,
as he sed, with his verry best boe, and his hand out,—</p>

<p>"Pleez forgiv mi roodnes, and cum and danss with me."</p>

<p>"I'm afraed it wil be too disagreeabl to U," sed Meg, trieing to
luuk ofended, and faeling entierly.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it; I'm dieing to do it. Cum, I'll be guud; I
don't liek yuur goun, but I do think U ar—just splendid;" and
he waevd his hands, as if wurds faeld to expres his admeraeshon.</p>

<p>Meg smield and relented, and whisperd, as thae stuud waeting to
cach th tiem,—</p>

<p>"Taek caer mi scurt don't trip U up; it's th plaeg of mi lief,
and I wuz a gooss to waer it."</p>

<p>"Pin it round yuur nek, and then it wil be uesful," sed Laurie,
<span class="pagenum2">117</span>
luuking doun at th litl bloo boots, which he evidently aproovd
of.</p>

<p>Away thae went, fleetly and graesfuly; for, having practised at
hoem, thae wer wel macht, and th blithe yung cupl wer a
plezant siet to see, as thae twirled merrily round and round, feeling
mor frendly than ever after thaer small tiff.</p>

<p>"Laurie, I wont U to do me a faevor; wil U?" sed Meg, as
he stuud faning her, when her breth gaev out, which it did verry
soon, tho she wuud not oen whi.</p>

<p>"Wun't I!" sed Laurie, with alacrity.</p>

<p>"Pleez don't tel them at hoem about mi dres to-niet. Thae
wun't understand th joek, and it wil wury muther."</p>

<p>"Then whi did U do it?" sed Laurie's ies, so plainly that
Meg haestily aded,—</p>

<p>"I shal tel them, mieself, all about it, and ''fes' to muther how
sily I've been. But I'd rather do it mieself; so U'll not tel, wil
U?"</p>

<p>"I giv U mi wurd I wun't; oenly whut shal I sae when thae ask
me?"</p>

<p>"Just sae I luukt prity wel, and wuz having a guud tiem."</p>

<p>"I'll sae th furst, with all mi hart; but how about th uther?
U don't luuk as if U wer having a guud tiem; ar U?" and
Laurie luukt at her with an expreshon which maed her anser, in a
whisper,—</p>

<p>"No; not just now. Don't think I'm horrid; I oenly wontedw a
litl fun, but this sort doesn't pae, I fiend, and I'm geting tierd
of it."</p>

<p>"Heer cums Ned Moffat; whut duz he wont?" sed Laurie,
niting his blak brows, as if he did not regard his yung hoest in th
liet of a plezant adishon to th party.</p>

<p>"He put his naem doun for three danses, and I supoez he's
cuming for them. Whut a bor!" sed Meg, asueming a langgwid aer,
which amuezd Laurie imensly.</p>

<p>He did not speek to her again till super-tiem, when he saw her
drinking shampaen with Ned and his frend Fisher, hoo wer
behaeving "liek a paer of fools," as Laurie sed to himself, for he felt
<span class="pagenum2">118</span>
a brutherly sort of riet to woch oever th Marches, and fiet thaer
batls whenever a defender wuz needed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p>"U'll hav a spliting hedaek to-morro, if U drink much of
that. I wouldn't Meg; yuur muther doesn't liek it, U noe," he
whisperd, leening oever her chaer, as Ned turnd to refil her glas,
and Fisher stoopt to pik up her fan.</p>

<p>"I'm not Meg, to-niet; I'm 'a dol,' hoo duz all sorts of craezy
things. To-morro I shal put away mi 'fus and fethers,' and be
desperatly guud again," she anserd, with an affected litl laf.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">119</span>
"Wish to-morro wuz heer, then," muterd Laurie, wauking off,
il-pleezd at th chaenj he saw in her.</p>

<p>Meg danst and flurted, chaterd and gigld, as th uther gurls
did; after super she undertuuk th German, and blunderd thru
it, neerly upseting her partner with her long scurt, and romping in a
wae that scandalized Laurie, hoo luukt on and meditaeted a lecture.
But he got no chanss to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till
he caem to sae guud-niet.</p>

<p>"Remember!" she sed, trieing to smiel, for th spliting hedaek
had aulredy begun.</p>

<p>"Silence à laa mort," replied Laurie, with a melodramatik flurish,
as he went away.</p>

<p>This litl bit of by-plae exsieted Annie's cueriosity; but Meg wuz
too tierd for gosip, and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a
maskeraed, and hadn't enjoyd herself as much as she expected.
She wuz sik all th next dae, and on Saturday went hoem, qiet uezd
up with her fortniet's fun, and feeling that she had "sat in th lap
of lukshery" long enough.</p>

<p>"It duz seem plezant to be qieet, and not hav company
maners on all th tiem. Hoem <em>is</em> a niess plaess, tho it isn't
splendid," sed Meg, luuking about her with a restful expreshon, as
she sat with her muther and Jo on th Sunday evening.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to heer U sae so, deer, for I wuz afraed hoem wuud
seem dul and puur to U, after yuur fien qorters," replied her
muther, hoo had given her meny anxious luuks that dae; for mutherly
ies ar qik to see any chaenj in children's faeses.</p>

<p>Meg had toeld her advenchers gaely, and sed oever and oever whut
a charming tiem she had had; but sumthing still seemd to wae
upon her spirits, and, when th yungger gurls wer gon to bed, she
sat thautfuly staering at th fier, saeing litl, and luuking wuryd.
As th clok struk nien, and Jo propoezd bed, Meg sudenly left
her chaer, and, taeking Beth's stool, leend her elboes on her muther's
nee, saeing bravely,—</p>

<p>"Marmee, I wont to ''fes.'"</p>

<p>"I thaut so; whut is it, deer?"</p>

<p>"Shal I go away?" askt Jo discreetly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">120</span>
"Of corss not; don't I aulwaes tel U everything? I wuz
ashamed to speek of it befor th children, but I wont U to noe
all th dredful things I did at th Moffat's."</p>

<p>"We ar prepaerd," sed Mrs. March, smieling, but luuking a litl
anxious.</p>

<p>"I toeld U thae drest me up, but I didn't tel U that thae
pouderd and sqeezd and frizld, and maed me luuk liek a
fashon-plaet. Laurie thaut I wasn't proper; I noe he did,
tho he didn't sae so, and wun man called me 'a dol.' I knew it
wuz sily, but thae flaterd me, and sed I wuz a buety, and qontitys
of nonsenss, so I let them maek a fool of me."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" askt Jo, as Mrs. March luukt silently at th
douncast faess of her prity dauter, and cuud not fiend it in her
hart to blaem her litl folys.</p>

<p>"No; I drank shampaen and rompt and tried to flurt, and wuz
aultogether abominabl," sed Meg self-reproechfuly.</p>

<p>"Thaer is sumthing mor, I think;" and Mrs. March smoothd
th soft cheek, which sudenly groo roezy, as Meg anserd sloely,—</p>

<p>"Yes; it's verry sily, but I wont to tel it, because I haet to hav
peepl sae and think such things about us and Laurie."</p>

<p>Then she toeld th vaerius bits of gosip she had hurd at th
Moffats; and, as she spoek, Jo saw her muther foeld her lips tightly,
as if il pleezd that such iedeeas should be put into Meg's inosent
miend.</p>

<p>"Wel, if that isn't th graetest rubish I ever hurd," cried Jo
indignantly. "Whi didn't U pop out and tel them so, on th
spot?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't, it wuz so embarrassing for me. I couldn't help heering,
at furst, and then I wuz so anggry and ashamed, I didn't remember
that I aut to go away."</p>

<p>"Just waet till <em>I</em> see Annie Moffat, and I'll sho U how to setl
such ridicuelus stuf. Th iedeea of having 'plans,' and being kiend to
Laurie, because he's rich, and mae marry us by and by! Wun't he
shout, when I tel him whut thoes sily things sae about us puur
children?" and Jo laft, as if, on second thoughts, th thing
struk her as a guud joek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">121</span>
"If U tel Laurie, I'll never forgiv U! She mustn't, must
she, muther?" sed Meg, luuking distressed.</p>

<p>"No; never repeet that foolish gosip, and forget it as soon as U
can," sed Mrs. March gravely. "I wuz verry unwiez to let U go
amung peepl of hoom I noe so litl,—kiend, I daer sae, but
wurldly, il-bred, and fuul of thees vulgar iedeeas about yung peepl.
I am mor sorry than I can expres for th mischif this vizit mae
hav dun U, Meg."</p>

<p>"Don't be sorry, I wun't let it hurt me; I'll forget all th bad, and
remember oenly th guud; for I did enjoy a graet deel, and thank
U verry much for leting me go. I'll not be sentimental or dissatisfied,
muther; I noe I'm a sily litl gurl, and I'll stae with U
till I'm fit to taek caer of mieself. But it <em>is</em> niess to be praezd and
admierd, and I can't help saeing I liek it," sed Meg, luuking haf
ashamed of th confeshon.</p>

<p>"That is perfectly nacheral, and qiet harmles, if th lieking duz
not becum a pashon, and leed wun to do foolish or unmaidenly
things. Lurn to noe and value th praez which is wurth having,
and to exsiet th admeraeshon of exselent peepl by being modest as
wel as prity, Meg."</p>

<p>Margaret sat thinking a moement, whiel Jo stuud with her hands
behind her, luuking boeth interested and a litl perplexed; for it wuz
a nue thing to see Meg blushing and tauking about admeraeshon, luvers,
and things of that sort; and Jo felt as if, duuring that fortniet, her
sister had groen up amaezingly, and wuz drifting away from her into
a wurld whaer she cuud not folo.</p>

<p>"Muther, do U hav 'plans,' as Mrs. Moffat sed?" askt Meg
bashfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, mi deer, I hav a graet meny; all muthers do, but mien
difer sumwhot from Mrs. Moffat's, I suspekt. I wil tel U sum
of them, for th tiem has cum when a wurd mae set this roemantik
litl hed and hart of yuurs riet, on a verry seerius subjekt. U ar
yung, Meg, but not too yung to understand me; and muthers' lips
ar th fittest to speek of such things to gurls liek U. Jo, yuur turn
wil cum in tiem, perhaps, so lisen to mi 'plans,' and help me carry
them out, if thae ar guud."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">122</span>
Jo went and sat on wun arm of th chaer, luuking as if she thaut
thae wer about to join in sum verry solem affair. Hoelding a hand
of eech, and woching th too yung faeses wistfuly, Mrs. March sed,
in her seerius yet cheery wae,—</p>

wer to feed "Ant Cokl-top" and her family of chiks. Beth had
oeld-fashond, fraegrant flowers in her garden,—sweet pees and mignonette,
larkspur, pinks, panzys, and southernwood, with chikweed
for th burd, and capnip for th puusys. Amy had a bower in hers,—rather
small and earwiggy, but verry prity to luuk at,—with hunysukls
and morning-glorys hanging thaer culord horns and bels in
graesful reeths all oever it; taul, whiet lilys, delicat furns, and as
meny brilliant, picturesque plants as wuud consent to blossom thaer.</p>

<p>Gardening, wauks, roes on th river, and flower-hunts employed th

themselvs th Pickwick Club. With a fue interupshons, thae had

and th weekly nuezpaeper, called "Th Pickwick Portfolio," to
which all contributed sumthing; whiel Jo, hoo reveld in pens and
ink, wuz th editor. At seven o'clok, th foer members ascended
to th club-room, tied thaer badges round thaer heds, and tuuk thaer
seets with graet solemnity. Meg, as th eldest, wuz Samuel Pickwick;
Jo, being of a literaery turn, Augustus Snodgrass; Beth, because she
wuz round and roezy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy, hoo wuz aulwaes trieing
to do whut she couldn't, wuz Nathaniel Winkle. Pickwick, th
prezident, red th paeper, which wuz fild with orijinal taels, poetry,
loekal nues, funy advertisements, and hints, in which thae guud-naturedly

<p>Gondola after gondola swept up to th

swel th brilliant throng that fild th
stately hauls of Count de Adelon. Niets
and laedys, elvs and paejes, munks and
flower-gurls, all minggld gaely in th danss.
Sweet voises and rich melody fild th aer;
and so with murth and muezik th maskeraed
went on.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">127</span>
"Has yuur Hienes seen th Laedy

of th faery qeen hoo floeted doun

<p>"Yes; is she not luvly, tho so sad!
Her dres is wel choezen, too, for in a week
she weds Count Antonio, hoom she pashonatly
haets."</p>

<p>"By mi faeth, I envy him. Yonder he

th blak mask. When that is off we shal
see how he regards th faer maed hoos
hart he cannot win, tho her sturn
faather bestoes her hand," returnd th
troobador.</p>

<p>"'Tis whisperd that she luvs th yung
English artist hoo haunts her steps, and is
spurnd by th oeld count," sed th laedy, as
thae joind th danss.</p>

<p>Th revel wuz at its hiet when a preest
apeerd, and, withdrawing th yung paer
to an alcoev hung with purpl velvet, he
moeshond them to neel. Instant silence
fel upon th gae throng; and not a sound,
but th dash of fountens or th rusl of
orenj-groevs sleeping in th moonliet,
broek th hush, as Count de Adelon spoek
thus:—</p>

<p>"Mi lords and laedys, pardon th rooz
by which I hav gatherd U heer to witnes
th marrej of mi dauter. Faather,
we waet yuur survises."</p>

<p>All ies turnd tord th briedal party,
and a loe murmer of amaezment went
thru th throng, for neether bried nor
groom remoovd thaer masks. Cueriosity and
wunder possessed all harts, but respekt restraend
all tungs till th hoely riet wuz
oever. Then th eeger spektaetors gatherd
round th count, demanding an explanaeshon.</p>

<p>"Gladly wuud I giv it if I cuud; but I
oenly noe that it wuz th whim of mi timid
Veoela, and I yeelded to it. Now, mi children,
let th plae end. Unmask, and reseev

<p>But neether bent th nee; for th yung
briedgroom replied, in a toen that startld
all liseners, as th mask fel, discloezing th
noebl faess of Ferdinand Devereux, th
artist luver; and, leening on th breast
whaer now flasht th star of an English
url, wuz th luvly Veoela, raediant with joy
and buety.</p>

<p>"Mi lord, U scornfuly bade me claem
yuur dauter when I cuud boest as hie
a naem and vast a forchun as th Count
Antonio. I can do mor; for eeven yuur
ambishus soel cannot refuez th Url of
Devereux and De Vere, when he givs his
ancient naem and boundless welth in return
for th beluved hand of this faer laedy,
now mi wief."</p>

<p>Th count stuud liek wun chaenjd to
stoen; and, turning to th bewildered croud,
Ferdinand aded, with a gae smiel of trieumf,
"To U, mi galant frends, I can
oenly wish that yuur wooing mae prosper as

as faer a bried as I hav, by this maskt

As th Prezident finisht reeding th paeper (which I beg leev to
ashuur mi reeders is a <i>bona fide</i> copy of wun riten by <i>bona fide</i> gurls
wunss upon a tiem), a round of aplauz foloed, and then Mr.
Snodgrass roez to maek a propozishon.</p>

<p>"Mr. Prezident and jentlmen," he began, asueming a parliamentary
atitued and toen, "I wish to propoez th admishon of a
nue member,—wun hoo hiely dezurvs th onor, wuud be deeply
graetful for it, and wuud ad imensly to th spirit of th club, th
literaery value of th paeper, and be no end joly and niess. I propoez
Mr. Theodore Laurence as an onoraery member of th P. C. Cum
now, do hav him."</p>

<p>Jo's suden chaenj of toen maed th gurls laf; but all luukt
rather anxious, and no wun sed a wurd, as Snodgrass tuuk his seet.</p>

<p>"We'll put it to voet," sed th Prezident. "All in faevor of this
moeshon pleez to manifest it by saeing 'Ay.'"</p>

<p>A loud responss from Snodgrass, foloed, to everybody's serpriez,
by a timid wun from Beth.</p>

<p>"Contraery miended sae 'No.'"</p>

<p>Meg and Amy wer contraery miended; and Mr. Winkle roez to sae,
with graet eleganss, "We don't wish any boys; thae oenly joek and
bounss about. This is a laedys' club, and we wish to be private and
proper."</p>

<p>"I'm afraed he'll laf at our paeper, and maek fun of us afterward,"
obzurvd Pickwick, puuling th litl curl on her forhed, as
she aulwaes did when doubtful.</p>

<p>Up roez Snodgrass, verry much in urnest. "Sur, I giv U mi
wurd as a jentlman, Laurie wun't do anything of th sort. He lieks
to riet, and he'll giv a toen to our contributions, and keep us from
being sentimental, don't U see? We can do so litl for him, and
he duz so much for us, I think th leest we can do is to ofer him a
plaess heer, and maek him welcum if he cums."</p>

<p>This artful aloozhon to benefits confurd brought Tupman to his
feet, luuking as if he had qiet maed up his miend.</p>

<p>"Yes, we aut to do it, eeven if we <em>ar</em> afraed. I sae he <em>mae</em>
cum, and his grandpa, too, if he lieks."</p>

<p>This spirited burst from Beth electrified th club, and Jo left her
<span class="pagenum2">131</span>
seet to shaek hands approvingly. "Now then, voet again. Everybody
remember it's our Laurie, and sae 'Ay!'" cried Snodgrass
exsietedly.</p>

<p>"Ay! ay! ay!" replied three voises at wunss.</p>

<p>"Guud! Bles U! Now, as thaer's nuthing liek 'taeking tiem by

oepen th dor of th clozet, and displaed Laurie sitting on a rag-bag,
flusht and twinkling with suprest lafter.</p>

<p>"U roeg! U traitor! Jo, how cuud U?" cried th three
<span class="pagenum2">132</span>
gurls, as Snodgrass led her frend triumphantly forth; and, producing
boeth a chaer and a baj, instauld him in a jiffy.</p>

<p>"Th coolness of U too rascals is amaezing," began Mr. Pickwick,
trieing to get up an auful froun, and oenly succeeding in producing an
aemiabl smiel. But th nue member wuz equal to th ocaezhon;
and, riezing, with a graetful saluetaeshon to th Chaer, sed, in th moest
engaejing maner, "Mr. Prezident and laedys,—I beg pardon,
jentlmen,—alow me to introduess mieself as Sam Weller, th verry
humbl survant of th club."</p>

<p>"Guud! guud!" cried Jo, pounding with th handl of th oeld
worming-paen on which she leend.</p>

<p>"Mi faethful frend and noebl patron," continued Laurie, with a
waev of th hand, "hoo has so flatteringly prezented me, is not to be
blaemd for th baess stratejem of to-niet. I pland it, and she
oenly gaev in after lots of teezing."</p>

<p>"Cum now, don't lae it all on yuurself; U noe I propoezd
th cubord," broek in Snodgrass, hoo wuz enjoying th joek
amaezingly.</p>

<p>"Never U miend whut she sez. I'm th rech that did it, sur,"
sed th nue member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick.
"But on mi onor, I never wil do so again, and hensforth <i>dewote</i>
mieself to th interest of this immortal club."</p>

<p>"Heer! heer!" cried Jo, clashing th lid of th worming-paen liek
a simbal.</p>

<p>"Go on, go on!" aded Winkle and Tupman, whiel th Prezident
bowd benignly.</p>

<p>"I meerly wish to sae, that as a sliet toeken of mi gratitood for

<p>Graet aplauz as Mr. Weller depozited a litl kee on th taebl,
and subsided; th worming-paen clasht and waevd wieldly, and it wuz
sum tiem befor order cuud be restord. A long discushon foloed,
and every wun caem out serpriezing, for every wun did her best;
so it wuz an unuezhualy lievly meeting, and did not ajurn till a laet
our, when it broek up with three shril cheers for th nue member.</p>

<p>No wun ever regreted th admitanss of Sam Weller, for a mor
devoeted, wel-behaevd, and joevial member no club cuud hav. He
surtenly did ad "spirit" to th meetings, and "a toen" to th
paeper; for his orations convulst his heerers, and his contributions
wer exselent, being patriotic, classical, comikal, or dramatik, but
never sentimental. Jo regarded them as wurthy of Baecon, Milton, or
Shakespeare; and remodelled her oen wurks with guud efekt, she
thaut.</p>

<p>Th P. O. wuz a capital litl institooshon, and flurisht wunderfuly,
for neerly as meny qeer things past thru it as thru th reeal

long leters, muezik and jinjerbred, rubers, invitaeshons, scoldings
and pupys. Th oeld jentlman liked th fun, and amuezd himself
by sending od bundles, misteerius mesejes, and funy telegrams;
and his gardener, hoo wuz smitten with Hannah's charms, akchualy
sent a luv-leter to Jo's caer. How thae laft when th seecret

<p class="h2a">Experriments.</p>

<p>"<span class="smc">Th</span> furst of June! Th Kings ar off to th seeshor to-morro,
and I'm free. Three munths' vaecaeshon,—how I shal enjoy it!" exclaemd
Meg, cuming hoem wun worm dae to fiend Jo laed upon th soefa
in an uenuezhual staet of exauschon, whiel Beth tuuk off her dusty boots,
and Amy maed lemonaed for th refreshment of th hoel party.</p>

<p>"Ant March went to-dae, for which, o, be joyful!" sed Jo. "I
wuz mortaly afraed she'd ask me to go with her; if she had, I should
hav felt as if I aut to do it; but Plumfield is about as gae as a
church-yard, U noe, and I'd rather be excuezd. We had a flury
geting th oeld laedy off, and I had a friet every tiem she spoek to
me, for I wuz in such a hurry to be thru that I wuz uncomonly
helpful and sweet, and feerd she'd fiend it imposibl to part from
me. I qaekt till she wuz faerly in th carrej, and had a fienal
friet, for, as it droev off, she popt out her hed, saeing, 'Josy-phine,
<span class="pagenum2">135</span>
wun't U—?' I didn't heer any mor, for I basely turnd
and fled; I did akchualy run, and whiskt round th corner, whaer I
felt saef."</p>

<p>"Puur oeld Jo! she caem in luuking as if baers wer after her,"
sed Beth, as she cudld her sister's feet with a mutherly aer.</p>

<p>"Ant March is a reguelar samphire, is she not?" obzurvd Amy,
taesting her mixcher critikaly.</p>

<p>"She means <em>vampire</em>, not see-weed; but it doesn't mater; it's
too worm to be particular about wun's parts of speech," murmerd
Jo.</p>

<p>"Whut shal U do all yuur vaecaeshon?" askt Amy, chaenjing th
subjekt, with takt.</p>

<p>"I shal lie abed laet, and do nuthing," replied Meg, from th
depths of th roking-chaer. "I've been routed up eerly all winter,
and had to spend mi daes wurking for uther peepl; so now I'm
going to rest and revel to mi hart's content."</p>

<p>"No," sed Jo; "that dozy wae wouldn't suit me. I've laed in a
heep of books, and I'm going to improov mi shiening ours reeding
on mi purch in th oeld apl-tree, when I'm not having 
l———"</p>

<p>"Don't sae 'larks!'" implord Amy, as a return snub for th
"samphire" corekshon.</p>

<p>"I'll sae 'nietinggaels,' then, with Laurie; that's proper and
aproepriat, sinss he's a worbler."</p>

<p>"Don't let us do any lesons, Beth, for a whiel, but plae all th
tiem, and rest, as th gurls meen to," propoezd Amy.</p>

<p>"Wel, I wil, if muther doesn't miend. I wont to lurn sum nue
songs, and mi children need fitting up for th sumer; thae ar
dredfuly out of order, and reealy sufering for cloeths."</p>

<p>"Mae we, muther?" askt Meg, turning to Mrs. March, hoo sat
soeing, in whut thae called "Marmee's corner."</p>

<p>"U mae tri yuur experriment for a week, and see how U liek
it. I think by Saturday niet U wil fiend that all plae and no wurk
is as bad as all wurk and no plae."</p>

<p><ins title="Ambiguous punctuation after no is an exclamation point!"> 
"O, deer, no!</ins> it wil be delicious, I'm shuur," sed Meg 
complacently.</p>

<p>"I now propoez a toest, as mi 'frend and pardner, Sairy Gamp,'
<span class="pagenum2">136</span>
sez. Fun forever, and no grubing!" cried Jo, riezing, glas in hand,
as th lemonaed went round.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p>Thae all drank it merrily, and began th experriment by lounging
for th rest of th dae. Next morning, Meg did not apeer till ten
o'clok; her solitaery brekfast did not taest niess, and th room seemd
loenly and untiedy; for Jo had not fild th vaeses, Beth had not dusted,
and Amy's books lae scaterd about. Nuthing wuz neet and plezant
but "Marmee's corner," which luukt as uezhual; and thaer Meg sat,
to "rest and red," which ment yaun, and imajin whut prity
sumer dreses she
wuud get with her
salary. Jo spent th
morning on th river,
with Laurie, and th
afternoon reeding and
crieing oever "Th
Wied, Wied Wurld,"
up in th apl-tree.
Beth began by rumejing
everything
out of th big clozet,
whaer her family rezieded;
but, geting
tierd befor haf
dun, she left her establishment
topsy-turvy,
and went to
her muezik, rejoising
that she had no dishes
to wosh. Amy araenjd
her bower,
put on her best whiet frok, smoothd her curls, and sat doun to
draw, under th hunysukls, hoeping sum wun wuud see and inqier
hoo th yung artist wuz. As no wun apeerd but an inqizitiv
dady-long-legs, hoo examind her wurk with interest, she went to
wauk, got caut in a shower, and caem hoem driping.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">137</span>
At tee-tiem thae compaerd noets, and all agreed that it had been
a delietful, tho unuezhualy long dae. Meg, hoo went shoping in
th afternoon, and got a "sweet bloo muzlin," had discuverd, after
she had cut th breadths off, that it wouldn't wosh, which mis-hap
maed her slietly cros. Jo had burnt th skin off her noez boeting,
and got a raejing hedaek by reeding too long. Beth wuz wuryd
by th confuezhon of her clozet, and th dificulty of lurning three or
foer songs at wunss; and Amy deeply regreted th damej dun her
frok, for Katy Broun's party wuz to be th next dae; and now, liek
Flora McFlimsey, she had "nuthing to waer." But thees wer meer
trifles; and thae ashuurd thaer muther that th experriment wuz wurking
fienly. She smield, sed nuthing, and, with Hannah's help, did
thaer neglekted wurk, keeping hoem plezant, and th domestik
masheenery runing smoothly. It wuz astonishing whut a peculiar
and uncumfortabl staet of things wuz produced by th "resting and
reveling" process. Th daes kept geting longer and longer; th
wether wuz unuezhualy vaeriabl, and so wer tempers; an unsetld
feeling possessed every wun, and Saetan found plenty of mischif for
th iedl hands to do. As th hiet of lukshery, Meg put out sum of
her soeing, and then found tiem hang so hevily that she fel to
sniping and spoiling her cloeths, in her atempts to furbish them up
à laa Moffat. Jo red till her ies gaev out, and she wuz sik of books;
got so fijety that eeven guud-naecherd Laurie had a qorrel with her,
and so reduest in spirits that she desperatly wisht she had gon
with Ant March. Beth got on prity wel, for she wuz constantly
forgeting that it wuz to be <em>all plae, and no wurk</em>, and fel bak into
her oeld waes now and then; but sumthing in th aer affected her,
and, mor than wunss, her tranquillity wuz much disturbs; so much
so, that, on wun ocaezhon, she akchualy shuuk puur deer Joanna, and
toeld her she wuz "a friet." Amy faerd wurst of all, for her resorses
wer small; and when her sisters left her to amuez and caer for
herself, she soon found that accomplished and important litl self a
graet burden. She didn't liek dols, faery-taels wer chieldish, and
wun couldn't draw all th tiem; tee-partys didn't amount to much,
neether did picnics, unles verry wel conducted. "If wun cuud hav
a fien hous, fuul of niess gurls, or go travelling, th sumer wuud be
<span class="pagenum2">138</span>
delietful; but to stae at hoem with three selfish sisters and a groen-up
boy wuz enough to tri th paeshenss of a Boaz," complaend Mis
Malaprop, after several daes devoeted to plezher, freting, and <i>ennui</i>.</p>

<p>No wun wuud oen that thae wer tierd of th experriment; but, by
Friday niet, eech aknolejd to herself that she wuz glad th
week wuz neerly dun. Hoeping to impres th leson mor deeply,
Mrs. March, hoo had a guud deel of huemor, rezolvd to finish off th
trieal in an aproepriat maner; so she gaev Hannah a holidae, and
let th gurls enjoy th fuul efekt of th plae system.</p>

<p>When thae got up on Saturday morning, thaer wuz no fier in th
kichen, no brekfast in th diening-room, and no muther anywhere to
be seen.</p>

<p>"Mursy on us! whut <em>has</em> happened?" cried Jo, staering about her
in dismae.</p>

<p>Meg ran upstaers, and soon caem bak again, luuking releevd, but
rather bewildered, and a litl ashamed.</p>

<p>"Muther isn't sik, oenly verry tierd, and she sez she is going to
stae qieetly in her room all dae, and let us do th best we can. It's
a verry qeer thing for her to do, she doesn't akt a bit liek herself;
but she sez it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn't grumbl,
but taek caer of ourselvs."</p>

<p>"That's eezy enough, and I liek th iedeea; I'm aeking for sumthing
to do—that is, sum nue amuezment, U noe," aded Jo
qikly.</p>

<p>In fakt it <em>wuz</em> an imenss releef to them all to hav a litl wurk,
and thae tuuk hoeld with a wil, but soon reealiezd th trooth of Hannah's
saeing, "Houskeeping ain't no joek." Thaer wuz plenty of
food in th larder, and, whiel Beth and Amy set th taebl, Meg and
Jo got brekfast, wundering, as thae did so, whi survants ever taukt
about hard wurk.</p>

<p>"I shal taek sum up to muther, tho she sed we wer not to
think of her, for she'd taek caer of herself," sed Meg, hoo prezieded,
and felt qiet maetronly behind th teepot.</p>

<p>So a trae wuz fited out befor any wun began, and taeken up, with
th cuuk's compliments. Th boild tee wuz verry biter, th omelette
scorcht, and th biskits spekld with saleratus; but Mrs. March
<span class="pagenum2">139</span>
reseevd her repast with thanks, and laft hartily oever it after Jo
wuz gon.</p>

<p>"Puur litl soels, thae wil hav a hard tiem, I'm afraed; but thae
wun't sufer, and it wil do them guud," she sed, producing th mor
palatable vieands with which she had provided herself, and dispoezing
of th bad brekfast, so that thaer feelings miet not be hurt,—a
mutherly litl desepshon, for which thae wer graetful.</p>

<p>Meny wer th complaents beloe, and graet th shagrin of th
hed cuuk at her faeluers. "Never miend, I'll get th diner, and
be survant; U be mistres, keep yuur hands niess, see company,
and giv orders," sed Jo, hoo knew still les than Meg about cuelinarry
affairs.</p>

<p>This obliejing ofer wuz gladly accepted; and Margaret retierd to
th parlor, which she haestily put in order by whisking th liter under
th soefa, and shutting th bliends, to saev th trubl of dusting. Jo,
with perfect faeth in her oen powers, and a frendly dezier to maek
up th qorrel, imeediatly put a noet in th ofis, invieting Laurie
to diner.</p>

<p>"U'd beter see whut U hav got befor U think of having
company," sed Meg, when informd of th hospitabl but rash
akt.</p>

<p>"O, thaer's corned beef and plenty of potaetoes; and I shal get
sum asparagus, and a lobster, 'for a relish,' as Hannah sez. We'll
hav letis, and maek a salad. I don't noe how, but th book tels.
I'll hav blanc-maenj and strawberrys for dezurt; and cofy, too,
if U wont to be elegant."</p>

<p>"Don't tri too meny meses, Jo, for U can't maek anything but
jinjerbred and molases candy, fit to eat. I wosh mi hands of th
diner-party; and, sinss U hav askt Laurie on yuur oen responsibility,
U mae just taek caer of him."</p>

<p>"I don't wont U to do anything but be sivil to him, and help to
th puuding. U'll giv me yuur advice if I get in a mudl, wun't
U?" askt Jo, rather hurt.</p>

<p>"Yes; but I don't noe much, exsept about bred, and a fue
trifles. U had beter ask muther's leev befor U order anything,"
returnd Meg proodently.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">140</span>
"Of corss I shal; I'm not a fool," and Jo went off in a huf at
th doubts exprest of her powers.</p>

<p>"Get whut U liek, and don't disturb me; I'm going out to
diner, and can't wury about things at hoem," sed Mrs. March,
when Jo spoek to her. "I never enjoyd houskeeping, and I'm
going to taek a vaecaeshon to-dae, and red, riet, go viziting, and amuez
mieself."</p>

<p>Th uenuezhual spektakl of her busy muther roking comfortably,
and reeding, eerly in th morning, maed Jo feel as if sum nacheral
phenomenon had ocurd, for an eclips, an urthqaek, or a volcanik
erupshon wuud hardly hav seemd straenjer.</p>

<p>"Everything is out of sorts, sumhow," she sed to herself, going
doun staers. "Thaer's Beth crieing; that's a shuur sien that sumthing
is rong with this family. If Amy is bothering, I'll shaek her."</p>

<p>Feeling verry much out of sorts herself, Jo huryd into th parlor
to fiend Beth sobing oever Pip, th canary, hoo lae ded in th caej,
with his litl claws pathetikaly extended, as if imploring th food
for wont of which he had died.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">141</span>
"It's all mi fault—I forgot him—thaer isn't a seed or a drop
left. O Pip! O Pip! how cuud I be so crooel to U?" cried
Beth, taeking th puur thing in her hands, and trieing to restor him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 466px;">

<img src="./LitlWimen_files/b058.png" width="466" height="400" alt="O Pip! O Pip!" title="O Pip! O Pip!">
</div>

<p>Jo peept into his haf-oepen ie, felt his litl hart, and fiending him
stif and coeld, shuuk her hed, and oferd her domino-box for a cofin.</p>

<p>"Put him in th oven, and maebe he wil get worm and reviev,"
sed Amy hoepfuly.</p>

<p>"He's been starvd, and he sha'n't be baekt, now he's ded.
I'll maek him a shroud, and he shal be berryd in th garden; and
I'll never hav anuther burd, never, mi Pip! for I am too bad to
oen wun," murmerd Beth, sitting on th flor with her pet foelded in
her hands.</p>

<p>"Th fueneral shal be this afternoon, and we wil all go. Now,
don't cri, Bethy; it's a pity, but nuthing goes riet this week, and
Pip has had th wurst of th experriment. Maek th shroud, and lae
him in mi box; and, after th diner-party, we'll hav a niess litl
fueneral," sed Jo, begining to feel as if she had undertaeken a guud
deel.</p>

<p>Leeving th others to consoel Beth, she departed to th kichen,
which wuz in a moest discurejing staet of confuezhon. Putting on a
big apron, she fel to wurk, and got th dishes pield up redy for
woshing, when she discuverd that th fier wuz out.</p>

<p>"Heer's a sweet prospekt!" muterd Jo, slaming th stoev-dor
oepen, and poeking vigorusly amung th cinders.</p>

<p>Having re-kindld th fier, she thaut she wuud go to market whiel
th wauter heeted. Th wauk revievd her spirits; and, flatering herself
that she had maed guud bargans, she trujd hoem again, after
buying a verry yung lobster, sum verry oeld asparagus, and too boxes
of asid strawberrys. By th tiem she got cleerd up, th diner
arrived, and th stoev wuz red-hot. Hannah had left a paen of bred
to riez, Meg had wurkt it up eerly, set it on th harth for a second
riezing, and forgoten it. Meg wuz entertaining Sallie Gardiner in th
parlor, when th dor floo oepen, and a floury, crocky, flusht, and
dishevelled figuer apeerd, demanding tartly,—</p>

<p>"I sae, isn't bred 'riz' enough when it runs oever th pans?"</p>

<p>Sallie began to laf; but Meg noded, and lifted her iebrows
<span class="pagenum2">142</span>
as hie as thae wuud go, which cauzd th apparition to vanish, and
put th sour bred into th oven without further delae. Mrs. March
went out, after peeping heer and thaer to see how maters went, aulso
saeing a wurd of cumfort to Beth, hoo sat maeking a wiending-sheet,
whiel th deer departed lae in staet in th domino-box. A straenj
senss of helplessness fel upon th gurls as th grae bonnet vanisht
round th corner; and despaer seezd them, when, a fue minits
laeter, Mis Crocker apeerd, and sed she'd cum to diner. Now,
this laedy wuz a thin, yelo spinster, with a sharp noez and inqizitiv
ies, hoo saw everything, and gosipt about all she saw. Thae disliekt
her, but had been taut to be kiend to her, simply because she
wuz oeld and puur, and had fue frends. So Meg gaev her th eezy-chaer,
and tried to entertain her, whiel she askt qeschons, criticised
everything, and toeld storys of th peepl hoom she knew.</p>

<p>Langgwej cannot descrieb th anxieties, expeeri’enses, and exertions
which Jo underwent that morning; and th diner she survd up
becaem a standing joek. Feering to ask any mor advice, she did
her best aloen, and discuverd that sumthing mor than enerjy and
guud-wil is nesesaery to maek a cuuk. She boild th asparagus for
an our, and wuz greevd to fiend th heds cuukt off and th stauks
harder than ever. Th bred burnt blak; for th salad-dresing so
aggravated her, that she let everything else go till she had convinced
herself that she cuud not maek it fit to eat. Th lobster wuz a
scarlet mistery to her, but she hamerd and poekt, till it wuz unsheld,
and its meagre proporshons concealed in a groev of letis-leevs.
Th potaetoes had to be huryd, not to keep th asparagus
waeting, and wer not dun at last. Th blanc-maenj wuz lumpy,
and th strawberrys not as riep as thae luukt, having been skilfully
"deaconed."</p>

<p>"Wel, thae can eat beef, and bred and buter, if thae ar hunggry;
oenly it's mortifying to hav to spend yuur hoel morning for nuthing,"
thaut Jo, as she rang th bel haf an our laeter than uezhual, and
stuud, hot, tierd, and dispirited, survaeing th feest spred for Laurie,
accustomed to all sorts of eleganss, and Mis Crocker, hoos cuerius
ies wuud mark all faeluers, and hoos tatling tung wuud report
them far and wied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">143</span></p>

</div>

<p>
Puur Jo wuud gladly hav gon under th taebl, as wun thing after
anuther wuz taested and left; whiel Amy gigld, Meg luukt distressed,
Mis Crocker purst up her lips, and Laurie taukt and
laft with all his miet, to giv a cheerful toen to th festiv seen.
Jo's wun strong pointer wuz th froot, for she had sugared it wel, and
had a pitcher of rich creem to eat with
it. Her hot cheeks coold a trifle, and
she droo a long breth, as th prity
glas plaets went round, and every wun
luukt graeshusly at th litl roezy ielands
floeting in a see of creem. Mis Crocker
taested furst, maed a rie faess, and drank
sum wauter haestily. Jo, hoo had refuezd,
thinking thaer miet not be
enough, for thae dwindled sadly
after th piking oever, glanst at
Laurie, but he wuz eating away
manfuly, tho thaer wuz a
sliet puker about his mouth,
and he kept his ie fixed on his
plaet. Amy, hoo wuz fond of
delicat faer, tuuk a heeping
spoonful, choekt, hid her faess in her napkin, and left th taebl
precipitately.</p>

<p>"O, whut is it?" exclaemd Jo trembling.</p>

<p>"Sault insted of sugar, and th creem is sour," replied Meg, with a
trajik jescher.</p>

<p>Jo uterd a groen, and fel bak in her chaer; remembering that
she had given a last hasty poudering to th berrys out of wun of th
too boxes on th kichen taebl, and had neglekted to put th milk in
th refrijeraetor. She turnd scarlet, and wuz on th vurj of crieing,
when she met Laurie's ies, which <em>wuud</em> luuk merry in spiet of his
heroeik eforts; th comikal sied of th affair sudenly struk her, and
she laft till th teers ran doun her cheeks. So did every wun
else, eeven "Croeker," as th gurls called th oeld laedy; and th unforchunat
diner ended gaely, with bred and buter, olivs and fun.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">144</span>
"I haeven't strength of miend enough to cleer up now, so we wil
soeber ourselvs with a fueneral," sed Jo, as thae roez; and Mis
Crocker maed redy to go, being eeger to tel th nue story at
anuther frend's diner-taebl.</p>

<p>Thae did soeber themselvs, for Beth's saek; Laurie dug a graev
under th furns in th groev, litl Pip wuz laed in, with meny teers,
by his tender-hearted mistres, and cuverd with mos, whiel a reeth
of vieolets and chikweed wuz hung on th stoen which bor his
epitaph, compoezd by Jo, whiel she strugld with th diner:—</p>


<div class="poem1 clear">
<p class="indent30 left-indent20">
   "Heer lies Pip March,</p>

<p class="indent15 left-indent20">
    And not forgoten soon."</p>
</div>


<p>At th concloozhon of th serremoenys, Beth retierd to her room,
oevercum with emotion and lobster; but thaer wuz no plaess of repoez,
for th beds wer not maed, and she found her greef much assuaged
by beeting up piloes and putting things in order. Meg helpt Jo
cleer away th remaens of th feest, which tuuk haf th afternoon,
and left them so tierd that thae agreed to be contented with tee and
toest for super. Laurie tuuk Amy to driev, which wuz a deed of
charrity, for th sour creem seemd to hav had a bad efekt upon her
temper. Mrs. March caem hoem to fiend th three oelder gurls hard
at wurk in th midl of th afternoon; and a glanss at th clozet
gaev her an iedeea of th success of wun part of th experriment.</p>

<p>Befor th houswievs cuud rest, several peepl called, and thaer
wuz a scrambl to get redy to see them; then tee must be got,
errands dun; and wun or too nesesaery bits of soeing neglekted till
th last mienuet. As twilight fel, duey and still, wun by wun thae
gatherd in th porch whaer th June roezes wer buding beautifully,
and eech groend or sighed as she sat doun, as if tierd or trubld.</p>

<p>"Whut a dredful dae this has been!" begun Jo, uezhualy th furst
to speek.</p>

<p>"It has seemd shorter than uezhual, but <em>so</em> uncumfortabl," sed
Meg.</p>

<p>"Not a bit liek hoem," aded Amy.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">145</span>
"It can't seem so without Marmee and litl Pip," sighed Beth,
glansing, with fuul ies, at th empty caej abuv her hed.</p>

<p>"Heer's muther, deer, and U shal hav anuther burd to-morro,
if U wont it."</p>

<p>As she spoek, Mrs. March caem and tuuk her plaess amung them,
luuking as if her holidae had not been much plezanter than theirs.</p>

<p>"Ar U satisfied with yuur experriment, gurls, or do U wont
anuther week of it?" she askt, as Beth nesld up to her, and th
rest turnd tord her with brietening faeses, as flowers turn tord
th sun.</p>

<p>"I don't!" cried Jo decidedly.</p>

<p>"Nor I," ecoed th others.</p>

<p>"U think, then, that it is beter to hav a fue duties, and liv a
litl for others, do U?"</p>

<p>"Lounging and larking doesn't pae," obzurvd Jo, shaeking her
hed. "I'm tierd of it, and meen to go to wurk at sumthing riet
off."</p>

<p>"Supoez U lurn plaen cuuking; that's a uesful accomplishment,
which no wuuman should be without," sed Mrs. March, lafing
inaudibly at th recolekshon of Jo's diner-party; for she had met
Mis Crocker, and hurd her account of it.</p>

<p>"Muther, did U go away and let everything be, just to see how
we'd get on?" cried Meg, hoo had had suspishons all dae.</p>

<p>"Yes; I wontedw U to see how th cumfort of all depends on
eech dooing her shaer faethfuly. Whiel Hannah and I did yuur wurk,
U got on prity wel, tho I don't think U wer verry hapy or
aemiabl; so I thaut, as a litl leson, I wuud sho U whut
happens when every wun thinks oenly of herself. Don't U feel that
it is plezanter to help wun anuther, to hav daily duties which maek
leezher sweet when it cums, and to baer and forbaer, that hoem mae
be comfortable and luvly to us all?"</p>

<p>"We do, muther, we do!" cried th gurls.</p>

<p>"Then let me advise U to taek up yuur litl burdens again; for
tho thae seem hevy sumtiems, thae ar guud for us, and lieten
as we lurn to carry them. Wurk is hoelsum, and thaer is plenty
for every wun; it keeps us from <i>ennui</i> and mischif, is guud for
<span class="pagenum2">146</span>
helth and spirits, and givs us a senss of power and independenss
beter than muny or fashon."</p>

<p>"We'll wurk liek bees, and luv it too; see if we don't!" sed
Jo. "I'll lurn plaen cuuking for mi holidae task; and th next
diner-party I hav shal be a success."</p>

<p>"I'll maek th set of shurts for faather, insted of leting U do it,
Marmee. I can and I wil, tho I'm not fond of soeing; that
wil be beter than fusing oever mi oen things, which ar plenty niess
enough as thae ar," sed Meg.</p>

<p>"I'll do mi lesons every dae, and not spend so much tiem with
mi muezik and dols. I am a stoopid thing, and aut to be studying,
not plaeing," wuz Beth's rezolooshon; whiel Amy foloed thaer exampl
by heroeikaly declaering, "I shal lurn to maek 
<ins title="Change buttonholes to button-holes."> 
buton-hoels,</ins>
and atend to mi parts of speech."</p>

<p>"Verry guud! then I am qiet satisfied with th experriment, and
fansy that we shal not hav to repeet it; oenly don't go to th uther
extreem, and delv liek slaevs. Hav reguelar ours for wurk and
plae; maek eech dae boeth uesful and plezant, and proov that U
understand th wurth of tiem by employing it wel. Then yooth wil
be delietful, oeld aej wil bring fue regrets, and lief becum a buetiful
success, in spiet of poverty."</p>

<p>"We'll remember, muther!" and thae did.</p>

dae she caem in with her hands
fuul, and went about th hous
leeving leters and parsels, liek
th peny poest.</p>

<p>"Heer's yuur posy, muther!
Laurie never forgets that," she
sed, putting th fresh noezgae
in th vaess that stuud in "Marmee's

suplied by th affectionate

<p>"Mis Meg March, wun leter
and a gluv," continued

<p>"Whi, I left a paer oever thaer, and heer is oenly wun," sed Meg,
luuking at th grae coton gluv.</p>

<p>"Didn't U drop th uther in th garden?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm shuur I didn't; for thaer wuz oenly wun in th ofis."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">148</span>
"I haet to hav od gluvs! Never miend, th uther mae be found.
Mi leter is oenly a translaeshon of th German song I wontedw; I think
Mr. Brooke did it, for this isn't Laurie's rieting."</p>

<p>Mrs. March glanst at Meg, hoo wuz luuking verry prity in her
gingam morning-goun, with th litl curls bloeing about her forhed,
and verry wuumanly, as she sat soeing at her litl wurk-taebl,
fuul of tidy whiet roels; so unconshus of th thaut in her muther's

wer busied with gurlish fansys as inosent and fresh as th panzys in

<p>"Too leters for Doktor Jo, a book, and a funy oeld hat, which

<p>"Whut a sli felo Laurie is! I sed I wisht biger hats wer

<p class="noindent">
Sum English gurls and boys ar cuming to see me to-morro and I

Longmeadow, and row (noun) up th hoel croo to lunch and croquet,—hav
a fier, maek meses, jipsy fashon, and all sorts of larks. Thae
ar niess peepl, and liek such things. Brooke wil go, to keep us
boys steady, and Kate Vaughn wil plae propriety for th gurls. I
wont U all to cum; can't let Beth off, at any priess, and noebody
shal wury her. Don't bother about rashons,—I'll see to that, and
everything else,—oenly do cum, thaer's a guud felo!</p>


<p class="letter-trail1">
     "In a teering hurry,<br>
      Yuurs ever, <span class="smc">Laurie</span>."
</p>

<p>"Heer's richnes!" cried Jo, flieing in to tel th nues to Meg.</p>

<p>"Of corss we can go, muther? it wil be such a help to Laurie,
for I can row (noun), and Meg see to th lunch, and th children be uesful
in sum wae."</p>

<p>"I hoep th Vaughns ar not fien, groen-up peepl. Do U
noe anything about them, Jo?" askt Meg.</p>

<p>"Oenly that thaer ar foer of them. Kate is oelder than U, Fred
and Frank (twins) about mi aej, and a litl gurl (Graess), hoo is
nien or ten. Laurie knew them abraud, and liked th boys; I fansyd,
from th wae he primmed up his mouth in speeking of her, that he
didn't admier Kate much."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad mi French print is cleen; it's just th thing, and so
<span class="pagenum2">150</span>
becuming!" obzurvd Meg complacently. "Hav U anything
deesent, Jo?"</p>

<p>"Scarlet and grae boeting suit, guud enough for me. I shal row (noun)
and tramp about, so I don't wont any starch to think of. U'll
cum, Bethy?"</p>

<p>"If U wun't let any of th boys tauk to me."</p>

<p>"Not a boy!"</p>

<p>"I liek to pleez Laurie; and I'm not afraed of Mr. Brooke, he is
so kiend; but I don't wont to plae, or sing, or sae anything. I'll
wurk hard, and not trubl any wun; and U'll taek caer of me, Jo,
so I'll go."</p>

<p>"That's mi guud gurl; U do tri to fiet off yuur shienes, and I
luv U for it. Fieting faults isn't eezy, as I noe; and a cheery
wurd kiend of givs a lift. Thank U, muther," and Jo gaev th thin
cheek a graetful kis, mor precious to Mrs. March than if it had
given bak th roezy roundnes of her yooth.</p>

<p>"I had a box of chocolat drops, and th pikcher I wontedw to
copy," sed Amy, shoeing her mael.</p>

<p>"And I got a noet from Mr. Laurence, asking me to cum oever
and plae to him to-niet, befor th lamps ar lieted, and I shal
go," aded Beth, hoos frendship with th oeld jentlman prosperd
fienly.</p>

<p>"Now let's fli round, and do dubl duty to-dae, so that we can
plae to-morro with free miends," sed Jo, prepaering to replaess her
pen with a broom.</p>

<p>When th sun peept into th gurls' room eerly next morning, to
promis them a fien dae, he saw a comikal siet. Eech had maed
such preparaeshon for th fête as seemd nesesaery and proper. Meg
had an extra row (noun) of litl curl-paepers acros her forhed, Jo had
copiously anointed her aflikted faess with coeld creem, Beth had taeken
Joanna to bed with her to atone for th approaching separaeshon, and
Amy had capt th cliemax by putting a cloeths-pin on her noez, to
uplift th ofending feechuur. It wuz wun of th kiend artists uez to hoeld
th paeper on thaer drawing-bords, thaerfor qiet aproepriat and
efektiv for th purpos to which it wuz now put. This funy spektakl
apeerd to amuez th sun, for he burst out with such raedianss
<span class="pagenum2">151</span>
that Jo woek up, and rouzd all her sisters by a harty laf at Amy's
ornament.</p>

</div>

<p>Sunshine and lafter wer guud oemens for a plezher party, and
soon a lievly busl began in boeth houses. Beth, hoo wuz redy furst,
kept reporting whut went on next dor, and enlivened her sisters'
toilets by freeqent telegrams from th windo.</p>

<p>"Thaer goes th man with th tent! I see Mrs. Barker dooing up
th lunch in a hamper and a graet basket. Now Mr. Laurence is
luuking up at th ski, and th wethercok; I wish he wuud go, too.
Thaer's Laurie, luuking liek a saelor,—niess boy! O, mursy me!
heer's a carrej fuul of peepl—a taul laedy, a litl gurl, and too
dredful boys. Wun is laem; puur thing, he's got a cruch. Laurie
didn't tel us that. Be qik, gurls! it's geting laet. Whi, thaer
is Ned Moffat, I do declaer. Luuk, Meg, isn't that th man hoo
bowd to U wun dae, when we wer shoping?"</p>

<p>"So it is. How qeer that he should cum. I thaut he wuz at
th Mountens. Thaer is Sallie; I'm glad she got bak in tiem.
Am I all riet, Jo?" cried Meg, in a flutter.</p>

<p>"A reguelar daezy. Hoeld up yuur dres and put yuur hat straet;
it luuks sentimental tipt that wae, and wil fli off at th furst puff.
Now, then, cum on!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">152</span>
"O Jo, U ar not going to waer that auful hat? It's too
absurd! U shal <em>not</em> maek a gie of yuurself," remonstraeted Meg,
as Jo tied doun, with a red ribon, th braud-brimmed, oeld-fashond
Leghorn Laurie had sent for a joek.</p>

<p>"I just wil, tho, for it's capital,—so shaedy, liet, and big. It
wil maek fun; and I don't miend being a gie if I'm comfortable."
With that Jo marcht straet away, and th rest foloed,—a briet
litl band of sisters, all luuking thaer best, in sumer suits, with hapy
faeses under th jaunty hat-brims.</p>

<p>Laurie ran to meet, and prezent them to his frends, in th moest
corjal maner. Th laun wuz th resepshon-room, and for several
minits a lievly seen wuz enakted thaer. Meg wuz graetful to see
that Mis Kate, tho twenty, wuz drest with a simplisity which
American gurls wuud do wel to imitaet; and she wuz much flaterd
by Mr. Ned's assurances that he caem especially to see her. Jo
understuud whi Laurie "primmed up his mouth" when speeking of
Kate, for that yung laedy had a stand-off-don't-tuch-me aer, which
contrasted strongly with th free and eezy demeanor of th uther
gurls. Beth tuuk an obzervaeshon of th nue boys, and desieded that
th laem wun wuz not "dredful," but jentl and feebl, and she
wuud be kiend to him on that account. Amy found Graess a wel-manerd,
merry litl purson; and after staering dumly at wun anuther
for a fue minits, thae sudenly becaem verry guud frends.</p>

<p>Tents, lunch, and croquet uetensils having been sent on beforehand,
th party wuz soon embarked, and th too boets pushed off together,
leeving Mr. Laurence waeving his hat on th shor. Laurie and Jo
roed wun boet; Mr. Brooke and Ned th uther; whiel Fred Vaughn,
th rieotus twin, did his best to upset boeth by padling about in a
wherry liek a disturbs wauter-bug. Jo's funy hat dezurvd a voet
of thanks, for it wuz of jeneral uetility; it broek th iess in th begining,
by producing a laf; it creaeted qiet a refreshing breez, flaping
to and fro, as she roed, and wuud maek an exselent umbrela
for th hoel party, if a shower caem up, she sed. Kate luukt
rather amaezd at Jo's proceedings, especially as she exclaemd
"Christopher Columbus!" when she lost her or; and Laurie sed,
"Mi deer felo, did I hurt U?" when he tript oever her feet in
<span class="pagenum2">153</span>
taeking his plaess. But after putting up her glas to examine th qeer
gurl several times, Mis Kate desieded that she wuz "od, but rather
clever," and smield upon her from afar.</p>

<p>Meg, in th uther boet, wuz delietfuly situated, faess to faess
with th rowers, hoo boeth admierd th prospekt, and fetherd thaer
ors with uncomon "skil and dexterrity." Mr. Brooke wuz a graev,
silent yung man, with handsum broun ies and a plezant vois.
Meg liked his qieet maners, and considerd him a wauking encyclopædia
of uesful nolej. He never taukt to her much; but he
luukt at her a guud deel, and she felt shuur that he did not regard her
with avurzhon. Ned, being in colej, of corss put on all th aers
which Freshmen think it thaer bounden duty to asuem; he wuz not
verry wiez, but verry guud-naecherd, and aultogether an exselent purson
to carry on a picnic. Sallie Gardiner wuz absorbd in keeping her
whiet piqué dres cleen, and chatering with th uebiqitus Fred, hoo
kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks.</p>

<p>It wuz not far to Longmeadow; but th tent wuz picht and th
wikets doun by th tiem thae arrived. A plezant green feeld, with
three wied-spreding oeks in th midl, and a smooth strip of turf
for croquet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">154</span>
"Welcum to Camp Laurence!" sed th yung hoest, as thae
landed, with exclamaeshons of deliet.</p>

<p>"Brooke is comander-in-cheef; I am commissary-jeneral; th
uther feloes ar staf-ofisers; and U, laedys, ar company. Th
tent is for yuur especial benefit, and that oek is yuur drawing-room;
this is th mes-room, and th thurd is th camp-kichen.
Now, let's hav a gaem befor it gets hot, and then we'll see about
diner."</p>

<p>Frank, Beth, Amy, and Graess sat doun to woch th gaem plaed
by th uther aet. Mr. Brooke choez Meg, Kate, and Fred; Laurie
tuuk Sallie, Jo, and Ned. Th Englishers plaed wel; but th
Americans plaed beter, and contested every inch of th ground as
strongly as if th spirit of '76 inspired them. Jo and Fred had several
skirmishes, and wunss narroely escaept hie wurds. Jo wuz
thru th last wiket, and had mist th stroek, which faeluer rufld
her a guud deel. Fred wuz cloez behind her, and his turn caem
befor hers; he gaev a stroek, his baul hit th wiket, and stopt an
inch on th rong sied. No wun wuz verry neer; and runing up to
examine, he gaev it a sli nuj with his toe, which put it just an inch
on th riet sied.</p>

<p>"I'm thru! Now, Mis Jo, I'll setl U, and get in furst,"
cried th yung jentlman, swinging his malet for anuther blo.</p>

<p>"U pushed it; I saw U; it's mi turn now," sed Jo sharply.</p>

<p>"Upon mi wurd, I didn't moov it; it roeld a bit, perhaps, but
that is alowd; so stand off, pleez, and let me hav a go at th
staek."</p>

<p>"We don't cheet in America, but U can, if U chooz," sed Jo
anggrily.</p>

<p>"Yankees ar a deel th moest triky, everybody noes. Thaer
U go!" returnd Fred, croqueting her baul far away.</p>

<p>Jo oepend her lips to sae sumthing rood, but chekt herself in
tiem, culord up to her forhed, and stuud a mienuet, hamering
doun a wiket with all her miet, whiel Fred hit th staek, and declaerd
himself out with much exultaeshon. She went off to get her
baul, and wuz a long tiem fiending it, amung th bushes; but she caem
bak, luuking cool and qieet, and waeted her turn paeshently. It tuuk
<span class="pagenum2">155</span>
several stroeks to regaen th plaess she had lost; and, when she got
thaer, th uther sied had neerly wun, for Kate's baul wuz th last but
wun, and lae neer th staek.</p>

<p>"By George, it's all up with us! Guud-by, Kate. Mis Jo oes
me wun, so U ar finisht," cried Fred exsietedly, as thae all droo
neer to see th finish.</p>

<p>"Yankees hav a trik of being jenerus to thaer enemys," sed Jo,
with a luuk that maed th lad reden, "especially when thae beet
them," she aded, as, leeving Kate's baul untucht, she wun th
gaem by a clever stroek.</p>

<p>Laurie throo up his hat; then rememberd that it wouldn't do to
exult oever th defeet of his guests, and stopt in th midl of a
cheer to whisper to his frend,—</p>

<p>"Guud for U, Jo! He did cheet, I saw him; we can't tel him so,
but he wun't do it again, taek mi wurd for it."</p>

<p>Meg droo her asied, under preetenss of pining up a looss braed,
and sed approvingly,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">156</span>
"It wuz dredfuly provoeking; but U kept yuur temper, and I'm
so glad, Jo."</p>

<p>"Don't praez me, Meg, for I cuud box his eers this mienuet. I
should surtenly hav boild oever if I hadn't staed amung th netls
till I got mi raej under enough to hoeld mi tung. It's simering
now, so I hoep he'll keep out of mi wae," returnd Jo, bieting her
lips, as she glowerd at Fred from under her big hat.</p>

<p>"Tiem for lunch," sed Mr. Brooke, luuking at his woch. "Commissary-jeneral,
wil U maek th fier and get wauter, whiel Mis
March, Mis Sallie, and I spred th taebl? Hoo can maek guud
cofy?"</p>

<p>"Jo can," sed Meg, glad to recomend her sister. So Jo, feeling
that her laet lesons in cuukery wer to do her onor, went to prezied
oever th cofy-pot, whiel th children colekted dri stiks, and th
boys maed a fier, and got wauter from a spring neer by. Mis Kate
skecht, and Frank taukt to Beth, hoo wuz maeking litl mats of
braeded rushes to surv as plaets.</p>

<p>Th comander-in-cheef and his aeds soon spred th taebl-cloth
with an invieting arae of eetabls and drinkables, pritily decoraeted
with green leevs. Jo anounst that th cofy wuz redy, and
every wun setld themselvs to a harty meel; for yooth is seldom
dispeptik, and exercise develops hoelsum apetiets. A verry merry
lunch it wuz; for everything seemd fresh and funy, and freeqent
peals of lafter startld a venerable horss hoo fed neer by. Thaer
wuz a pleezing ineqolity in th taebl, which produced meny mis-haps
to cups and plaets; aecorns dropt into th milk, litl blak ants
partuuk of th refreshments without being invieted, and fuzy catepilars
swung doun from th tree, to see whut wuz going on. Three
whiet-heded children peept oever th fenss, and an objekshonabl
dog barkt at them from th uther sied of th river with all his miet
and maen.</p>

<p>"Thaer's sault heer, if U prefur it," sed Laurie, as he handed Jo
a sauser of berrys.</p>

<p>"Thank U, I prefur spieders," she replied, fishing up too unwaery

<span class="pagenum2">157</span>
aded Jo, as thae boeth laft, and aet out of wun plaet, th china
having run short.</p>

<p>"I had an uncomonly guud tiem that dae, and haeven't got oever
it yet. This is no credit to me, U noe; I don't do anything; it's
U and Meg and Brooke hoo maek it go, and I'm no end obliejd
to U. Whut shal we do when we can't eat any mor?" askt Laurie,
feeling that his trump card had been plaed when lunch wuz oever.</p>

<p>"Hav gaems, till it's cooler. I brought 'Authors,' and I daer sae
Mis Kate noes sumthing nue and niess. Go and ask her; she's

keeps tauking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them thru that ridicuelus
glas of hers. I'm going, so U needn't tri to preech propriety,
for U can't do it, Jo."</p>

<p>Mis Kate did noe several nue gaems; and as th gurls wuud
not, and th boys cuud not, eat any mor, thae all ajurnd to th
drawing-room to plae "Rigmarole."</p>

<p>"Wun purson begins a story, any nonsenss U liek, and tels as

when wel dun, and maeks a perfect jumbl of tragical comikal stuf

aer, which serpriezd Meg, hoo treated th tuetor with as
much respekt as any uther jentlman.</p>

<p>Lieing on th gras at th feet of th too yung laedys, Mr. Brooke

saeing, and pushed his cruch away from him with an impaeshent jescher
as he wocht th aktiv lads going thru all sorts of comikal
gymnastics. Beth, hoo wuz colekting th scaterd Author-cards,
luukt up, and sed, in her shi yet frendly wae,—</p>

<p>"I'm afraed U ar tierd; can I do anything for U?"</p>

<p>"Tauk to me, pleez; it's dul, sitting by mieself," anserd Frank,
hoo had evidently been uezd to being maed much of at hoem.</p>

<p>If he had askt her to deliver a Latin oraeshon, it wuud not hav
seemd a mor imposibl task to bashful Beth; but thaer wuz no
plaess to run to, no Jo to hied behind now, and th puur boy luukt
so wistfuly at her, that she bravely rezolvd to tri.</p>

<p>"Whut do U liek to tauk about?" she askt, fumbling oever th
cards, and droping haf as she tried to tie them up.</p>

<p>"Wel, I liek to heer about criket and boeting and hunting," sed
Frank, hoo had not yet lurnd to suit his amuezments to his strength.</p>

<p>"Mi hart! whut shal I do? I don't noe anything about
them," thaut Beth; and, forgeting th boy's misforchun in her
flury, she sed, hoeping to maek him tauk, "I never saw any hunting,
but I supoez U noe all about it."</p>

<p>"I did wunss; but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leeping
a confounded fiev-bard gaet; so thaer ar no mor horses and
hounds for me," sed Frank, with a sie that maed Beth haet herself
for her inosent blunder.</p>

<p>"Yuur deer ar much prityer than our ugly buffaloes," she sed,
turning to th prairies for help, and feeling glad that she had red wun
of th boys' books in which Jo delieted.</p>

<p>Buffaloes proovd soothing and satisfaktory; and, in her eegernes
to amuez anuther, Beth forgot herself, and wuz qiet unconshus
<span class="pagenum2">170</span>
of her sisters' serpriez and deliet at th uenuezhual spektakl of Beth
tauking away to wun of th dredful boys, against hoom she had
begd protection.</p>

<p>"Bles her hart! She pitys him, so she is guud to him," sed Jo,
beeming at her from th croquet-ground.</p>

<p>"I aulwaes sed she wuz a litl saent," aded Meg, as if thaer cuud
be no further dout of it.</p>

<p>"I haeven't hurd Frank laf so much for ever so long," sed
Graess to Amy, as thae sat discusing dols, and maeking tee-sets out
of th aecorn-cups.</p>

<p>"Mi sister Beth is a verry <em>fastidius</em> gurl, when she lieks to be,"
sed Amy, wel pleezd at Beth's success. She ment "fasinaeting,"
but as Graess didn't noe th exakt meening of eether wurd, "fastidius"
sounded wel, and maed a guud impreshon.</p>

<p>An impromptoo surcus, fox and geess, and an amicabl gaem of croquet,
finisht th afternoon. At sunset th tent wuz struk, hampers
pakt, wikets puuld up, boets loeded, and th hoel party floeted
doun th river, singing at th tops of thaer voises. Ned, geting sentimental,
worbld a serenaed with th pensiv refraen,—</p>

<p class="center">"Aloen, aloen, ah! wo, aloen,"</p>

<p>and at th liens—</p>

<div class="poem1">
<p class="indent30 left-indent10">
   "We eech ar yung, we eech hav a hart,</p>
<p class="indent25 left-indent10">

<p class="noindent">
he luukt at Meg with such a lacadaezikal expreshon that she
laft outriet and spoilt his song.</p>

<p>"How can U be so crooel to me?" he whisperd, under cuver of
a lievly corus. "U've kept cloez to that starcht-up Englishwoman
all dae, and now U snub me."</p>

<p>"I didn't meen to; but U luukt so funy I reealy couldn't
help it," replied Meg, pasing oever th furst part of his reproech; for
it wuz qiet troo that she <em>had</em> shund him, remembering th Moffat
party and th tauk after it.</p>

<p>Ned wuz ofended, and turnd to Sallie for consolaeshon, saeing
to her rather pettishly, "Thaer isn't a bit of flurt in that gurl, is
thaer?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">171</span>
"Not a partikl; but she's a deer," returnd Sallie, defending her
frend eeven whiel confesing her short-comings.</p>

<p>"She's not a striken deer, any wae," sed Ned, trieing to be wity,
and succeeding as wel as verry yung jentlmen uezhualy do.</p>

<p>On th laun, whaer it had gatherd, th litl party separaeted with
corjal guud-niets and guud-byes, for th Vaughns wer going to
Canada. As th foer sisters went hoem thru th garden, Mis
Kate luukt after them, saeing, without th patronizing toen in her
vois, "In spiet of thaer demonstrativ maners, American gurls ar
verry niess when wun noes them."</p>

<p>"I qiet agree with U," sed Mr. Brooke.</p>

<p class="h2a">Casls IN Th Aer.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Laurie</span> lae lugzhuriusly swinging to and fro in his hamok, wun
worm September afternoon, wundering whut his naebors wer about,
but too laezy to go and fiend out. He wuz in wun of his moods; for
th dae had been boeth unprofitabl and unsatisfaktory, and he wuz
wishing he cuud liv it oever again. Th hot wether maed him
indolent, and he had shurkt his studys, tried Mr. Brooke's paeshenss
to th utmoest, displeezd his grandfaather by practising haf th afternoon,
frietend th maed-survants haf out of thaer wits, by mischivusly
hinting that wun of his dogs wuz going mad, and, after hie
wurds with th staebl-man about sum fansyd neglekt of his horss, he
<span class="pagenum2">173</span>
had flung himself into his hamok, to fume oever th stoopidity of th
wurld in jeneral, till th peess of th luvly dae qieeted him in spiet
of himself. Staering up into th green gloom of th horss-chestnut
trees abuv him, he dreemd dreems of all sorts, and wuz just imajining
himself tosing on th oeshan, in a voyej round th wurld, when
th sound of voises brought him ashore in a flash. Peeping thru
th meshes of th hamok, he saw th Marches cuming out, as if
bound on sum expedishon.</p>

<p>"Whut in th wurld ar thoes gurls about now?" thaut Laurie,
oepening his sleepy ies to taek a guud luuk, for thaer wuz sumthing
rather peculiar in th apeeranss of his naebors. Eech wor a
larj, flaping hat, a broun linen pouch slung oever wun shoulder, and
carried a long staf. Meg had a cuushon, Jo a book, Beth a basket,
and Amy a portfolio. All waukt qieetly thru th garden, out at
th litl bak gaet, and began to cliem th hil that lae between th
hous and river.</p>

<p>"Wel, that's cool!" sed Laurie to himself, "to hav a picnic and
never ask me. Thae can't be going in th boet, for thae haeven't
got th kee. Perhaps thae forgot it; I'll taek it to them, and see
whut's going on."</p>

<p>Tho possessed of haf a duzen hats, it tuuk him sum tiem to
fiend wun; then thaer wuz a hunt for th kee, which wuz at last discuverd
in his poket; so that th gurls wer qiet out of siet when
he leept th fenss and ran after them. Taeking th shortest wae to
th boet-hous, he waeted for them to apeer: but no wun caem, and
he went up th hil to taek an obzervaeshon. A groev of piens cuverd
wun part of it, and from th hart of this green spot caem a cleerer
sound than th soft sie of th piens or th drouzy churp of th
crikets.</p>

<p>"Heer's a landscaep!" thaut Laurie, peeping thru th bushes,
and luuking wied-awake and guud-naecherd aulredy.</p>

<p>It <em>wuz</em> rather a prity litl pikcher; for th sisters sat together in
th shaedy nuuk, with sun and shado flikering oever them, th arroematik
wiend lifting thaer haer and cooling thaer hot cheeks, and all
th litl wuud-peepl going on with thaer affairs as if thees wer no
straenjers, but oeld frends. Meg sat upon her cuushon, soeing daintily
<span class="pagenum2">174</span>
with her whiet hands, and luuking
as fresh and sweet as a roez, in her
pink dres, amung th green. Beth
wuz sorting th coens that lae thik
under th hemlok neer by, for she maed prity things of them.
Amy wuz skeching a groop of furns, and Jo wuz niting as she
red aloud. A shado past oever th boy's faess as he wocht
them, feeling that he aut to go away, because uninvieted; yet linggering,
because hoem seemd verry loenly, and this qieet party in th
wuuds moest atraktiv to his restles spirit. He stuud so still that a
squirrel, busy with its harvesting, ran doun a pien cloez besied him,
saw him sudenly and skipt bak, scoelding so shrily that Beth
luukt up, espied th wistful faess behind th burches, and becond
with a re-ashuuring smiel.</p>

<p>"Mae I cum in, pleez? or shal I be a bother?" he askt, advansing
sloely.</p>

<p>Meg lifted her iebrows, but Jo scould at her defieantly, and sed,
at wunss, "Of corss U mae. We should hav askt U befor,
oenly we thaut U wouldn't caer for such a gurl's gaem as this."</p>

<p>"I aulwaes liked yuur gaems; but if Meg doesn't wont me, I'll go
away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">175</span>
"I've no objekshon, if U do sumthing; it's against th rools to
be iedl heer," replied Meg, gravely but graeshusly.</p>

<p>"Much obliejd; I'll do anything if U'll let me stop a bit, for
it's as dul as th Dezurt of Sahara doun thaer. Shal I soe, red,
coen, draw, or do all at wunss? Bring on yuur baers; I'm redy,"
and Laurie sat doun, with a submissive expreshon delietful to
behoeld.</p>

<p>"Finish this story whiel I set mi heel," sed Jo, handing him th
book.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," wuz th meek anser, as he began, dooing his best to
proov his gratitood for th faevor of an admishon into th "Busy Bee
Soesieety."</p>

<p>Th story wuz not a long wun, and, when it wuz finisht, he ventured
to ask a fue qeschons as a reword of merrit.</p>

<p>"Pleez, maa'am, cuud I inqier if this hiely instruktiv and
charming institooshon is a nue wun?"</p>

<p>"Wuud U tel him?" askt Meg of her sisters.</p>

<p>"He'll laf," sed Amy warningly.</p>

<p>"Hoo caers?" sed Jo.</p>

<p>"I ges he'll liek it," aded Beth.</p>

<p>"Of corss I shal! I giv U mi wurd I wun't laf. Tel
away, Jo, and don't be afraed."</p>

<p>"Th iedeea of being afraed of U! Wel, U see we uezd to plae
'Pilgrim's Progres,' and we hav been going on with it in urnest, all
winter and sumer."</p>

<p>"Yes, I noe," sed Laurie, noding wiezly.</p>

<p>"Hoo toeld U?" demanded Jo.</p>

<p>"Spirits."</p>

<p>"No, I did; I wontedw to amuez him wun niet when U wer all
away, and he wuz rather dizmal. He did liek it, so don't scoeld, Jo,"
sed Beth meekly.</p>

<p>"U can't keep a seecret. Never miend; it saevs trubl now."</p>

<p>"Go on, pleez," sed Laurie, as Jo becaem absorbd in her wurk,
luuking a trifle displeezd.</p>

<p>"O, didn't she tel U about this nue plan of ours? Wel, we
hav tried not to waest our holidae, but eech has had a task, and
<span class="pagenum2">176</span>
wurkt at it with a wil. Th vaecaeshon is neerly oever, th stints ar
all dun, and we ar ever so glad that we didn't daudl."</p>

<p>"Yes, I should think so;" and Laurie thaut regretfully of his
oen iedl daes.</p>

<p>"Muther lieks to hav us out of dors as much as posibl; so we
bring our wurk heer, and hav niess times. For th fun of it we bring
our things in thees bags, waer th oeld hats, uez poels to cliem th
hil, and plae pilgrims, as we uezd to do yeers ago. We call this hil
th 'Delektabl Mounten,' for we can luuk far away and see th
cuntry whaer we hoep to liv sum tiem."</p>

<p>Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine; for thru an oepening
in th wuud wun cuud luuk acros th wied, bloo river, th medoes
on th uther sied, far oever th outscurts of th graet sity, to th green
hils that roez to meet th ski. Th sun wuz loe, and th hevens
gloed with th splendor of an autumn sunset. Goeld and purpl
clouds lae on th hil-tops; and riezing hie into th rudy liet wer
silvery whiet peeks, that shone liek th aery spiers of sum Seleschal
Sity.</p>

<p>"How buetiful that is!" sed Laurie softly, for he wuz qik to
see and feel buety of any kiend.</p>

<p>"It's ofen so; and we liek to woch it, for it is never th saem,
but aulwaes splendid," replied Amy, wishing she cuud paent it.</p>

<p>"Jo tauks about th cuntry whaer we hoep to liv sum tiem,—th
reeal cuntry, she means, with pigs and chikens, and haymaking. It
wuud be niess, but I wish th buetiful cuntry up thaer wuz reeal, and
we cuud ever go to it," sed Beth muezingly.</p>

<p>"Thaer is a luvlyer cuntry eeven than that, whaer we <em>shal</em> go, by
and by, when we ar guud enough," anserd Meg, with her sweet
vois.</p>

<p>"It seems so long to waet, so hard to do; I wont to fli away at
wunss, as thoes swallows fli, and go in at that splendid gaet."</p>

<p>"U'll get thaer, Beth, sooner or laeter; no feer of that," sed Jo;
"I'm th wun that wil hav to fiet and wurk, and cliem and waet,
and maebe never get in after all."</p>

<p>"U'll hav me for company, if that's any cumfort. I shal hav
to do a deel of travelling befor I cum in siet of yuur Seleschal
<span class="pagenum2">177</span>
Sity. If I arrive laet, U'll sae a guud wurd for me, wun't U,
Beth?"</p>

<p>Sumthing in th boy's faess trubld his litl frend; but she sed
cheerfuly, with her qieet ies on th chaenjing clouds, "If peepl
reealy wont to go, and reealy tri all thaer lievs, I think thae wil get in;
for I don't beleev thaer ar any loks on that dor, or any guards at
th gaet. I aulwaes imajin it is as it is in th pikcher, whaer th
shiening wuns strech out thaer hands to welcum puur Christian as he
cums up from th river."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be fun if all th casls in th aer which we maek cuud
cum troo, and we cuud liv in them?" sed Jo, after a litl pause.</p>

<p>"I've maed such qontitys it wuud be hard to chooz which I'd
hav," sed Laurie, lieing flat, and throeing coens at th squirrel hoo
had betraed him.</p>

<p>"U'd hav to taek yuur faevorit wun. Whut is it?" askt Meg.</p>

<p>"If I tel mien, wil U tel yuurs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if th gurls wil too."</p>

<p>"We wil. Now, Laurie."</p>

<p>"After I'd seen as much of th wurld as I wont to, I'd liek to
setl in Germany, and hav just as much muezik as I chooz. I'm
to be a faemus muezishan mieself, and all creaeshon is to rush to heer
me; and I'm never to be botherd about muny or business, but
just enjoy mieself, and liv for whut I liek. That's mi faevorit casl.
Whut's yuurs, Meg?"</p>

<p>Margaret seemd to fiend it a litl hard to tel hers, and waevd a
braek befor her faess, as if to dispurss imajinarry nats, whiel she
sed sloely, "I should liek a luvly hous, fuul of all sorts of lugzhuurius
things,—niess food, prity cloeths, handsum furnicher, plezant peepl,
and heeps of muny. I am to be mistres of it, and manej it as I
liek, with plenty of survants, so I never need wurk a bit. How I
should enjoy it! for I wouldn't be iedl, but do guud, and maek
every wun luv me deerly."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't U hav a master for yuur casl in th aer?" askt
Laurie sliely.</p>

<p>"I sed 'plezant peepl,' U noe;" and Meg carefully tied up
her shoo as she spoek, so that no wun saw her faess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">178</span>
"Whi don't U sae U'd hav a splendid, wiez, guud huzband,
and sum anjelik litl children? U noe yuur casl wouldn't be
perfect without," sed blunt Jo, hoo had no tender fansys yet, and
rather scornd roemanss, exsept in books.</p>

<p>"U'd hav nuthing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yuurs,"
anserd Meg petulantly.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't I, tho? I'd hav a staebl fuul of Arabian steeds,
rooms pield with books, and I'd riet out of a majik inkstand, so
that mi wurks should be as faemus as Laurie's muezik. I wont to do
sumthing splendid befor I go into mi casl,—sumthing heroeik or
wunderful, that wun't be forgoten after I'm ded. I don't noe
whut, but I'm on th woch for it, and meen to astonish U all, sum
dae. I think I shal riet books, and get rich and faemus: that
wuud suit me, so that is <em>mi</em> faevorit dreem."</p>

<p>"Mien is to stae at hoem saef with faather and muther, and help
taek caer of th family," sed Beth contentedly.</p>

<p>"Don't U wish for anything else?" askt Laurie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">179</span>
"Sinss I had mi litl piano, I am perfectly satisfied. I oenly
wish we mae all keep wel and be together; nuthing else."</p>

<p>"I hav ever so meny wishes; but th pet wun is to be an artist,
and go to Rome, and do fien pikchers, and be th best artist in th
hoel wurld," wuz Amy's modest dezier.</p>

<p>"We're an ambishus set, aren't we? Every wun of us, but Beth,
wonts to be rich and faemus, and gorjus in every respekt. I do
wunder if any of us wil ever get our wishes," sed Laurie, chooing
gras, liek a meditaetiv caf.</p>

<p>"I've got th kee to mi casl in th aer; but whether I can

<p>"I've got th kee to mien, but I'm not alowd to tri it. Hang

<p>"Heer's mien!" and Amy waevd her pensil.</p>

<p>"I haeven't got any," sed Meg forlornly.</p>

<p>"Yes, U hav," sed Laurie at wunss.</p>

<p>"Whaer?"</p>

<p>"In yuur faess."</p>

<p>"Nonsenss; that's of no uez."</p>

<p>"Waet and see if it doesn't bring U sumthing wurth having,"
replied th boy, lafing at th thaut of a charming litl seecret
which he fansyd he knew.</p>

<p>Meg culord behind th braek, but askt no qeschons, and luukt
acros th river with th saem expectant expreshon which Mr. Brooke
had worn when he toeld th story of th niet.</p>

<p>"If we ar all aliev ten yeers henss, let's meet, and see how meny
of us hav got our wishes, or how much neerer we ar then than
now," sed Jo, aulwaes redy with a plan.</p>

<p>"Bles me! how oeld I shal be,—twenty-seven!" exclaemd Meg
hoo felt groen up aulredy, having just reached seventeen.</p>

<p>"U and I shal be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-foer, and
Amy twenty-too. Whut a venerable party!" sed Jo.</p>

<p>"I hoep I shal hav dun sumthing to be proud of by that tiem;
but I'm such a laezy dog, I'm afraed I shal 'daudl,' Jo."</p>

<p>"U need a moetiv, muther sez; and when U get it, she is
shuur U'll wurk splendidly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">180</span>
"Is she? By Jupiter I wil, if I oenly get th chanss!" cried
Laurie, sitting up with suden enerjy. "I aut to be satisfied to
pleez grandfaather, and I do tri, but it's wurking against th graen,
U see, and cums hard. He wonts me to be an India murchant,
as he wuz, and I'd rather be shot. I haet tee and silk and spieses,
and every sort of rubish his oeld ships bring, and I don't caer how
soon thae go to th bottom when I oen them. Going to colej
aut to satisfi him, for if I giv him foer yeers he aut to let me
off from th business; but he's set, and I 've got to do just as he did,
unles I braek away and pleez mieself, as mi faather did. If thaer
wuz any wun left to stae with th oeld jentlman, I'd do it to-morro."</p>

<p>Laurie spoek exsietedly, and luukt redy to carry his thret into
exsecueshon on th slightest provocaeshon; for he wuz groeing up verry
fast, and, in spiet of his indolent waes, had a yung man's haetred of
subjekshon, a yung man's restles longing to tri th wurld for himself.</p>

<p>"I advise U to sael away in wun of yuur ships, and never cum
hoem again till U hav tried yuur oen wae," sed Jo, hoos imajinaeshon
wuz fierd by th thaut of such a daring exploit, and hoos
simpathy wuz exsieted by whut she called "Teddy's rongs."</p>

<p>"That's not riet, Jo; U mustn't tauk in that wae, and Laurie
mustn't taek yuur bad advice. U should do just whut yuur grandfaather
wishes, mi deer boy," sed Meg, in her moest maturnal toen.
"Do yuur best at colej, and, when he sees that U tri to pleez
him, I'm shuur he wun't be hard or unjust to U. As U sae, thaer
is no wun else to stae with and luv him, and U'd never forgiv
yuurself if U left him without his permishon. Don't be dizmal or
fret, but do yuur duty; and U'll get yuur reword, as guud Mr.
Brooke has, by being respekted and luvd."</p>

<p>"Whut do U noe about him?" askt Laurie, graetful for th
guud advice, but objekting to th lecture, and glad to turn th conversation
from himself, after his uenuezhual outbraek.</p>

<p>"Oenly whut yuur grandpa toeld us about him,—how he tuuk guud
caer of his oen muther till she died, and wouldn't go abraud as tuetor
to sum niess purson, because he wouldn't leev her; and how he
<span class="pagenum2">181</span>
provides now for an oeld wuuman hoo nurst his muther; and never
tels any wun, but is just as jenerus and paeshent and guud as he
can be."</p>

<p>"So he is, deer oeld felo!" sed Laurie hartily, as Meg paused,
luuking flusht and urnest with her story. "It's liek grandpa to
fiend out all about him, without leting him noe, and to tel all his
guudnes to others, so that thae miet liek him. Brooke couldn't
understand whi yuur
muther wuz so kiend to
him, asking him oever
with me, and treating
him in her buetiful
frendly wae. He
thaut she wuz just
perfect, and taukt
about it for daes and
daes, and went on
about U all in flaeming
stiel. If ever I
do get mi wish, U
see whut I'll do for
Brooke."</p>

<p>"Begin to do sumthing
now, by not
plaeging his lief out,"
sed Meg sharply.</p>

<p>"How do U noe
I do, mis?"</p>

<p>"I can aulwaes tel
by his faess, when he
goes away. If U hav been guud, he luuks satisfied and wauks
briskly; if U hav plaegd him, he's soeber and wauks sloely, as if
he wontedw to go bak and do his wurk beter."</p>

<p>"Wel, I liek that! So U keep an account of mi guud and bad
marks in Brooke's faess, do U? I see him boe and smiel as he
pases yuur windo, but I didn't noe U'd got up a telegraf."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">182</span>
"We haeven't; don't be anggry, and o, don't tel him I sed anything!
It wuz oenly to sho that I caerd how U get on, and whut
is sed heer is sed in confidenss, U noe," cried Meg, much
alarmd at th thaut of whut miet folo from her careless
speech.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> don't tel taels," replied Laurie, with his "hie and miety"
aer, as Jo called a surten expreshon which he ocaezhonaly wor.
"Oenly if Brooke is going to be a thermometer, I must miend and hav
faer wether for him to report."</p>

<p>"Pleez don't be ofended. I didn't meen to preech or tel taels
or be sily; I oenly thaut Jo wuz encurejing U in a feeling which
U'd be sorry for, by and by. U ar so kiend to us, we feel as if
U wer our bruther, and sae just whut we think. Forgiv me, I
ment it kiendly." And Meg oferd her hand with a jescher boeth
affectionate and timid.</p>

<p>Ashamed of his moementaery pique, Laurie sqeezd th kiend litl
hand, and sed frankly, "I'm th wun to be forgiven; I'm cros, and
hav been out of sorts all dae. I liek to hav U tel me mi faults
and be sisterly, so don't miend if I am grumpy sumtiems; I thank
U all th saem."</p>

<p>Bent on shoeing that he wuz not ofended, he maed himself as
agreeabl as posibl,—woond coton for Meg, resieted poetry to pleez
Jo, shuuk doun coens for Beth, and helpt Amy with her furns,
prooving himself a fit purson to belong to th "Busy Bee Soesieety."
In th midst of an animaeted discushon on th domestik habits of
turtles (wun of thoes aemiabl creechers having stroeld up from th
river), th faent sound of a bel wornd them that Hannah had put
th tee "to draw," and thae wuud just hav tiem to get hoem to
super.</p>

<p>"Mae I cum again?" askt Laurie.</p>

<p>"Yes, if U ar guud, and luv yuur book, as th boys in th
primer ar toeld to do," sed Meg smieling.</p>

<p>"I'll tri."</p>

<p>"Then U mae cum, and I'll teech U to nit as th Scotchmen
do; thaer's a demand for soks just now," aded Jo, waeving hers,
liek a big bloo wuusted baner, as thae parted at th gaet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">183</span>
That niet, when Beth plaed to Mr. Laurence in th twilight,
Laurie, standing in th shado of th curten, lisend to th litl
David, hoos simpl muezik aulwaes qieeted his moody spirit, and
wocht th oeld man, hoo sat with his grae hed on his hand, thinking
tender thoughts of th ded chield he had luvd so much. Remembering
th conversation of th afternoon, th boy sed to himself,
with th rezolv to maek th sacrifiess cheerfuly, "I'll let mi casl
go, and stae with th deer oeld jentlman whiel he needs me, for I am
all he has."</p>

<p class="h2a">Seecrets.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Jo</span> wuz verry busy in th garret, for th October daes began to gro
chily, and th afternoons wer short. For too or three ours th sun
lae wormly in th hie windo, shoeing Jo seeted on th oeld soefa,
rieting busily, with her paepers spred out upon a trunk befor her,
whiel Scrabl, th pet rat, promenaded th beems oeverhed, accompanied
by his oeldest sun, a fien yung felo, hoo wuz evidently verry
proud of his whiskers. Qiet absorbd in her wurk, Jo scribld away
till th last paej wuz fild, when she siend her naem with a flurish,
and throo doun her pen, exclaeming,—</p>

<p>"Thaer, I've dun mi best! If this wun't suit I shal hav to waet
till I can do beter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">185</span>
Lieing bak on th soefa, she red th manuescript carefully thru,
maeking dashes heer and thaer, and putting in meny exclamation
points, which luukt liek litl balloons; then she tied it up with a
smart red ribon, and sat a mienuet luuking at it with a soeber, wistful
expreshon, which plainly shoed how urnest her wurk had been.
Jo's desk up heer wuz an oeld tin kichen, which hung against th waul.
In it she kept her paepers and a fue books, saefly shut away from
Scrabl, hoo, being liekwiez of a literaery turn, wuz fond of maeking a
surcuelaeting liebraery of such books as wer left in his wae, by eating th
leevs. From this 
<ins title="Change receptable to receptacle."> 
tin reseptakl Jo produced anuther manuescript;</ins>
and, putting boeth in her poket, crept qieetly doun staers, leeving her
frends to nibl her pens and taest her ink.</p>

<p>She put on her hat and jaket as noizlesly as posibl, and, going
to th bak entry windo, got out upon th roof of a loe porch, swung
herself doun to th grasy bank, and tuuk a roundabout wae to th
roed. Wunss thaer, she compoezd herself, haeld a pasing omnibus,
and roeld away to town, luuking verry merry and misteerius.</p>

<p>If any wun had been woching her, he wuud hav thaut her
moovments decidedly peculiar; for, on alieting, she went off at a
graet paess till she reached a surten number in a surten busy street;
having found th plaess with sum dificulty, she went into th dor-wae,
luukt up th durty staers, and, after standing stok still a mienuet,
sudenly dived into th street, and waukt away as rapidly as she
caem. This manœuvre she repeeted several times, to th graet amuezment
of a blak-ied yung jentlman lounging in th windo of a
bilding opozit. On returning for th thurd tiem, Jo gaev herself a
shaek, puuld her hat oever her ies, and waukt up th staers, luuking
as if she wer going to hav all her teeth out.</p>

<p>Thaer wuz a dentist's sien, amung others, which adornd th
entrance, and, after staering a moement at th paer of artifishal jaws
which sloely oepend and shut to draw atenshon to a fien set of teeth,
th yung jentlman put on his coet, tuuk his hat, and went doun to
poest himself in th opozit 
<ins title="Change doorway to door-way."> 
dor-wae, saeing, </ins> with a smiel and a
shiver,—</p>

<p>"It's liek her to cum aloen, but if she has a bad tiem she'll need
sum wun to help her hoem."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">186</span>
In ten minits Jo caem runing doun staers with a verry red faess,
and th jeneral apeeranss of a purson hoo had just past thru
a trieing ordeel of sum sort. When she saw th yung jentlman she
luukt anything but pleezd, and past him with a nod; but he
foloed, asking with an aer of simpathy,—</p>

<p>"Did U hav a bad tiem?"</p>

<p>"Not verry."</p>

<p>"U got thru qikly."</p>

<p>"Yes, thank guudnes!"</p>

<p>"Whi did U go aloen?"</p>

<p>"Didn't wont any wun to noe."</p>

<p>"U're th odest felo I ever saw. How meny did U hav
out?"</p>

<p>Jo luukt at her frend as if she did not understand him; then
began to laf, as if mietily amuezd at sumthing.</p>

<p>"Thaer ar too which I wont to hav cum out, but I must waet
a week."</p>

<p>"Whut ar U lafing at? U ar up to sum mischif, Jo,"
sed Laurie, luuking mistified.</p>

<p>"So ar U. Whut wer U dooing, sur, up in that billiard saloon?"</p>

<p>"Beging yuur pardon, maa'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but a
gymnasium, and I wuz taeking a leson in fencing."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that."</p>

<p>"Whi?"</p>

<p>"U can teech me, and then when we plae Hamlet, U can be
Laertes, and we'll maek a fien thing of th fencing seen."</p>

<p>Laurie burst out with a harty boy's laf, which maed several
passers-by smiel in spiet of themselvs.</p>

<p>"I'll teech U whether we plae Hamlet or not; it's grand fun,
and wil straeten U up capitally. But I don't beleev that wuz
yuur oenly reezon for saeing 'I'm glad,' in that desieded wae; wuz it,
now?"</p>

<p>"No, I wuz glad that U wer not in th saloon, because I hoep
U never go to such plaeses. Do U?"</p>

<p>"Not ofen."</p>

<p>"I wish U wouldn't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">187</span>
"It's no harm, Jo. I hav billiards at hoem, but it's no fun unles
U hav guud plaeers; so, as I'm fond of it, I cum sumtiems and
hav a gaem with Ned Moffat or sum of th uther feloes."</p>

<p>"O deer, I'm so sorry, for U'll get to lieking it beter and beter,
and wil waest tiem and muny, and gro liek thoes dredful
boys. I did hoep U'd stae respektabl, and be a satisfakshon to
yuur frends," sed Jo, shaeking her hed.</p>

<p>"Can't a felo taek a litl inosent amuezment now and then
without loozing his respektability?" askt Laurie, luuking netld.</p>

<p>"That depends upon how and whaer he taeks it. I don't liek Ned
and his set, and wish U'd keep out of it. Muther wun't let us hav
him at our hous, tho he wonts to cum; and if U gro liek him
she wun't be wiling to hav us frolik together as we do now."</p>

<p>"Wun't she?" askt Laurie anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, she can't baer fashonabl yung men, and she'd shut us all
up in bandboxes rather than hav us asoeshiat with them."</p>

<p>"Wel, she needn't get out her bandboxes yet; I'm not a fashonabl
party, and don't meen to be; but I do liek harmles larks
now and then, don't U?"</p>

<p>"Yes, noebody miends them, so lark away, but don't get wield, wil
U? or thaer wil be an end of all our guud times."</p>

<p>"I'll be a dubl-distild saent."</p>

<p>"I can't baer saents: just be a simpl, onest, respektabl boy,
and we'll never dezurt U. I don't noe whut I <em>should</em> do if U
akted liek Mr. King's sun; he had plenty of muny, but didn't noe
how to spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and
forjd his faather's naem, I beleev, and wuz aultogether horrid."</p>

<p>"U think I'm liekly to do th saem? Much obliejd."</p>

<p>"No, I don't—o, <em>deer</em>, no!—but I heer peepl tauking about
muny being such a temptaeshon, and I sumtiems wish U wer
puur; I shouldn't wury then."</p>

<p>"Do U wury about me, Jo?"</p>

<p>"A litl, when U luuk moody or discontented, as U sumtiems
do; for U've got such a strong wil, if U wunss get started rong,
I'm afraed it wuud be hard to stop U."</p>

<p>Laurie waukt in silence a fue minits, and Jo wocht him, wishing
<span class="pagenum2">188</span>
she had held her tung, for his ies luukt anggry, tho his
lips still smield as if at her warnings.</p>

<p>"Ar U going to deliver lectures all th wae hoem?" he askt
prezently.</p>

<p>"Of corss not; whi?"</p>

<p>"Because if U ar, I'll taek a 'bus; if U ar not, I'd liek to
wauk with U, and tel U sumthing verry interesting."</p>

<p>"I wun't preech any mor, and I'd liek to heer th nues imensly."</p>

<p>"Verry wel, then; cum on. It's a seecret, and if I tel U, U
must tel me yuurs."</p>

<p>"I haeven't got any," began Jo, but stopt sudenly, remembering
that she had.</p>

<p>"U noe U hav,—U can't hied anything; so up and 'fes,
or I wun't tel," cried Laurie.</p>

<p>"Is yuur seecret a niess wun?"</p>

<p>"O, isn't it! all about peepl U noe, and such fun! U
aut to heer it, and I've been aeking to tel it this long tiem.
Cum, U begin."</p>

<p>"U'll not sae anything about it at hoem, wil U?"</p>

<p>"Not a wurd."</p>

<p>"And U wun't teez me in private?"</p>

<p>"I never teez."</p>

<p>"Yes, U do; U get everything U wont out of peepl. I don't
noe how U do it, but U ar a born wheedler."</p>

<p>"Thank U; fier away."</p>

<p>"Wel, I've left too storys with a nuezpaeper man, and he's to
giv his anser next week," whisperd Jo, in her confidant's eer.</p>

<p>"Hooraa for Mis March, th selebraeted American authoress!"
cried Laurie, throeing up his hat and caching it again, to th graet
deliet of too duks, foer cats, fiev hens, and haf a duzen Irish children;
for thae wer out of th sity now.</p>

<p>"Hush! It wun't cum to anything, I daer sae; but I couldn't
rest till I had tried, and I sed nuthing about it, because I didn't
wont any wun else to be disapointed."</p>

<p>"It wun't fael. Whi, Jo, yuur storys ar wurks of Shakespeare,
<span class="pagenum2">189</span>
compaerd to haf th rubish 
<ins title="Change comma to period after every day."> 
that is publisht every dae.</ins> Wun't it
be fun to see them in print; and sha'n't we feel proud of our authoress?"</p>

<p>Jo's ies sparkld, for it is aulwaes plezant to be beleevd in; and
a frend's praez is aulwaes sweeter than a duzen nuezpaeper puffs.</p>

<p>"Whaer's <em>yuur</em> seecret? Plae faer, Teddy, or I'll never beleev
U again," she sed, trieing to extinggwish th brilliant hoeps that
blaezd up at a wurd of encurejment.</p>

<p>"I mae get into a scraep for
teling; but I didn't promis
not to, so I wil, for I never feel
eezy in mi miend till I've toeld
U any plummy bit of nues I
get. I noe whaer Meg's gluv
is."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" sed Jo, luuking
disapointed, as Laurie noded
and twinkled, with a faess
fuul of misteerius intelijenss.</p>

<p>"It's qiet enough for th
prezent, as U'll agree when I
tel U whaer it is."</p>

<p>"Tel, then."</p>

<p>Laurie bent, and whisperd
three wurds in Jo's eer, which
produced a comikal chaenj.
She stuud and staerd at him for
a mienuet, luuking boeth serpriezd
and displeezd, then waukt on,
saeing sharply, "How do U
noe?"</p>

<p>"Saw it."</p>

<p>"Whaer?"</p>

<p>"Poket."</p>

<p>"All this tiem?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">190</span>
"Yes; isn't that roemantik?"</p>

<p>"No, it's horrid."</p>

<p>"Don't U liek it?"</p>

<p>"Of corss I don't. It's ridicuelus; it wun't be alowd. Mi
paeshenss! whut wuud Meg sae?"</p>

<p>"U ar not to tel any wun; miend that."</p>

<p>"I didn't promis."</p>

<p>"That wuz understuud, and I trusted U."</p>

<p>"Wel, I wun't for th prezent, any wae; but I'm disgusted, and
wish U hadn't toeld me."</p>

<p>"I thaut U'd be pleezd."</p>

<p>"At th iedeea of anybody cuming to taek Meg away? No, thank
U."</p>

<p>"U'll feel beter about
it when sumbody cums to

<p>"I'd liek to see any wun

<p>"So should I!" and Laurie
chukld at th iedeea.</p>

<p>"I don't think seecrets
agree with me; I feel rumpld
up in mi miend sinss U
toeld me that," sed Jo, rather
ungraetfuly.</p>

<p>"Raess doun this hil with

sugjested Laurie.</p>

<p>No wun wuz in siet; th
smooth roed sloept invietingly
befor her; and fiending th
temptaeshon irezistibl, Jo darted away, soon leeving hat and coem
behind her, and scatering haer-pins as she ran. Laurie reached th
goel furst, and wuz qiet satisfied with th success of his treatment;
for his Atalanta caem panting up, with flieing haer, briet ies, rudy
cheeks, and no siens of dissatisfaction in her faess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">191</span>
"I wish I wuz a horss; then I cuud run for miels in this splendid
aer, and not looz mi breth. It wuz capital; but see whut a gie it's
maed me. Go, pik up mi things, liek a cherrub as U ar," sed
Jo, droping doun under a maepl-tree, which wuz carpeting th bank
with crimson leevs.</p>

<p>Laurie leezherly departed to recuver th lost property, and Jo bundled
up her braids, hoeping no wun wuud pas by till she wuz tidy
again. But sum wun did pas, and hoo should it be but Meg, luuking
particularly laedyliek in her staet and festival suit, for she had
been maeking calls.</p>

<p>"Whut in th wurld ar U dooing heer?" she askt, regarding
her dishevelled sister with wel-bred serpriez.</p>

<p>"Geting leevs," meekly anserd Jo, sorting th roezy handfuul
she had just swept up.</p>

<p>"And haer-pins," aded Laurie, throeing haf a duzen into Jo's
lap. "Thae gro on this roed, Meg; so do coems and broun straw
hats."</p>

<p>"U hav been runing, Jo; how cuud U? When <em>wil</em> U
stop such romping waes?" sed Meg reproovingly, as she setld her
cufs, and smoothd her haer, with which th wiend had taeken libertys.</p>

<p>"Never till I'm stif and oeld, and hav to uez a cruch. Don't tri
to maek me gro up befor mi tiem, Meg: it's hard enough to hav
U chaenj all of a suden; let me be a litl gurl as long as I can."</p>

<p>As she spoek, Jo bent oever th leevs to hied th trembling of her
lips; for laetly she had felt that Margaret wuz fast geting to be a
wuuman, and Laurie's seecret maed her dred th separaeshon which
must surely cum sum tiem, and now seemd verry neer. He saw
th trubl in her faess, and droo Meg's atenshon from it by asking
qikly, "Whaer hav U been calling, all so fien?"</p>

<p>"At th Gardiners', and Sallie has been teling me all about Belle
Moffat's weding. It wuz verry splendid, and thae hav gon to
spend th winter in Paris. Just think how delietful that must be!"</p>

<p>"Do U envy her, Meg?" sed Laurie.</p>

<p>"I'm afraed I do."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it!" muterd Jo, tieing on her hat with a jurk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">192</span>
"Whi?" askt Meg, luuking serpriezd.</p>

<p>"Because if U caer much about riches, U wil never go and
marry a puur man," sed Jo, frouning at Laurie, hoo wuz mutely
worning her to miend whut she sed.</p>

<p>"I shal never '<em>go</em> and marry' any wun," obzurvd Meg, wauking
on with graet dignity, whiel th others foloed, lafing, whispering,
skiping stoens, and "behaeving liek children," as Meg sed to herself,
tho she miet hav been tempted to join them if she had not had
her best dres on.</p>

<p>For a week or too, Jo behaevd so qeerly that her sisters wer
qiet bewildered. She rusht to th dor when th postman rang;
wuz rood to Mr. Brooke whenever thae met; wuud sit luuking at
Meg with a wo-begone faess, ocaezhonaly jumping up to shaek, and
then to kis her, in a verry misteerius maner; Laurie and she wer
aulwaes maeking siens to wun anuther, and tauking about "Spred Eegls',"
till th gurls declaerd thae had boeth lost thaer wits. On th
second Saturday after Jo got out of th windo, Meg, as she sat
soeing at her windo, wuz scandalized by th siet of Laurie chaesing Jo
all oever th garden, and fienaly capchering her in Amy's bower. Whut
went on thaer, Meg cuud not see; but shreeks of lafter wer hurd,
foloed by th murmer of voises and a graet flaping of nuezpaepers.</p>

<p>"Whut shal we do with that gurl? She never <em>wil</em> behaev liek a
yung laedy," sighed Meg, as she wocht th raess with a disaprooving
faess.</p>

<p>"I hoep she wun't; she is so funy and deer as she is," sed Beth,
hoo had never betraed that she wuz a litl hurt at Jo's having
seecrets with any wun but her.</p>

<p>"It's verry trieing, but we never can maek her <i>commy laa fo</i>," aded
Amy, hoo sat maeking sum nue frils for herself, with her curls tied
up in a verry becuming wae,—too agreeabl things, which maed her
feel unuezhualy elegant and laedyliek.</p>

<p>In a fue minits Jo bounst in, laed herself on th soefa, and affected
to red.</p>

<p>"Hav U anything interesting thaer?" askt Meg, with condescension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">193</span>
"Nuthing but a story; wun't amount to much, I ges," returnd
Jo, carefully keeping th naem of th paeper out of siet.</p>

<p>"U'd beter red it aloud; that wil amuez us and keep U out
of mischif," sed Amy, in her moest groen-up toen.</p>

<p>"Whut's th naem?" askt Beth, wundering whi Jo kept her
faess behind th sheet.</p>

<p>"Th Rieval Paenters."</p>

<p>"That sounds wel; red it," sed Meg.</p>

<p>With a loud "Hem!" and a long breth, Jo began to red verry
fast. Th gurls lisend with interest, for th tael wuz roemantik, and
sumwhot pathetik, as moest of th carrakters died in th end.</p>

<p>"I liek that about th splendid pikcher," wuz Amy's aprooving
remark, as Jo paused.</p>

<p>"I prefur th lovering part. Veoela and Angelo ar too of our
faevorit naems; isn't that qeer?" sed Meg, wieping her ies, for
th "lovering part" wuz tragical.</p>

<p>"Hoo roet it?" askt Beth, hoo had caut a glimps of Jo's
faess.</p>

<p>Th reeder sudenly sat up, cast away th paeper, displaeing a
flusht countenanss, and, with a funy mixcher of solemnity and exsietment,
replied in a loud vois, "Yuur sister."</p>

<p>"U?" cried Meg, droping her wurk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">194</span>
"It's verry guud," sed Amy critikaly.</p>

<p>"I knew it! I knew it! O mi Jo, I <em>am</em> so proud!" and Beth
ran to hug her sister, and exult oever this splendid success.</p>

<p>Deer me, how delieted thae all wer, to be shuur! how Meg
wouldn't beleev it till she saw th wurds, "Mis Josephine March,"
akchualy printing in th paeper; how graeshusly Amy criticised th artistik
parts of th story, and oferd hints for a seeqel, which unforchunatly
couldn't be carried out, as th heero and herroein wer ded;
how Beth got exsieted, and skipt and sung with joy; how Hannah
caem in to exclaem "Saeks aliev, wel I never!" in graet astonishment
at "that Jo's doin's;" how proud Mrs. March wuz when she
knew it; how Jo laft, with teers in her ies, as she declaerd she
miet as wel be a peacock and dun with it; and how th "Spred

of March, as th paeper past from hand to hand.</p>

<p>"Tel us all about it." "When did it cum?" "How much did U
get for it?" "Whut <em>wil</em> faather sae?" "Wun't Laurie laf?" cried
th family, all in wun breth, as thae clusterd about Jo; for thees foolish,
affectionate peepl maed a jubilee of every litl hous-hoeld joy.</p>

<p>"Stop jabering, gurls, and I'll tel U everything," sed Jo, wundering
if Mis Burney felt any grander oever her "Evelina" than she
did oever her "Rieval Paenters." Having toeld how she dispoezd of
her taels, Jo aded, "And when I went to get mi anser, th man
sed he liked them boeth, but didn't pae beginers, oenly let them
print in his paeper, and noetist th storys. It wuz guud praktis, he
sed; and when th beginers improovd, any wun wuud pae. So I
let him hav th too storys, and to-dae this wuz sent to me, and Laurie
caut me with it, and insisted on seeing it, so I let him; and he
sed it wuz guud, and I shal riet mor, and he's going to get th
next paed for, and I <em>am</em> so hapy, for in tiem I mae be aebl to suport
mieself and help th gurls."</p>

<p>Jo's breth gaev out heer; and, raping her hed in th paeper,
she bedewed her litl story with a fue nacheral teers; for to be independent,
and urn th praez of thoes she luvd wer th deerest
wishes of her hart, and this seemd to be th furst step tord that
hapy end.</p>

<p>
<span class="smc">"November</span> is th moest disagreeabl
munth in th hoel yeer," sed Margaret,
standing at th windo wun
dul afternoon, luuking out at th
frost-bitten garden.</p>

<p>"That's th reezon I wuz born in
it," obzurvd Jo pensivly, qiet unconshus
of th blot on her noez.</p>

<p>"If sumthing verry plezant should
hapen now, we should think it a delietful
munth," sed Beth, hoo tuuk
a hoepful vue of everything, eeven
November.</p>

<p>"I daer sae; but nuthing plezant
ever <em>duz</em> hapen in this family," sed
Meg, hoo wuz out of sorts. "We go
grubing along dae after dae, without
a bit of chaenj, and verry litl fun.
We miet as wel be in a tredmil."</p>

<p>"Mi paeshenss, how bloo we ar!"
cried Jo. "I don't much wunder,
puur deer, for U see uther gurls having
splendid times, whiel U griend,
griend, yeer in and yeer out. O, don't
I wish I cuud manej things for U
as I do for mi herroeins! U're
prity enough and guud enough aulredy, so I'd hav sum rich relaeshon
leev U a forchun unexpectedly; then U'd dash out as an
<span class="pagenum2">196</span>
aeres, scorn every wun hoo has slieted U, go abraud, and cum
hoem mi Laedy Sumthing, in a blaez of splendor and eleganss."</p>

<p>"Peepl don't hav forchuns left them in that stiel now-a-daes;
men hav to wurk, and wimen to marry for muny. It's a dredfuly
unjust wurld," sed Meg biterly.</p>

<p>"Jo and I ar going to maek forchuns for U all; just waet ten
yeers, and see if we don't," sed Amy, hoo sat in a corner, maeking
mud pies, as Hannah called her litl clay models of burds, froot, and
faeses.</p>

<p>"Can't waet, and I'm afraed I haeven't much faeth in ink and durt,
tho I'm graetful for yuur guud intenshons."</p>

<p>Meg sighed, and turnd to th frost-bitten garden again; Jo groend,
and leend boeth elboes on th taebl in a despondent atitued, but
Amy spatted away enerjetikaly; and Beth, hoo sat at th uther windo,
sed, smieling, "Too plezant things ar going to hapen riet
away: Marmee is cuming doun th street, and Laurie is tramping
thru th garden as if he had sumthing niess to tel."</p>

<p>In thae boeth caem, Mrs. March with her uezhual qeschon, "Any leter
from faather, gurls?" and Laurie to sae in his persuasive wae, "Wun't
sum of U cum for a driev? I've been wurking away at mathematiks
till mi hed is in a mudl, and I'm going to freshen mi wits
by a brisk turn. It's a dul dae, but th aer isn't bad, and I'm going
to taek Brooke hoem, so it wil be gae insied, if it isn't out. Cum,
Jo, U and Beth wil go, wun't U?"</p>

<p>"Of corss we wil."</p>

<p>"Much obliejd, but I'm busy;" and Meg whiskt out her wurk-basket,
for she had agreed with her muther that it wuz best, for her at
leest, not to driev ofen with th yung jentlman.</p>

<p>"We three wil be redy in a mienuet," cried Amy, runing away to
wosh her hands.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for U, Madam Muther?" askt Laurie, leening
oever Mrs. March's chaer, with th affectionate luuk and toen he
aulwaes gaev her.</p>

<p>"No, thank U, exsept call at th ofis, if U'll be so kiend, deer.
It's our dae for a leter, and th postman hasn't been. Faather is as
reguelar as th sun, but thaer's sum delae on th wae, perhaps."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">197</span>
A sharp ring interupted her, and a mienuet after Hannah caem in
with a leter.</p>

<p>"It's wun of them horrid telegraf things, mum," she sed, handing
it as if she wuz afraed it wuud exploed and do sum damej.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 391px;">

</div>

<p>At th wurd "telegraf," Mrs.
March snacht it, red th too
liens it contained, and dropt bak
into her chaer as whiet as if th litl
paeper had sent a bulet to her hart.
Laurie dasht doun staers for wauter,
whiel Meg and Hannah suported
her, and Jo red aloud, in a frietend
vois,—</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent smc">"Mrs. March:</p>

<p>"Yuur huzband is verry il.
Cum at wunss.</p>

<p class="sig2"><span class="padd-right2em">S. Hael,</span></p>
<p class="right no-space-top">"Blank Hospital, Washington"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How still th room wuz as thae
lisend breathlessly, how straenjly
th dae darkend outsied, and how
sudenly th hoel wurld seemd to
chaenj, as th gurls gatherd about
thaer muther, feeling as if all th
hapynes and suport of thaer lievs wuz about to be taeken from them.
Mrs. March wuz herself again direktly; red th mesej oever, and
strecht out her arms to her dauters, saeing, in a toen thae never
forgot, "I shal go at wunss, but it mae be too laet. O children,
children, help me to baer it!"</p>

<p>For several minits thaer wuz nuthing but th sound of sobing in
th room, minggld with broeken wurds of cumfort, tender assurances
of help, and hoepful whispers that died away in teers. Puur Hannah
wuz th furst to recuver, and with unconshus wizdom she set all th
rest a guud exampl; for, with her, wurk wuz th panacea for moest
aflikshons.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">198</span>
"Th Lord keep th deer man! I wun't waest no tiem a cryin',
but git yuur things redy riet away, mum," she sed, hartily, as she
wiept her faess on her apron, gaev her mistres a worm shaek of th
hand with her oen hard wun, and went away, to wurk liek three wimen
in wun.</p>

<p>"She's riet; thaer's no tiem for teers now. Be calm, gurls, and
let me think."</p>

<p>Thae tried to be calm, puur things, as thaer muther sat up, luuking
pale, but steady, and put away her greef to think and plan for them.</p>

<p>"Whaer's Laurie?" she askt prezently, when she had colekted
her thoughts, and desieded on th furst duties to be dun.</p>

<p>"Heer, maa'am. O, let me do sumthing!" cried th boy, hurying
from th next room, whither he had withdrawn, feeling that thaer
furst sorro wuz too saecred for eeven his frendly ies to see.</p>

<p>"Send a telegram saeing I wil cum at wunss. Th next traen goes
eerly in th morning. I'll taek that."</p>

<p>"Whut else? Th horses ar redy; I can go anywhere, do anything,"
he sed, luuking redy to fli to th ends of th urth.</p>

<p>"Leev a noet at Ant March's. Jo, giv me that pen and paeper."</p>

<p>Teering off th blank sied of wun of her nuely copyd paejes, Jo
droo th taebl befor her muther, wel noeing that muny for th
long, sad jurny must be borrowed, and feeling as if she cuud do
anything to ad a litl to th sum for her faather.</p>

<p>"Now go, deer; but don't kil yuurself drieving at a desperat paess;
thaer is no need of that."</p>

<p>Mrs. March's worning wuz evidently throen away; for fiev minits
laeter Laurie tore by th windo on his oen fleet horss, rieding as if for
his lief.</p>

<p>"Jo, run to th rooms, and tel Mrs. King that I can't cum. On
th wae get thees things. I'll put them doun; thae'll be needed,
and I must go prepaerd for nursing. Hospital stors ar not aulwaes
guud. Beth, go and ask Mr. Laurence for a cupl of botls of oeld
wien: I'm not too proud to beg for faather; he shal hav th best of
everything. Amy, tel Hannah to get doun th blak trunk; and,
Meg, cum and help me fiend mi things, for I'm haf bewildered."</p>

<p>Rieting, thinking, and direkting, all at wunss, miet wel bewilder th
<span class="pagenum2">199</span>
puur laedy, and Meg begd her to sit qieetly in her room for a litl
whiel, and let them wurk. Every wun scaterd liek leevs befor a
gust of wiend; and th qieet, hapy hous-hoeld wuz broeken up as sudenly
as if th paeper had been an eevil spel.</p>

<p>Mr. Laurence caem hurying bak with Beth, bringing every cumfort
th kiend oeld jentlman cuud think of for th invalid, and frendlyest
promises of protection for th gurls duuring th muther's absence,
which cumforted her verry much. Thaer wuz nuthing he didn't ofer,
from his oen dresing-goun to himself as escort. But that last wuz
imposibl. Mrs. March wuud not heer of th oeld jentlmans
undertaeking th long jurny; yet an expreshon of releef wuz vizibl
when he spoek of it, for anxiety il fits wun for travelling. He saw th
luuk, nit his hevy iebrows, rubd his hands, and marcht abruptly
away, saeing he'd be bak direktly. No wun had tiem to think of
him again till, as Meg ran thru th entry, with a paer of rubers in
<span class="pagenum2">200</span>
wun hand and a cup of tee in th uther, she caem sudenly upon
Mr. Brooke.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">
<a name="b085.png" id="b085.png"></a>
<img src="./LitlWimen_files/b085.png" width="454" height="400" alt="She came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke" title="She came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke">
</div>

<p>"I'm verry sorry to heer of this, Mis March," he sed, in th kiend,
qieet toen which sounded verry pleasantly to her perturbed spirit. "I
caem to ofer mieself as escort to yuur muther. Mr. Laurence has
comishons for me in Washington, and it wil giv me reeal satisfakshon
to be of survis to her thaer."</p>

<p>Doun dropt th rubers, and th tee wuz verry neer foloeing, as
Meg put out her hand, with a faess so fuul of gratitood, that Mr. Brooke
wuud hav felt re-paed for a much graeter sacrifiess than th trifling wun
of tiem and cumfort which he wuz about to maek.</p>

<p>"How kiend U all ar! Muther wil accept, I'm shuur; and it wil
be such a releef to noe that she has sum wun to taek caer of her.
Thank U verry, verry much!"</p>

<p>Meg spoek urnestly, and forgot herself entierly till sumthing in
th broun ies luuking doun at her maed her remember th cooling
tee, and leed th wae into th parlor, saeing she wuud call her
muther.</p>

<p>Everything wuz araenjd by th tiem Laurie returnd with a noet
from Ant March, enclosing th dezierd sum, and a fue liens repeeting
whut she had ofen sed befor,—that she had aulwaes toeld them it
wuz absurd for March to go into th army, aulwaes predikted that no
guud wuud cum of it, and she hoept thae wuud taek her advice
next tiem. Mrs. March put th noet in th fier, th muny in her
purss, and went on with her preparaeshons, with her lips foelded tightly,
in a wae which Jo wuud hav understuud if she had been thaer.</p>

<p>Th short afternoon wor away; all th uther errands wer dun,
and Meg and her muther busy at sum nesesaery 
<ins title="Change needlework to needle-work."> 
needl-wurk, whiel</ins>
Beth and Amy got tee, and Hannah finisht her ieerning with whut she
called a "slap and a bang," but still Jo did not cum. Thae began
to get anxious; and Laurie went off to fiend her, for no wun ever knew
whut freek Jo miet taek into her hed. He mist her, however, and
she caem wauking in with a verry qeer expreshon of countenanss, for
thaer wuz a mixcher of fun and feer, satisfakshon and regret, in it, which
puzzled th family as much as did th roel of bils she laed befor her
muther, saeing, with a litl choek in her vois, "That's mi contribution
<span class="pagenum2">201</span>
tords' maeking faather comfortable and bringing him
hoem!"</p>

<p>"Mi deer, whaer did U get it? Twenty-fiev dolars! Jo, I hoep
U haeven't dun anything rash?</p>

<p>"No, it's mien onestly; I didn't beg, borrow, or steal it. I
urnd it; and I don't think U'll blaem me, for I oenly soeld whut
wuz mi oen."</p>

<p>As she spoek, Jo tuuk off her bonnet, and a jeneral outcri aroez,
for all her abundant haer wuz cut short.</p>

<p>"Yuur haer! Yuur buetiful haer!" "O Jo, how cuud U?
Yuur wun buety." "Mi deer gurl, thaer wuz no need of this." "She
doesn't luuk liek mi Jo any mor, but I luv her deerly for it!"</p>

<p>As every wun exclaemd, and Beth hugd th cropt hed tenderly,
Jo asuemd an indiferent aer, which did not deseev any wun a
partikl, and sed, rumpling up th broun bush, and trieing to luuk as
if she liked it, "It doesn't affect th faet of th naeshon, so don't wael,
Beth. It wil be guud for mi vanity; I wuz geting too proud of mi
wig. It wil do mi braens guud to hav that mop taeken off; mi hed
feels deliciously liet and cool, and th barber sed I cuud soon hav
a curly crop, which wil be boyish, becuming, and eezy to keep in
order. I'm satisfied; so pleez taek th muny, and let's hav
super."</p>

<p>"Tel me all about it, Jo. <em>I</em> am not qiet satisfied, but I can't
blaem U, for I noe how wilingly U sacrifiest yuur vanity, as
U call it, to yuur luv. But, mi deer, it wuz not nesesaery,
and I'm afraed U wil regret it, wun of thees daes," sed Mrs.
March.</p>

<p>"No, I wun't!" returnd Jo stoutly, feeling much releevd that her
prank wuz not entierly condemd.</p>

<p>"Whut maed U do it?" askt Amy, hoo wuud as soon hav
thaut of cuting off her hed as her prity haer.</p>

<p>"Wel, I wuz wield to do sumthing for faather," replied Jo, as thae
gatherd about th taebl, for helthy yung peepl can eat eeven in th
midst of trubl. "I haet to borrow as much as muther duz, and I
knew Ant March wuud croek; she aulwaes duz, if U ask for a
ninepence. Meg gaev all her qorterly salary tord th rent, and I
<span class="pagenum2">202</span>
oenly got sum cloeths with mien, so I felt wiked, and wuz bound to
hav sum muny, if I soeld th noez off mi faess to get it."</p>

<p>"U needn't feel wiked, mi chield: U had no winter things,
and got th simplest with yuur oen hard urnestly," sed Mrs. March,
with a luuk that wormd Jo's hart.</p>

<p>"I hadn't th leest iedeea of seling mi haer at furst, but as I went
along I kept thinking whut I cuud do, and feeling as if I'd liek
to dive into sum of th rich stors and help mieself. In a barber's
windo I saw taels of haer with th prieses markt; and wun blak
tael, not so thik as mien, wuz forty dolars. It caem oever me all of a
suden that I had wun thing to maek muny out of, and without
stoping to think, I waukt in, askt if thae bought haer, and whut
thae wuud giv for mien."</p>

<p>"I don't see how U dared to do it," sed Beth, in a toen of aw.</p>

<p>"O, he wuz a litl man hoo luukt as if he meerly livd to oil his
haer. He rather staerd, at furst, as if he wasn't uezd to having gurls
bounss into his shop and ask him to bie thaer haer. He sed he
didn't caer about mien, it wasn't th fashonabl culor, and he never
paed much for it in th furst plaess; th wurk put into it maed it deer,
and so on. It wuz geting laet, and I wuz afraed, if it wasn't dun
riet away, that I shouldn't hav it dun at all, and U noe when
I start to do a thing, I haet to giv it up; so I begd him to taek it,
and toeld him whi I wuz in such a hurry. It wuz sily, I daer sae, but
it chaenjd his miend, for I got rather exsieted, and toeld th story in mi
topsy-turvy wae, and his wief hurd, and sed so kiendly,—</p>

<p>"'Taek it, Thomas, and obliej th yung laedy; I'd do as much
for our Jimy any dae if I had a spier of haer wurth seling.'"</p>

<p>"Hoo wuz Jimy?" askt Amy, hoo liked to hav things explaend
as thae went along.</p>

<p>"Her sun, she sed, hoo wuz in th army. How frendly such
things maek straenjers feel, don't thae? She taukt away all th tiem
th man clipt, and divurted mi miend niesly."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 431px;">

</div>

<p>"Didn't U feel dredfuly when th furst cut caem?" askt Meg,
with a shiver.</p>

<p>"I tuuk a last luuk at mi haer whiel th man got his things, and
that wuz th end of it. I never snivel oever trifles liek that; I wil
<span class="pagenum2">203</span>
confes, tho, I felt qeer when I saw th deer oeld haer laed out on
th taebl, and felt oenly th short, ruf ends on mi hed. It aulmoest
seemd as if I'd an arm or a leg off. Th wuuman saw me luuk at it,
and pikt out a long lok for me to keep. I'll giv it to U,
Marmee, just to remember past glorys by; for a crop is so comfortable
I don't think I shal ever hav a maen again."</p>

<p>Mrs. March foelded th waevy, chestnut lok, and laed it away with a
short grae wun in her desk. She oenly sed "Thank U, deary," but
sumthing in her faess maed th gurls chaenj th subjekt, and tauk as
cheerfuly as thae cuud about Mr. Brooke's kiendnes, th prospekt of
a fien dae to-morro, and th hapy times thae wuud hav when
faather caem hoem to be nurst.</p>

<p>No wun wontedw to go to bed, when, at ten o'clok, Mrs. March put
by th last finisht job, and sed, "Cum, gurls." Beth went to th
piano and plaed th faather's faevorit him; all began bravely, but
<span class="pagenum2">204</span>
broek doun wun by wun, till Beth wuz left aloen, singing with all her
hart, for to her muezik wuz aulwaes a sweet consoler.</p>

<p>"Go to bed and don't tauk, for we must be up eerly, and shal need
all th sleep we can get. Guud-niet, mi darlings," sed Mrs. March,
as th him ended, for no wun caerd to tri anuther.</p>

<p>Thae kist her qieetly, and went to bed as silently as if th deer
invalid lae in th next room. Beth and Amy soon fel asleep in spiet
of th graet trubl, but Meg lae awake, thinking th moest seerius
thoughts she had ever noen in her short lief. Jo lae moeshonles, and
her sister fansyd that she wuz asleep, till a stifled sob maed her
exclaem, as she tucht a wet cheek,—</p>

<p>"Jo, deer, whut is it? Ar U crieing about faather?"</p>

<p>"No, not now."</p>

<p>"Whut then?"</p>

<p>"Mi—mi haer!" burst out puur Jo, trieing vainly to smuther her
emotion in th pilo.</p>

<p>It did not sound at all comikal to Meg, hoo kist and caressed
th aflikted herroein in th tenderest maner.</p>

<p>"I'm not sorry," protested Jo, with a choek. "I'd do it again to-morro,
if I cuud. It's oenly th vaen, selfish part of me that goes
and cries in this sily wae. Don't tel any wun, it's all oever now. I
thaut U wer asleep, so I just maed a litl private moen for mi
wun buety. How caem U to be awake?"</p>

<p>"I can't sleep, I'm so anxious," sed Meg.</p>

<p>"Think about sumthing plezant, and U'll soon drop off."</p>

<p>"I tried it, but felt wieder awake than ever."</p>

<p>"Whut did U think of?"</p>

<p>"Handsum faeses,—ies particularly," anserd Meg, smieling to
herself, in th dark.</p>

<p>"Whut culor do U liek best?"</p>

<p>"Broun—that is, sumtiems; bloo ar luvly."</p>

<p>Jo laft, and Meg sharply orderd her not to tauk, then amiably
promist to maek her haer curl, and fel asleep to dreem of living in
her casl in th aer.</p>

<p>Th cloks wer strieking midniet, and th rooms wer verry still,
as a figuer glieded qieetly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlid heer,
<span class="pagenum2">205</span>
setling a pilo thaer, and pausing to luuk long and tenderly at eech
unconshus faess, to kis eech with lips that mutely blest, and to
prae th furvent praers which oenly muthers uter. As she lifted th
curten to luuk out into th dreery niet, th moon broek sudenly
from behind th clouds, and shone upon her liek a briet, benignant
faess, which seemd to whisper in th silence, "Be cumforted, deer
soel! Thaer is aulwaes liet behind th clouds."</p>

<p><span class="smc">In</span> th coeld grae daun th sisters lit thaer lamp, and red thaer
chapter with an urnestly never felt befor; for now th shado of
a reeal trubl had cum, th litl books wer fuul of help and cumfort;
and, as thae drest, thae agreed to sae guud-by cheerfuly and hoepfuly,
and send thaer muther on her anxious jurny unsaddened by
teers or complaents from them. Everything seemd verry straenj when
thae went doun,—so dim and still outsied, so fuul of liet and busl
within. Brekfast at that eerly our seemd od, and eeven Hannah's
familyar faess luukt unnacheral as she floo about her kichen with her
niet-cap on. Th big trunk stuud redy in th haul, muther's cloek
and bonnet lae on th soefa, and muther herself sat trieing to eat, but
luuking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that th

expreshon, as if sorro wuz a nue expeeri’enss to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">207</span>
Noebody taukt much, but as th tiem droo verry neer, and thae sat
waeting for th carrej, Mrs. March sed to th gurls, hoo wer all
busied about her, wun foelding her shaul, anuther smoothing out th
strings of her bonnet, a thurd putting on her oevershoos, and a foerth
fasening up her travelling bag,—</p>

<p>"Children, I leev U to Hannah's caer and Mr. Laurence's protection.
Hannah is faethfulnes itself, and our guud naebor wil
gard U as if U wer his oen. I hav no feers for U, yet I am
anxious that U should taek this trubl rietly. Don't greev and
fret when I am gon, or think that U can cumfort yuurselvs by
being iedl and trieing to forget. Go on with yuur wurk as uezhual, for
wurk is a blest solis. Hoep and keep busy; and whotever happens,
remember that U never can be faatherles."</p>

<p>"Yes, muther."</p>

<p>"Meg, deer, be proodent, woch oever yuur sisters, consult Hannah,
and, in any perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence. Be paeshent, Jo, don't get
despondent or do rash things; riet to me ofen, and be mi braev
gurl, redy to help and cheer us all. Beth, cumfort yuurself with
yuur muezik, and be faethful to th litl hoem duties; and U, Amy,
help all U can, be oebeedi’ent, and keep hapy saef at hoem."</p>

<p>"We wil, muther! we wil!"</p>

<p>Th ratl of an approaching carrej maed them all start and lisen.
That wuz th hard mienuet, but th gurls stuud it wel: no wun
cried, no wun ran away or uterd a lamentaeshon, tho thaer harts
wer verry hevy as thae sent luving mesejes to faather, remembering,
as thae spoek, that it miet be too laet to deliver them. Thae kist
thaer muther qieetly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to waev thaer
hands cheerfuly when she droev away.</p>

<p>Laurie and his grandfaather caem oever to see her off, and Mr. Brooke
luukt so strong and sensibl and kiend that th gurls crisend him
"Mr. Greatheart" on th spot.</p>

<p>"Guud-by, mi darlings! God bles and keep us all!" whisperd
Mrs. March, as she kist wun deer litl faess after th uther, and
huryd into th carrej.</p>

<p>As she roeld away, th sun caem out, and, luuking bak, she saw
it shiening on th groop at th gaet, liek a guud oemen. Thae saw it
<span class="pagenum2">208</span>
aulso, and smield and waevd thaer hands; and th last thing she beheld,
as she turnd th corner, wuz th foer briet faeses, and behind
them, liek a body-gard, oeld Mr. Laurence, faethful Hannah, and devoeted
Laurie.</p>

<p>"How kiend every wun is to us!" she sed, turning to fiend fresh
proof of it in th respektful simpathy of th yung man's faess.</p>

<p>"I don't see how thae can help it," returnd Mr. Brooke, lafing
so infectiously that Mrs. March cuud not help smieling; and so th
long jurny began with th guud oemens of sunshine, smiels, and
cheerful wurds.</p>

<p>"I feel as if thaer had been an urthqaek," sed Jo, as thaer naebors
went hoem to brekfast, leeving them to rest and refreshes themselvs.</p>

<p>"It seems as if haf th hous wuz gon," aded Meg forlornly.</p>

<p>Beth oepend her lips to sae sumthing, but cuud oenly pointer to th
piel of niesly-mended hoez which lae on muther's taebl, shoeing that
eeven in her last huryd moements she had thaut and wurkt for
them. It wuz a litl thing, but it went straet to thaer harts; and,
in spiet of thaer braev rezolooshons, thae all broek doun, and cried
biterly.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">209</span>
Hannah wiezly alowd them to releev thaer feelings, and, when
th shower shoed siens of cleering up, she caem to th rescue,
armd with a cofy-pot.</p>

<p>"Now, mi deer yung laedys, remember whut yuur maa sed, and
don't fret. Cum and hav a cup of cofy all round, and then let's
faul to wurk, and be a credit to th family."</p>

<p>Cofy wuz a treat, and Hannah shoed graet takt in maeking it
that morning. No wun cuud rezist her persuasive nods, or th fraegrant
invitaeshon ishooing from th noez of th cofy-pot. Thae droo
up to th taebl, exchanged thaer hankerchifs for napkins, and in
ten minits wer all riet again.</p>

<p>"'Hoep and keep busy;' that's th moto for us, so let's see hoo
wil remember it best. I shal go to Ant March, as uezhual. O, wun't
she lecture tho!" sed Jo, as she sipt with returning spirit.</p>

<p>"I shal go to mi Kings, tho I'd much rather stae at hoem
and atend to things heer," sed Meg, wishing she hadn't maed her
ies so red.</p>

<p>"No need of that; Beth and I can keep hous perfectly wel," put
in Amy, with an important aer.</p>

<p>"Hannah wil tel us whut to do; and we'll hav everything niess
when U cum hoem," aded Beth, geting out her mop and dish-tub
without delae.</p>

<p>"I think anxiety is verry interesting," obzurvd Amy, eating sugar,
pensivly.</p>

<p>Th gurls couldn't help lafing, and felt beter for it, tho Meg
shuuk her hed at th yung laedy hoo cuud fiend consolaeshon in a
sugar-boel.</p>

<p>Th siet of th 
<ins title="Change turnovers to turn-overs."> 
turn-overs maed Jo</ins> soeber again; and when th
too went out to thaer daily tasks, thae luukt sorroefuly bak at th
windo whaer thae wer accustomed to see thaer muther's faess. It
wuz gon; but Beth had rememberd th litl hous-hoeld serremoeny,
and thaer she wuz, noding away at them liek a roezy-faest mandarin.</p>

<p>"That's so liek mi Beth!" sed Jo, waeving her hat, with a graetful
faess. "Guud-by, Meggy; I hoep th Kings wun't traen to-dae.
Don't fret about faather, deer," she aded, as thae parted.</p>

<p>"And I hoep Ant March wun't croek. Yuur haer <em>is</em> becuming,
<span class="pagenum2">210</span>
and it luuks verry boyish and niess," returnd Meg, trieing not to smiel
at th curly hed, which luukt comikaly small on her taul sister's
shoulders.</p>

<p>"That's mi oenly cumfort;" and, tuching her hat <i>à laa</i> Laurie,
away went Jo, feeling liek a shorn sheep on a wintry dae.</p>

<p>Nues from thaer faather cumforted th gurls verry much; for, tho
dangerously il, th presence of th best and tenderest of nurses had
aulredy dun him guud. Mr. Brooke sent a buletin every dae, and,
as th hed of th family, Meg insisted on reeding th despaches,
which groo mor and mor cheering as th week past. At furst,
every wun wuz eeger to riet, and plump envelopes wer carefully
poekt into th leter-box by wun or uther of th sisters, hoo felt
rather important with thaer Washington corespondenss. As wun of
thees pakets contained carrakteristik noets from th party, we wil
rob an imajinarry mael, and red them:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent smc">"Mi Deerest Muther,—</p>

<p>"It is imposibl to tel U how hapy yuur last leter maed us,

business detaens him neer U so long, sinss he is so uesful to
U and faather. Th gurls ar all as guud as goeld. Jo helps me with
th soeing, and insists on dooing all sorts of hard jobs. I should be
afraed she miet oeverdo, if I didn't noe that her 'moral fit' wouldn't
last long. Beth is as reguelar about her tasks as a clok, and never
forgets whut U toeld her. She greevs about faather, and luuks soeber
exsept when she is at her litl piano. Amy miends me niesly, and I
taek graet caer of her. She duz her oen haer, and I am teeching
her to maek buton-hoels and mend her stokings. She tries verry
hard, and I noe U wil be pleezd with her improovment when
U cum. Mr. Laurence woches oever us liek a mutherly oeld hen,
as Jo sez; and Laurie is verry kiend and naeborly. He and Jo
keep us merry, for we get prity bloo sumtiems, and feel liek orfans,
with U so far away. Hannah is a perfect saent; she duz
not scoeld at all, and aulwaes calls me Mis 'Margaret,' which is qiet
proper, U noe, and treats me with respekt. We ar all wel and

to us; but I cuud oenly cri, and sae, 'I'm glad! I'm glad!' Didn't
that do as wel as a reguelar praer? for I felt a graet meny in mi

every wun is so desperatly guud, it's liek living in a nest of turtle-duvs.
U'd laf to see Meg hed th taebl and tri to be motherish.
She gets prityer every dae, and I'm in luv with her sumtiems.
Th children ar reguelar archaenjels, and I—wel, I'm Jo, and never

he wuz ofended. I wuz riet, but didn't speek as I aut, and he
marcht hoem, saeing he wouldn't cum again till I begd pardon.
I declaerd I wouldn't, and got mad. It lasted all dae; I felt
bad, and wontedw U verry much. Laurie and I ar boeth so proud,
it's hard to beg pardon; but I thaut he'd cum to it, for I <em>wuz</em>
in th riet. He didn't cum; and just at niet I rememberd whut
U sed when Amy fel into th river. I red mi litl book, felt
beter, rezolvd not to let th sun set on <em>mi</em> angger, and ran oever to
tel Laurie I wuz sorry. I met him at th gaet, cuming for th saem

guud and comfortable again.</p>

<p>"I maed a 'pome' yesterdae, when I wuz helping Hannah wosh;

<p class="h2a">Litl Faethful.</p>

<p><span class="smc">For</span> a week th amount of vurchoo in th oeld hous wuud hav suplied
th naeborhuud. It wuz reealy amaezing, for every wun seemd
in a hevenly fraem of miend, and self-denieal wuz all th fashon.
Releevd of thaer furst anxiety about thaer faather, th gurls insensibly
relaxt thaer praiseworthy eforts a litl, and began to faul bak into
th oeld waes. Thae did not forget thaer moto, but hoeping and keeping
busy seemd to gro eezyer; and after such tremendous exertions,
thae felt that Endevor dezurvd a holidae, and gaev it a guud meny.</p>

<p>Jo caut a bad coeld thru neglekt to cuver th shorn hed
enough, and wuz orderd to stae at hoem till she wuz beter, for Ant
March didn't liek to heer peepl red with colds in thaer heds. Jo
liked this, and after an enerjetik rumej from garret to selar, subsided
on th soefa to nurss her coeld with arsenicum and books. Amy
found that houswurk and art did not go wel together, and returnd
to her mud pies. Meg went daily to her pupils, and soed, or thaut
she did, at hoem, but much tiem wuz spent in rieting long leters to
her muther, or reeding th Washington despaches oever and oever.
Beth kept on, with oenly sliet relapses into iedlnes or greeving. All
th litl duties wer faethfuly dun eech dae, and meny of her sisters'
aulso, for thae wer forgetful, and th hous seemd liek a clok hoos
penjulum wuz gon a-viziting. When her hart got hevy with longings
for muther or feers for faather, she went away into a surten
clozet, hid her faess in th foelds of a surten deer oeld goun, and maed
her litl moen and praed her litl praer qieetly by herself.
Noebody knew whut cheerd her up after a soeber fit, but every wun
felt how sweet and helpful Beth wuz, and fel into a wae of going to
her for cumfort or advice in thaer small affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">217</span>
All wer unconshus that this expeeri’enss wuz a test of carrakter;
and, when th furst exsietment wuz oever, felt that thae had dun wel,
and dezurvd praez. So thae did; but thaer mistaek wuz in seesing
to do wel, and thae lurnd this leson thru much anxiety and
regret.</p>

<p>"Meg, I wish U'd go and see th Hummels; U noe muther
toeld us not to forget them," sed Beth, ten daes after Mrs. March's
deparcher.</p>

<p>"I'm too tierd to go this afternoon," replied Meg, roking comfortably
as she soed.</p>

<p>"Can't U, Jo?" askt Beth.</p>

<p>"Too stormy for me with mi coeld."</p>

<p>"I thaut it wuz aulmoest wel."</p>

<p>"It's wel enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not wel
enough to go to th Hummels'," sed Jo, lafing, but luuking a litl
ashamed of her inconsistency.</p>

<p>"Whi don't U go yuurself?" askt Meg.</p>

<p>"I <em>hav</em> been every dae, but th baeby is sik, and I don't noe
whut to do for it. Mrs. Hummel goes away to wurk, and Lottchen
taeks caer of it; but it gets siker and siker, and I think U or
Hannah aut to go."</p>

<p>Beth spoek urnestly, and Meg promist she wuud go to-morro.</p>

<p>"Ask Hannah for sum niess litl mes, and taek it round, Beth;
th aer wil do U guud," sed Jo, ading apolojetikaly, "I'd go,
but I wont to finish mi rieting."</p>

<p>"Mi hed aeks and I'm tierd, so I thaut mae be sum of U
wuud go," sed Beth.</p>

<p>"Amy wil be in prezently, and she wil run doun for us," sugjested
Meg.</p>

<p>"Wel, I'll rest a litl and waet for her."</p>

<p>So Beth lae doun on th soefa, th others returnd to thaer wurk,
and th Hummels wer forgoten. An our past: Amy did not
cum; Meg went to her room to tri on a nue dres; Jo wuz absorbd
in her story, and Hannah wuz sound asleep befor th kichen fier,
when Beth qieetly put on her huud, fild her basket with ods and
ends for th puur children, and went out into th chily aer, with a
<span class="pagenum2">218</span>
hevy hed, and a greevd luuk in her paeshent ies. It wuz laet when
she caem bak, and no wun saw her creep upstaers and shut herself
into her muther's room. Haf an our after Jo went to "muther's
clozet" for sumthing, and thaer found Beth sitting on th medisin
chest, luuking verry graev, with red ies, and a camfor-botl in her
hand.</p>

<p>"Christopher Columbus! Whut's th mater?" cried Jo, as Beth
put out her hand as if to worn her off, and askt qikly,—</p>

<p>"U've had th scarlet feever, haeven't U?"</p>

<p>"Whut baeby?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hummel's; it died in mi lap befor she got hoem," cried
Beth, with a sob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">219</span>
"Mi puur deer, how dredful for U! I aut to hav gon,"
sed Jo, taeking her sister in her arms as she sat doun in her muther's
big chaer, with a remorsful faess.</p>

<p>"It wasn't dredful, Jo, oenly so sad! I saw in a mienuet that it wuz
siker, but Lottchen sed her muther had gon for a doktor, so I tuuk
baeby and let Lotty rest. It seemd asleep, but all of a suden it gaev
a litl cri, and trembld, and then lae verry still. I tried to worm its
feet, and Lotty gaev it sum milk, but it didn't stur, and I knew it
wuz ded."</p>

<p>"Don't cri, deer! Whut did U do?"</p>

<p>"I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel caem with th doktor.
He sed it wuz ded, and luukt at Heinrich and Minna, hoo
hav got sor throets. 'Scarlet feever, maa'am. Aut to hav called
me befor,' he sed crosly. Mrs. Hummel toeld him she wuz puur, and
had tried to cuer baeby herself, but now it wuz too laet, and she cuud
oenly <ins title="Change ask him so help to ask him to help."> 
ask him to help th others,</ins> and trust to charrity for his pae. He
smield then, and wuz kiender; but it wuz verry sad, and I cried with
them till he turnd round, all of a suden, and toeld me to go hoem
and taek belladonna riet away, or I'd hav th feever."</p>

<p>"No, U wun't!" cried Jo, huging her cloez, with a frietend
luuk. "O Beth, if U should be sik I never cuud forgiv mieself!
Whut <em>shal</em> we do?"</p>

<p>"Don't be frietend, I ges I shan't hav it badly. I luukt in
muther's book, and saw that it begins with hedaek, sor throet, and
qeer feelings liek mien, so I did taek sum belladonna, and I feel
beter," sed Beth, laeing her coeld hands on her hot forhed, and
trieing to luuk wel.</p>

<p>"If muther wuz oenly at hoem!" exclaemd Jo, seezing th book,
and feeling that Washington wuz an imenss wae off. She red a
paej, luukt at Beth, felt her hed, peept into her throet, and then
sed gravely; "U've been oever th baeby every dae for mor than a
week, and amung th others hoo ar going to hav it; so I'm afraed
<em>U</em> ar going to hav it, Beth. I'll call Hannah, she noes all about
siknes."</p>

<p>"Don't let Amy cum; she never had it, and I should haet to giv
<ins title="Add period after her."> 
it to her.</ins> Can't U and Meg hav it oever again?" askt Beth,
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">220</span>
"I ges not; don't caer if I do; surv me riet, selfish pig, to let
U go, and stae rieting rubish mieself!" muterd Jo, as she went to
consult Hannah.</p>

<p>Th guud soel wuz wied awake in a mienuet, and tuuk th leed
at wunss, ashuuring Jo that thaer wuz no need to wury; every wun had
scarlet feever, and, if rietly treated, noebody died,—all of which Jo
beleevd, and felt much releevd as thae went up to call Meg.</p>

<p>"Now I'll tel U whut we'll do," sed Hannah, when she had
examind and qeschond Beth; "we wil hav Dr. Bangs, just to taek
a luuk at U, deer, and see that we start riet; then we'll send Amy
off to Ant March's, for a spel, to keep her out of harm's wae, and
wun of U gurls can stae at hoem and amuez Beth for a dae or too."</p>

<p>"I shal stae, of corss; I'm oeldest," began Meg, luuking anxious
and self-reproechful.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> shal, because it's mi fault she is sik; I toeld muther I'd do
th errands, and I haeven't," sed Jo decidedly.</p>

<p>"Which wil U hav, Beth? thaer ain't no need of but wun," sed
Hannah.</p>

<p>"Jo, pleez;" and Beth leend her hed against her sister, with a
contented luuk, which effectually setld that pointer.</p>

<p>"I'll go and tel Amy," sed Meg, feeling a litl hurt, yet rather
releevd, on th hoel, for she did not liek nursing, and Jo did.</p>

<p>Amy rebeld outriet, and pashonatly declaerd that she had rather
hav th feever than go to Ant March. Meg reezond, pleeded, and
comanded: all in vaen. Amy protested that she wuud <em>not</em> go; and
Meg left her in despaer, to ask Hannah whut should be dun. Befor
she caem bak, Laurie waukt into th parlor to fiend Amy sobing,
with her hed in th soefa-cuushons. She toeld her story, expecting to
be consoeld; but Laurie oenly put his hands in his pokets and waukt
about th room, whisling softly, as he nit his brows in deep thaut.
Prezently he sat doun besied her, and sed, in his moest wheedlesome
toen, "Now be a sensibl litl wuuman, and do as thae sae. No,
don't cri, but heer whut a joly plan I've got. U go to Ant
March's, and I'll cum and taek U out every dae, drieving or wauking,
and we'll hav capital times. Wun't that be beter than moeping

<p>"I don't wish to be sent off as if I wuz in th wae," began Amy,
in an injerd vois.</p>

<p>"Bles yuur hart, chield, it's to keep U wel. U don't wont to

<p>"No, I'm shuur I don't; but I daer sae I shal be, for I've been

<p>"That's th verry reezon U aut to go away at wunss, so that U

sae; or, if it duz not entierly, U wil hav th feever mor lietly.
I advise U to be off as soon as U can, for scarlet feever is no joek,

<p>"But it's dul at Ant March's, and she is so cros," sed Amy,
luuking rather frietend.</p>

<p>"It wun't be dul with me poping in every dae to tel U how

<p>"And go to th theeater, truly?"</p>

<p>"A duzen theeaters, if we mae."</p>

<p>"Wel—I ges—I wil," sed Amy sloely.</p>

<p>"Guud gurl! Call Meg, and tel her U'll giv in," sed Laurie,
with an aprooving pat, which anoyd Amy mor than th "giving

<p>Meg and Jo caem runing doun to behoeld th mirakl which had
been raut; and Amy, feeling verry precious and self-sacrifiesing,
promist to go, if th doktor sed Beth wuz going to be il.</p>

<p>"How is th litl deer?" askt Laurie; for Beth wuz his especial
pet, and he felt mor anxious about her than he liked to sho.</p>

<p>"She is lieing doun on muther's bed, and feels beter. Th baeby's
deth trubld her, but I daer sae she has oenly got coeld. Hannah
<em>sez</em> she thinks so; but she <em>luuks</em> wuryd, and that maeks me
fijety," anserd Meg.</p>

<p>"Whut a trieing wurld it is!" sed Jo, rumpling up her haer in a
fretful sort of wae. "No sooner do we get out of wun trubl than
doun cums anuther. Thaer doesn't seem to be anything to hoeld on
to when muther's gon; so I'm all at see."</p>

<p>"Wel, don't maek a porcupine of yuurself, it isn't becuming.
Setl yuur wig, Jo, and tel me if I shal telegraf to yuur muther, or
do anything?" askt Laurie, hoo never had been reconsield to th
lost of his frend's wun buety.</p>

<p>"That is whut trubls me," sed Meg. "I think we aut to tel
her if Beth is reealy il, but Hannah sez we mustn't, for muther can't
leev faather, and it wil oenly maek them anxious. Beth wun't be sik
long, and Hannah noes just whut to do, and muther sed we wer to
miend her, so I supoez we must, but it doesn't seem qiet riet to me."</p>

<p>"Hum, wel, I can't sae; supoez U ask grandfaather after th

<p><span class="pagenum2">223</span>
"We wil. Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at wunss," comanded Meg;
"we can't desied anything till he has been."</p>

<p>"Stae whaer U ar, Jo; I'm errand-boy to this establishment,"
sed Laurie, taeking up his cap.</p>

<p>"I'm afraed U ar busy," began Meg.</p>

<p>"No, I've dun mi lesons for th dae."</p>

<p>"He duz verry wel—for a boy," wuz Meg's sumwhot ungraeshus

</div>

<p><span class="smc">Beth</span> did hav th feever, and
wuz much siker than any wun
but Hannah and th doktor suspekted.
Th gurls knew nuthing
about ilnes, and Mr. Laurence
wuz not alowd to see her, so
Hannah had everything all her
oen wae, and busy Dr. Bangs
did his best, but left a guud
deel to th exselent nurss.
Meg staed at hoem, lest she
should infekt th Kings, and
kept hous, feeling verry anxious
and a litl guilty when she
roet leters in which no menshon
wuz maed of Beth's ilnes.
She cuud not think it riet to
deseev her muther, but she had
been bidden to miend Hannah,
and Hannah wouldn't heer of
"Mrs. March bein' toeld, and
wuryd just for sech a trifle."
Jo devoeted herself to Beth dae
and niet; not a hard task, for
Beth wuz verry paeshent, and bor her paen uncomplaeningly as long as she
cuud controel herself. But thaer caem a tiem when duuring th feever
fits she began to tauk in a horss, broeken vois, to plae on th cuverlet,
<span class="pagenum2">226</span>
as if on her beluved litl piano, and tri to sing with a throet so
swollen that thaer wuz no muezik left; a tiem when she did not noe
th familyar faeses round her, but adrest them by rong naems,
and called imploringly for her muther. Then Jo groo frietend,
Meg begd to be alowd to riet th trooth, and eeven Hannah sed
she "wuud think of it, tho thaer wuz no daenjer <em>yet</em>." A leter
from Washington aded to thaer trubl, for Mr. March had had a
relaps, and cuud not think of cuming hoem for a long whiel.</p>

<p>How dark th daes seemd now, how sad and loenly th hous,
and how hevy wer th harts of th sisters as thae wurkt and
waeted, whiel th shado of deth huverd oever th wunss hapy
hoem! Then it wuz that Margaret, sitting aloen with teers droping
ofen on her wurk, felt how rich she had been in things mor precious
than any luksherys muny cuud bie,—in luv, protection, peess, and
helth, th reeal blessings of lief. Then it wuz that Jo, living in th
darkend room, with that sufering litl sister aulwaes befor her ies,
and that pathetik vois sounding in her eers, lurnd to see th buety
and th sweetness of Beth's naechuur, to feel how deep and tender a
plaess she fild in all harts, and to aknolej th wurth of Beth's
unselfish ambishon, to liv for others, and maek hoem hapy by th
exercise of thoes simpl vurchoos which all mae possess, and which all
should luv and value mor than talent, welth, or buety. And
Amy, in her exile, longed eegerly to be at hoem, that she miet wurk
for Beth, feeling now that no survis wuud be hard or urksum, and
remembering, with regretful greef, how meny neglekted tasks thoes
wiling hands had dun for her. Laurie haunted th hous liek a
restles goest, and Mr. Laurence locked th grand piano, because he
cuud not baer to be remiended of th yung naebor hoo uezd to
maek th twilight plezant for him. Every wun mist Beth. Th
milkman, baeker, groeser, and butcher inqierd how she did; puur
Mrs. Hummel caem to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness, and to get
a shroud for Minna; th naebors sent all sorts of cumforts and
guud wishes, and eeven thoes hoo knew her best wer serpriezd to
fiend how meny frends shi litl Beth had maed.</p>

<p>Meenwhiel she lae on her bed with oeld Joanna at her sied, for eeven
in her waanderings she did not forget her forlorn 
<i>protégé</i>. She longed
<span class="pagenum2">227</span>
for her cats, but wuud not hav them brought, lest thae should get
sik; and, in her qieet ours, she wuz fuul of anxiety about Jo. She
sent luving mesejes to Amy, bade them tel her muther that she
wuud riet soon; and ofen begd for pensil and paeper to tri to
sae a wurd, that faather miet not think she had neglekted him. But
soon eeven thees intervals of conshusnes ended, and she lae our
after our, tosing to and fro, with incoeheerent wurds on her lips, or
sank into a hevy sleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr.
Bangs caem twice a dae, Hannah sat up at niet, Meg kept a telegram
in her desk all redy to send off at any mienuet, and Jo never
sturd from Beth's sied.</p>

<p>Th furst of December wuz a wintry dae indeed to them, for a biter
wiend blew, sno fel fast, and th yeer seemd geting redy for its
deth. When Dr. Bangs caem that morning, he luukt long at Beth,
held th hot hand in boeth his oen a mienuet, and laed it jently doun,
saeing, in a loe toen, to Hannah,—</p>

<p>"If Mrs. March <em>can</em> leev her huzband, she'd beter be sent for."</p>

<p>Hannah noded without speeking, for her lips twitched nurvusly;
Meg dropt doun into a chaer as th strength seemd to go out of
her lims at th sound of thoes wurds; and Jo, after standing with a
pale faess for a mienuet, ran to th parlor, snacht up th telegram,
and, throeing on her things, rusht out into th storm. She wuz
soon bak, and, whiel noizlesly taeking off her cloek, Laurie caem in
with a leter, saeing that Mr. March wuz mending again. Jo red it
thankfully, but th hevy waet did not seem lifted off her hart, and
her faess wuz so fuul of mizery that Laurie askt qikly,—</p>

<p>"Whut is it? is Beth wurss?"</p>

<p>"I've sent for muther," sed Jo, tuging at her ruber boots with
a tragical expreshon.</p>

<p>"Guud for U, Jo! Did U do it on yuur oen responsibility?"
askt Laurie, as he seeted her in th haul chaer, and tuuk off th
rebelyus boots, seeing how her hands shuuk.</p>

<p>"No, th doktor toeld us to."</p>

<p>"O Jo, it's not so bad as that?" cried Laurie, with a startld
faess.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is; she doesn't noe us, she doesn't eeven tauk about th
<span class="pagenum2">228</span>
floks of green duvs, as she calls th vien-leevs on th waul; she
doesn't luuk liek mi Beth, and thaer's noebody to help us baer it;
muther and faather boeth
gon, and God seems
so far away I can't fiend
Him."</p>

<p>As th teers streemd
fast doun puur Jo's
cheeks, she strecht
out her hand in a helples
sort of wae, as if
groeping in th dark, and
Laurie tuuk it in his,
whispering, as wel as he
cuud, with a lump in
his throet,—</p>

<p>"I'm heer. Hoeld on
to me, Jo, deer!"</p>

</div>

<p>She cuud not speek,
but she did "hoeld on,"
and th worm grasp
of th frendly hueman
hand cumforted her sor
hart, and seemd to
leed her neerer to th
Divine arm which aloen
cuud uphoeld her in her
trubl. Laurie longed
to sae sumthing tender
and comfortable, but no
fitting wurds caem to
him, so he stuud silent,
jently stroeking her bent hed as her muther uezd to do. It wuz th
best thing he cuud hav dun; far mor soothing than th moest eloquent
wurds, for Jo felt th unspoeken simpathy, and, in th silence,
lurnd th sweet solis which affection administers to sorro. Soon
<span class="pagenum2">229</span>
she dried th teers which had releevd her, and luukt up with a
graetful faess.</p>

<p>"Thank U, Teddy, I'm beter now; I don't feel so forlorn, and
wil tri to baer it if it cums."</p>

<p>"Keep hoeping for th best; that wil help U, Jo. Soon yuur
muther wil be heer, and then everything wil be riet."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad faather is beter; now she wun't feel so bad about
leeving him. O, me! it duz seem as if all th trubls caem in a
heep, and I got th hevyest part on mi shoulders," sighed Jo, spreding
her wet hankerchif oever her nees to dri.</p>

<p>"Doesn't Meg puul faer?" askt Laurie, luuking indignant.</p>

<p>"O, yes; she tries to, but she can't luv Bethy as I do; and she
wun't mis her as I shal. Beth is mi conshenss, and I <em>can't</em> giv
her up. I can't! I can't!"</p>

<p>Doun went Jo's faess into th wet hankerchif, and she cried
despaeringly; for she had kept up bravely till now, and never shed a
teer. Laurie droo his hand acros his ies, but cuud not speek till
he had subdued th choky feeling in his throet and steadied his
lips. It miet be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am glad
of it. Prezently, as Jo's sobs qieeted, he sed hoepfuly, "I don't
think she wil die; she's so guud, and we all luv her so much, I
don't beleev God wil taek her away yet."</p>

<p>"Th guud and deer peepl aulwaes do die," groend Jo, but she
stopt crieing, for her frend's wurds cheerd her up, in spiet of her
oen doubts and feers.</p>

<p>"Puur gurl, U're worn out. It isn't liek U to be forlorn.
Stop a bit; I'll harten U up in a jiffy."</p>

<p>Laurie went off too staers at a tiem, and Jo laed her wearied hed
doun on Beth's litl broun huud, which no wun had thaut of
mooving from th taebl whaer she left it. It must hav possessed
sum majik, for th submissive spirit of its jentl oener seemd to
enter into Jo; and, when Laurie caem runing doun with a glas of
wien, she tuuk it with a smiel, and sed bravely, "I drink—Helth
to mi Beth! U ar a guud doktor, Teddy, and <em>such</em> a comfortable
frend; how can I ever pae U?" she aded, as th wien refresht
her body, as th kiend wurds had dun her trubld miend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">230</span>
"I'll send in mi bil, by and by; and to-niet I'll giv U sumthing
that wil worm th cokls of yuur hart beter than qorts of
wien," sed Laurie, beeming at her with a faess of suprest satisfakshon
at sumthing.</p>

<p>"Whut is it?" cried Jo, forgeting her woes for a mienuet, in her
wunder.</p>

<p>"I telegraft to yuur muther yesterdae, and Brooke anserd
she'd cum at wunss, and she'll be heer to-niet, and everything wil
be all riet. Aren't U glad I did it?"</p>

<p>Laurie spoek verry fast, and turnd red and exsieted all in a mienuet,
for he had kept his plot a seecret, for feer of disapointing th gurls or
harming Beth. Jo groo qiet whiet, floo out of her chaer, and th
moement he stopt speeking she electrified him by throeing her
arms round his nek, and crieing out, with a joyful cri, "O Laurie!
O muther! I <em>am</em> so glad!" She did not weep again, but laft
histerrikaly, and trembld and clung to her frend as if she wuz a litl
bewildered by th suden nues. Laurie, tho decidedly amaezd,
behaevd with graet presence of miend; he pated her bak soothingly,
and, fiending that she wuz recuvering, foloed it up by a bashful kis
or too, which brought Jo round at wunss. Hoelding on to th banisters,
she put him jently away, saeing breathlessly, "O, don't! I
didn't meen to; it wuz dredful of me; but U wer such a deer to
go and do it in spiet of Hannah that I couldn't help flieing at U.
Tel me all about it, and don't giv me wien again; it maeks me akt so."</p>

<p>"I don't miend," laft Laurie, as he setld his tie. "Whi,
U see I got fijety, and so did grandpa. We thaut Hannah wuz
oeverdooing th authority business, and yuur muther aut to noe.
She'd never forgiv us if Beth—wel, if anything happened, U
noe. So I got grandpa to sae it wuz hie tiem we did sumthing,
and off I pelted to th ofis yesterdae, for th doktor luukt soeber,
and Hannah moest tuuk mi hed off when I propoezd a telegram. I
never <em>can</em> baer to be 'lorded oever;' so that setld mi miend, and
I did it. Yuur muther wil cum, I noe, and th laet traen is in at
too, <span class="smc">a.m.</span> I shal go for her; and U've oenly got to botl up yuur
rapcher, and keep Beth qieet, till that blest laedy gets heer."</p>

<p>"Laurie, U're an aenjel! How shal I ever thank U?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">231</span>
"Fli at me again; I rather liek it," sed Laurie, luuking mischivus,—a
thing he had not dun for a fortniet.</p>

<p>"No, thank U. I'll do it by proxy, when yuur grandpa cums.
Don't teez, but go hoem and rest, for U'll be up haf th niet.
Bles U, Teddy, bles U!"</p>

<p>Jo had bakt into a corner; and, as she finisht her speech, she
vanisht precipitately into th kichen, whaer she sat doun upon a
dreser, and toeld th asembld cats that she wuz "hapy, o, <em>so</em>
hapy!" whiel Laurie departed, feeling that he had maed rather a
neet thing of it.</p>

<p>"That's th interferingest chap I ever see; but I forgiv him, and
do hoep Mrs. March is cuming on riet away," sed Hannah, with an
aer of releef, when Jo toeld th guud nues.</p>

<p>Meg had a qieet rapcher, and then brooded oever th leter, whiel
Jo set th sik-room in order, and Hannah "nokt up a cupl
of pies in caess of company unexpekted." A breth of fresh aer
seemd to blo thru th hous, and sumthing beter than sunshine
brietend th qieet rooms. Everything apeerd to feel th
hoepful chaenj; Beth's burd began to churp again, and a haf-bloen
roez wuz discuverd on Amy's bush in th windo; th fiers seemd
to burn with uenuezhual cheeriness; and every tiem th gurls met, thaer
pale faeses broek into smiels as thae hugd wun anuther, whispering
encouragingly, "Muther's cuming, deer! muther's cuming!" Every
wun rejoist but Beth; she lae in that hevy stupor, aliek unconshus
of hoep and joy, dout and daenjer. It wuz a pitius siet,—th
wunss roezy faess so chaenjd and vaecant, th wunss busy hands so
week and waested, th wunss smieling lips qiet dum, and th wunss
prity, wel-kept haer scaterd ruf and tanggld on th pilo. All
dae she lae so, oenly rouzing now and then to muter, "Wauter!" with
lips so parched thae cuud hardly shaep th wurd; all dae Jo and
Meg huverd oever her, woching, waeting, hoeping, and trusting in
God and muther; and all dae th sno fel, th biter wiend raejd,
and th ours dragd sloely by. But niet caem at last; and every
tiem th clok struk, th sisters, still sitting on eether sied th bed,
luukt at eech uther with brietening ies, for eech our brought
help neerer. Th doktor had been in to sae that sum chaenj, for
<span class="pagenum2">232</span>
beter or wurss, wuud probably taek plaess about midniet, at which
tiem he wuud return.</p>

<p>Hannah, qiet worn out, lae doun on th soefa at th bed's fuut,
and fel fast asleep; Mr. Laurence marcht to and fro in th parlor,
feeling that he wuud rather faess a rebl batery than Mrs. March's
anxious countenanss as she entered; Laurie lae on th rug, pretending
to rest, but staering into th fier with th thautful luuk which
maed his blak ies beautifully soft and cleer.</p>

<p>Th gurls never forgot that niet, for no sleep caem to them as thae
kept thaer woch, with that dredful senss of powerlessness which
cums to us in ours liek thoes.</p>

<p>"If God spaers Beth I never wil complaen again," whisperd Meg
urnestly.</p>

<p>"If God spaers Beth I'll tri to luv and surv Him all mi lief,"
anserd Jo, with equal furvor.</p>

<p>"I wish I had no hart, it aeks so," sighed Meg, after a pause.</p>

<p>"If lief is ofen as hard as this, I don't see how we ever shal get
thru it," aded her sister despondently.</p>

<p>Heer th clok struk twelve, and boeth forgot themselvs in woching
Beth, for thae fansyd a chaenj past oever her waan faess. Th
hous wuz still as deth, and nuthing but th waeling of th wiend
broek th deep hush. Weery Hannah slept on, and no wun but th
sisters saw th pale shado which seemd to faul upon th litl bed.
An our went by, and nuthing happened exsept Laurie's qieet deparcher
for th staeshon. Anuther our,—still no wun caem; and
anxious feers of delae in th storm, or accidents by th wae, or, wurst
of all, a graet greef at Washington, haunted th puur gurls.</p>

<p>It wuz past too, when Jo, hoo stuud at th windo thinking how
dreery th wurld luukt in its wiending-sheet of sno, hurd a moovment
by th bed, and, turning qikly, saw Meg neeling befor thaer
muther's eezy-chaer, with her faess hiden. A dredful feer past
coeldly oever Jo, as she thaut, "Beth is ded, and Meg is afraed to
tel me."</p>

<p>She wuz bak at her poest in an instant, and to her exsieted ies a
graet chaenj seemd to hav taeken plaess. Th feever flush and th
luuk of paen wer gon, and th beluved litl faess luukt so pale
<span class="pagenum2">233</span>
and peaceful in its uter repoez, that Jo felt no dezier to weep or to
lament. Leening loe oever this deerest of her sisters, she kist th
damp forhed with her hart on her lips, and softly whisperd,
"Guud-by, mi Beth; guud-by!"</p>

<p>As if waekt by th stur, Hannah started out of her sleep, huryd to
th bed, luukt at Beth, felt her hands, lisend at her lips, and then,
throeing her apron oever her hed, sat doun to rok to and fro, exclaeming,
under her breth, "Th feever's turnd; she's sleepin'
nat'ral; her skin's damp, and she breeths eezy. Praez be given!
O, mi guudnes me!"</p>

<p>Befor th gurls cuud beleev th hapy trooth, th doktor caem to
confurm it. He wuz a hoemly man, but thae thaut his faess qiet
hevenly when he smield, and sed, with a faatherly luuk at them,
"Yes, mi dears, I think th litl gurl wil puul thru this tiem.
Keep th hous qieet; let her sleep, and when she waeks, giv her—"</p>

<p>Whut thae wer to giv, neether hurd; for boeth crept into th
dark haul, and, sitting on th staers, held eech uther cloez, rejoising
with harts too fuul for wurds. When thae went bak to be kist
and cudld by faethful Hannah, thae found Beth lieing, as she uezd
to do, with her cheek pillowed on her hand, th dredful palor gon,
and breething qieetly, as if just faulen asleep.</p>

<p>"If muther wuud oenly cum now!" sed Jo, as th winter niet
began to waen.</p>

<p>"See," sed Meg, cuming up with a whiet, haf-oepend roez, "I
thaut this wuud hardly be redy to lae in Beth's hand to-morro
if she—went away from us. But it has blossomed in th niet, and
now I meen to put it in mi vaess heer, so that when th darling waeks,
th furst thing she sees wil be th litl roez, and muther's faess."</p>

<p>Never had th sun rizen so beautifully, and never had th wurld
seemd so luvly, as it did to th hevy ies of Meg and Jo, as thae
luukt out in th eerly morning, when thaer long, sad vijil wuz dun.</p>

<p>"It luuks liek a faery wurld," sed Meg, smieling to herself, as she
stuud behind th curten, woching th dazling siet.</p>

<p>"Hark!" cried Jo, starting to her feet.</p>

<p>Yes, thaer wuz a sound of bels at th dor beloe, a cri from
Hannah, and then Laurie's vois saeing, in a joyful whisper, "Gurls,
she's cum! she's cum!"</p>

<p class="h2a">AMY'S Wil.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Whiel</span> thees things wer hapening at hoem, Amy wuz having hard
times at Ant March's. She felt her exile deeply, and, for th furst
tiem in her lief, reealiezd how much she wuz beluved and peted at
hoem. Ant March never peted any wun; she did not aproov of
it; but she ment to be kiend, for th wel-behaevd litl gurl pleezd
her verry much, and Ant March had a soft plaess in her oeld hart for
her nefue's children, tho she didn't think proper to confes it.
She reealy did her best to maek Amy hapy, but, deer me, whut mistaeks
she maed! Sum oeld peepl keep yung at hart in spiet of
rinkls and grae haers, can sympathize with children's litl caers
and joys, maek them feel at hoem, and can hied wiez lesons under
plezant plaes, giving and reseeving frendship in th sweetest wae.
But Ant March had not this gift, and she wuryd Amy verry much
with her rools and orders, her prim waes, and long, prosy tauks.
<span class="pagenum2">235</span>
Fiending th chield mor docile and aemiabl than her sister, th oeld
laedy felt it her duty to tri and counterakt, as far as posibl, th bad
efekts of hoem freedom and induljenss. So she tuuk Amy in hand,
and taut her as she herself had been taut sixty yeers ago,—a process
which carried dismae to Amy's soel, and maed her feel liek a
fli in th web of a verry strikt spieder.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;">
<a name="b099.png" id="b099.png"></a>
<img src="./LitlWimen_files/b099.png" width="470" height="400" alt="Polish up the spoons and the fat silver teapot" title="Polish up the spoons and the fat silver teapot">
</div>

<p>She had to wosh th cups every morning, and polish up th oeld-fashond
spoons, th fat silver teepot, and th glases, till thae shone.
Then she must dust th
room, and whut a trieing
job that wuz! Not
a spek escaept Ant
March's ie, and all th
furnicher had claw legs,
and much carving, which wuz
never dusted to suit. Then
Polly must be fed, th lap-dog coemd, and a duzen
trips upstaers and doun, to get things, or deliver orders,
for th oeld laedy wuz verry laem, and seldom left her big chaer. After
thees tiersum laebors, she must do her lesons, which wuz a daily trieal
of every vurchoo she possessed. Then she wuz alowd wun our for
exercise or plae, and didn't she enjoy it? Laurie caem every dae,
and wheedld Ant March, till Amy wuz alowd to go out with him,
when thae waukt and roed, and had capital times. After diner, she
had to red aloud, and sit still whiel th oeld laedy slept, which she
<span class="pagenum2">236</span>
uezhualy did for an our, as she dropt off oever th furst paej. Then
patchwork or towels apeerd, and Amy soed with outward meeknes
and inward rebelyon till dusk, when she wuz alowd to amuez
herself as she liked till tee-tiem. Th evenings wer th wurst of all,
for Ant March fel to teling long storys about her yooth, which wer
so unuterably dul that Amy wuz aulwaes redy to go to bed, intending
to cri oever her hard faet, but uezhualy going to sleep befor she had
sqeezd out mor than a teer or too.</p>

<p>If it had not been for Laurie, and oeld Esther, th maed, she felt
that she never cuud hav got thru that dredful tiem. Th parrot
aloen wuz enough to driev her distracted, for he soon felt that she
did not admier him, and revenjd himself by being as mischivus
as posibl. He puuld her haer whenever she caem neer him, upset
his bred and milk to plaeg her when she had nuely cleend his
caej, maed Mop bark by pecking at him whiel Madam doezd;
called her naems befor company, and behaevd in all respekts liek a
reprehensibl oeld burd. Then she cuud not enduur th dog,—a fat,
cros beest, hoo snarld and yelpt at her when she maed his toilet,
and hoo lae on his bak, with all his legs in th aer and a moest idiotik
expreshon of countenanss when he wontedw sumthing to eat,
which wuz about a duzen times a dae. Th cuuk wuz bad-temperd,
th oeld coachman def, and Esther th oenly wun hoo ever tuuk any
noetis of th yung laedy.</p>

</div>

<p>Esther wuz a Frenchwoman, hoo had livd with "Madame," as
she called her mistres, for meny yeers, and hoo rather tyrannized
oever th oeld laedy, hoo cuud not get along without her. Her reeal
<span class="pagenum2">237</span>
naem wuz Estelle, but Ant March orderd her to chaenj it, and she
oebaed, on condishon that she wuz never askt to chaenj her relijon.
She tuuk a fansy to Mademezel, and amuezd her verry much, with
od storys of her lief in France, when Amy sat with her whiel she
got up Madame's laeses. She aulso alowd her to roem about th
graet hous, and examine th cuerius and prity things stord away
in th big wardrobes and th ancient chests; for Ant March horded
liek a magpie. Amy's cheef deliet wuz an Indian cabinet, fuul of
qeer drawers, litl pijon-hoels, and seecret plaeses, in which wer
kept all sorts of ornaments, sum precious, sum meerly cuerius, all
mor or les anteek. To examine and araenj thees things gaev
Amy graet satisfakshon, especially th jooel-caeses, in which, on velvet
cuushons, repoezd th ornaments which had adornd a belle forty
yeers ago. Thaer wuz th garnet set which Ant March wor when
she caem out, th pearls her faather gaev her on her weding-dae, her
luver's diemonds, th jet morning rings and pins, th qeer lokets,
<span class="pagenum2">238</span>
with portraits of ded frends, and weeping wiloes maed of haer insied;
th baeby braeslets her wun litl dauter had worn; Unkl March's
big woch, with th red seel so meny chieldish hands had plaed with,
and in a box, all by itself, lae Ant March's weding-ring, too small
now for her fat fingger, but put carefully away, liek th moest precious
jooel of them all.</p>

<img src="./LitlWimen_files/b101.png" width="492" height="400" alt="I should choose this" title="I should choose this">
</div>

<p>"Which wuud Mademezel chooz if she had her wil?" askt
Esther, hoo aulwaes sat neer to woch oever and lok up th valueabls.</p>

<p>"I liek th diemonds best, but thaer is no neklas amung them,
and I'm fond of neklases, thae ar so becuming. I should chooz
this if I miet," replied Amy, luuking with graet admeraeshon at a
string of goeld and ebony beeds, from which hung a hevy cros of
th saem.</p>

<p>"I, too, cuvet that, but not as a neklas; ah, no! to me it is a roezary,
and as such I should uez it liek a guud Catholik," sed Esther,
ieing th handsum thing wistfuly.</p>

<p>"Is it ment to uez as U uez th string of guud-smeling wuuden
beeds hanging oever yuur glas?" askt Amy.</p>

<p>"Truly, yes, to prae with. It wuud be pleezing to th saents if
wun uezd so fien a roezary as this, insted of waering it as a vaen bijou."</p>

<p>"U seem to taek a graet deel of cumfort in yuur praers, Esther,
and aulwaes cum doun luuking qieet and satisfied. I wish I cuud."</p>

<p>"If Mademezel wuz a Catholik, she wuud fiend troo cumfort;
but, as that is not to be, it wuud be wel if U went apart eech dae,
to meditaet and prae, as did th guud mistres hoom I survd befor
Madame. She had a litl chapel, and in it found solacement for
much trubl."</p>

<p>"Wuud it be riet for me to do so too?" askt Amy, hoo, in her
loenlynes, felt th need of help of sum sort, and found that she wuz
apt to forget her litl book, now that Beth wuz not thaer to remiend
her of it.</p>

<p>"It wuud be exselent and charming; and I shal gladly araenj
th litl dresing-room for U if U liek it. Sae nuthing to Madame,
but when she sleeps go U and sit aloen a whiel to think
guud thoughts, and prae th deer God to prezurv yuur sister."</p>

<p>Esther wuz truly pious, and qiet sincere in her advice; for she
<span class="pagenum2">239</span>
had an affectionate hart, and felt much for th sisters in thaer anxiety.
Amy liked th iedeea, and gaev her leev to araenj th liet
clozet next her room, hoeping it wuud do her guud.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew whaer all thees prity things wuud go when Ant
March dies," she sed, as she sloely replaest th shiening roezary, and
shut th jooel-caeses wun by wun.</p>

<p>"To U and yuur sisters. I noe it; Madame confieds in me;
I witnest her wil, and it is to be so," whisperd Esther, smieling.</p>

<p>"How niess! but I wish she'd let us hav them now. Pro-cras-tee-naeshon
is not agreeabl," obzurvd Amy, taeking a last luuk at th
diemonds.</p>

<p>"It is too soon yet for th yung laedys to waer thees things. Th
furst wun hoo is affianced wil hav th pearls—Madame has sed it;
and I hav a fansy that th litl turquoise ring wil be given to U
when U go, for Madame aproovs yuur guud behaevyor and charming
maners."</p>

<p>"Do U think so? O, I'll be a lam, if I can oenly hav that
luvly ring! It's ever so much prityer than Kity Bryant's. I do
liek Ant March, after all;" and Amy tried on th bloo ring with a
delieted faess, and a furm rezolv to urn it.</p>

<p>From that dae she wuz a model of oebeedi’enss, and th oeld laedy
complacently admierd th success of her traening. Esther fited up
th clozet with a litl taebl, plaest a fuutstool befor it, and oever it
a pikcher taeken from wun of th shut-up rooms. She thaut it wuz
of no graet value, but, being aproepriat, she borrowed it, wel noeing
that Madame wuud never noe it, nor caer if she did. It
wuz, however, a verry valueable copy of wun of th faemus pikchers
of th wurld, and Amy's buety-luving ies wer never tierd of
luuking up at th sweet faess of th divine muther, whiel tender
thoughts of her oen wer busy at her hart. On th taebl she laed
her litl Testament and him-book, kept a vaess aulwaes fuul of th
best flowers Laurie brought her, and caem every dae to "sit aloen,
thinking guud thoughts, and praeing th deer God to prezurv her
sister." Esther had given her a roezary of blak beeds, with a silver
cros, but Amy hung it up and did not uez it, feeling doubtful as to
its fitnes for Protestant praers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">240</span>
Th litl gurl wuz verry sincere in all this, for, being left aloen outsied
th saef hoem-nest, she felt th need of sum kiend hand to hoeld
by so sorly, that she instinktivly turnd to th strong and tender
Frend, hoos faatherly luv moest cloesly serounds his litl children.
She mist her muther's help to understand and rool herself, but having
been taut whaer to luuk, she did her best to fiend th wae, and
wauk in it confidingly. But Amy wuz a yung pilgrim, and just now
her burden seemd verry hevy. She tried to forget herself, to keep
cheerful, and be satisfied with dooing riet, tho no wun saw or
praezd her for it. In her furst efort at being verry, verry guud, she
desieded to maek her wil, as Ant March had dun; so that if she
<em>did</em> faul il and die, her possessions miet be justly and jenerusly
divided. It cost her a pang eeven to think of giving up th litl
treasures which in her ies wer as precious as th oeld laedy's jooels.</p>

<p>Duuring wun of her plae-ours she roet out th important docuement
as wel as she cuud, with sum help from Esther as to surten
leegal turms, and, when th guud-naecherd Frenchwoman had siend
her naem, Amy felt releevd, and laed it by to sho Laurie, hoom she
wontedw as a second witnes. As it wuz a raeny dae, she went upstaers
to amuez herself in wun of th larj chaembers, and tuuk Polly with
her for company. In this room thaer wuz a wardrobe fuul of oeld-fashond
costumes, with which Esther alowd her to plae, and it
wuz her faevorit amuezment to arae herself in th faeded broekaeds,
and parade up and doun befor th long miror, maeking stately courtesies,
and sweeping her traen about, with a rusl which delieted her
eers. So busy wuz she on this dae that she did not heer Laurie's
ring, nor see his faess peeping in at her, as she gravely promenaded to
and fro, flurting her fan and tosing her hed, on which she wor a
graet pink turban, contrasting odly with her bloo broekaed dres and
yelo qilted petticoat. She wuz obliejd to wauk carefully, for she
had on hie-heeld shoos, and, as Laurie toeld Jo afterward, it wuz a
comikal siet to see her minss along in her gae suit, with Polly sidling
and bridling just behind her, imitaeting her as wel as he cuud,
and ocaezhonaly stoping to laf or exclaem, "Ain't we fien? Get
along, U friet! Hoeld yuur tung! Kis me, deer! Haa! haa!"</p>

<p>Having with dificulty restraend an exploezhon of merriment, lest it
<span class="pagenum2">241</span>
should ofend her majestys, Laurie tapt, and wuz graeshusly reseevd.</p>

<p>"Sit doun and rest whiel I put thees things away; then I wont to
consult U about a verry seerius mater," sed Amy, when she had
shoen her splendor, and driven Polly into a corner. "That burd is
th trieal of mi lief," she
continued, remooving th
pink mounten from her
hed, whiel Laurie seeted
himself astried of a chaer.
"Yesterdae, when ant
wuz asleep, and I wuz trieing
to be as still as a
mous, Polly began to
squall and flap about in his
caej; so I went to let him
out, and found a big spieder
thaer. I poekt it out, and
it ran under th bookcase;
Polly marcht straet after
it, stoopt doun and
peept under th bookcase,
saeing, in his funy
wae, with a cok of
his ie, 'Cum out
and taek a wauk, mi deer.' I <em>couldn't</em> help lafing, which maed
Poel swear, and ant woek up and scoelded us boeth."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">242</span>
"Did th spieder accept th oeld felo's invitaeshon?" askt Laurie,
yauning.</p>

<p>"Yes; out it caem, and away ran Polly, frietend to deth, and
scrambld up on ant's chaer, calling out, 'Cach her! cach her!
cach her!' as I chaest th spieder.</p>

<p>"That's a lie! O lor!" cried th parrot, pecking at Laurie's toes.</p>

<p>"I'd ring yuur nek if U wer mien, U oeld torment," cried
Laurie, shaeking his fist at th burd, hoo put his hed on wun sied, and
gravely croekt, "Allyluyer! bles yuur butons, deer!"</p>

<p>"Now I'm redy," sed Amy, shutting th wardrobe, and taeking a
paeper out of her poket. "I wont U to red that, pleez, and tel
me if it is leegal and riet. I felt that I aut to do it, for lief is unsurten
and I don't wont any il-feeling oever mi toom."</p>

<p>Th last naem wuz riten in pensil, and Amy explaend that he wuz
to re-riet it in ink, and seel it up for her properly.</p>

<p>"Whut put it into yuur hed? Did any wun tel U about Beth's
giving away her things?" askt Laurie soeberly, as Amy laed a bit of
red taep, with seeling-wax, a taeper, and a standish befor him.</p>

<p>She explaend; and then askt anxiously, "Whut about Beth?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I spoek; but as I did, I'll tel U. She felt so il
wun dae that she toeld Jo she wontedw to giv her piano to Meg, her
cats to U, and th puur oeld dol to Jo, hoo wuud luv it for her
saek. She wuz sorry she had so litl to giv, and left loks of haer to
th rest of us, and her best luv to grandpa. <em>She</em> never thaut of
a wil."</p>

<p>Laurie wuz siening and seeling as he spoek, and did not luuk up
till a graet teer dropt on th paeper. Amy's faess wuz fuul of trubl;
but she oenly sed, "Don't peepl put sort of 
<ins title="Change postscrips to postscripts."> 
postscripts to thaer wils,</ins> sumtiems?"</p>

<p>"Yes; 'codicils,' thae call them."</p>

<p>"Put wun in mien then—that I wish <em>all</em> mi curls cut off, 
and given round to mi frends. I forgot it; but I wont it dun, tho it 
wil spoil mi luuks."</p>

<p>Laurie aded it, smieling at Amy's last and graetest sacrifiess. Then
he amuezd her for an our, and wuz much interested in all her trieals.
But when he caem to go, Amy held him bak to whisper, with trembling
lips, "Is thaer reealy any daenjer about Beth?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraed thaer is; but we must hoep for th best, so don't cri,
<span class="pagenum2">245</span>
deer;" and Laurie put his arm about her with a brutherly jescher
which wuz verry cumforting.</p>

<p>When he had gon, she went to her litl chapel, and, sitting in th
twilight, praed for Beth, with streeming teers and an aeking hart,
feeling that a milyon turquoise rings wuud not consoel her for th
lost of her jentl litl sister.</p>

<p class="h2a">Confidenshal.</p>

<p>I <span class="smc">don't</span> think I hav any wurds in which to tel th meeting of th
muther and dauters; such ours ar buetiful to liv, but verry hard
to descrieb, so I wil leev it to th imajinaeshon of mi reeders,
meerly saeing that th hous wuz fuul of jenuein hapynes, and that
Meg's tender hoep wuz reealiezd; for when Beth woek from that long,
heeling sleep, th furst objekts on which her ies fel <em>wer</em> th litl
roez and muther's faess. Too week to wunder at anything, she oenly
smield, and nesld cloez into th luving arms about her, feeling that
th hunggry longing wuz satisfied at last. Then she slept again, and
th gurls waeted upon thaer muther, for she wuud not unclasp th thin
hand which clung to hers eeven in sleep. Hannah had "disht up"
an astonishing brekfast for th traveller, fiending it imposibl to vent
<span class="pagenum2">247</span>
her exsietment in any uther wae; and Meg and Jo fed thaer muther
liek dutiful yung storks, whiel thae lisend to her whisperd account
of faather's staet, Mr. Brooke's promis to stae and nurss him, th
delaes which th storm ocaezhond on th hoemward jurny, and th
unspeekabl cumfort Laurie's hoepful faess had given her when she
arrived, worn out with fateeg, anxiety, and coeld.</p>

<p>Whut a straenj, yet plezant dae that wuz! so brilliant and gae
without, for all th wurld seemd abraud to welcum th furst sno;
so qieet and reposeful within, for every wun slept, spent with woching,
and a Sabath stillness raend thru th hous, whiel noding
Hannah mounted gard at th dor. With a blissful senss of burdens
lifted off, Meg and Jo cloezd thaer weery ies, and lae at rest, liek
storm-beeten boets, saef at ancor in a qieet harbor. Mrs. March
wuud not leev Beth's sied, but rested in th big chaer, waeking ofen
to luuk at, tuch, and brood oever her chield, liek a miezer oever sum
recuverd treasure.</p>

<p>Laurie, meenwhiel, poested off to cumfort Amy, and toeld his story
so wel that Ant March akchualy "snift" herself, and never wunss
sed, "I toeld U so." Amy caem out so strong on this ocaezhon
that I think th guud thoughts in th litl chapel reealy began to baer
froot. She dried her teers qikly, restraend her impaeshenss to see
her muther, and never eeven thaut of th turquoise ring, when th
oeld laedy hartily agreed in Laurie's opinyon, that she behaevd "liek a
capital litl wuuman." Eeven Polly seemd imprest, for he called
her "guud gurl," blest her butons, and begd her to "cum and
taek a wauk, deer," in his moest affable toen. She wuud verry
gladly hav gon out to enjoy th briet wintry wether; but, discuvering
that Laurie wuz droping with sleep in spiet of manful eforts to
conceal th fakt, she persuaded him to rest on th soefa, whiel she
roet a noet to her muther. She wuz a long tiem about it; and,
when she returnd, he wuz strecht out, with boeth arms under his
hed, sound asleep, whiel Ant March had puuld doun th curtens,
and sat dooing nuthing in an uenuezhual fit of benignity.</p>

<p>After a whiel, thae began to think he wuz not going to waek till
niet, and I'm not shuur that he wuud, had he not been effectually
rouzd by Amy's cri of joy at siet of her muther. Thaer probably
<span class="pagenum2">248</span>
wer a guud meny hapy litl gurls in and about th sity that dae, but
it is mi private opinyon that Amy wuz th hapyest of all, when she
sat in her muther's lap and toeld her trieals, reseeving consolaeshon and
compensaeshon in th shaep of aprooving smiels and fond caresses.
Thae wer aloen together in th chapel, to which her muther did not
objekt when its purpos wuz explaend to her.</p>

<p>"On th contraery, I liek it verry much, deer," luuking from th
dusty roezary to th wel-worn litl book, and th luvly pikcher with
its garland of evergreen. "It is an exselent plan to hav sum plaess
whaer we can go to be qieet, when things vex or greev us. Thaer
ar a guud meny hard times in this lief of ours, but we can aulwaes
baer them if we ask help in th riet wae. I think mi litl gurl is
lurning this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, muther; and when I go hoem I meen to hav a corner in
th big clozet to put mi books, and th copy of that pikcher which
I've tried to maek. Th wuuman's faess is not guud,—it's too buetiful
for me to draw,—but th baeby is dun beter, and I luv it verry
much. I liek to think He wuz a litl chield wunss, for then I don't
seem so far away, and that helps me."</p>

<p>As Amy pointed to th smieling Christ-chield on his muther's nee,
Mrs. March saw sumthing on th lifted hand that maed her smiel.
She sed nuthing, but Amy understuud th luuk, and, after a mienuet's
pause, she aded gravely,—</p>

<p>"I wontedw to speek to U about this, but I forgot it. Ant gaev
me th ring to-dae; she called me to her and kist me, and put it
on mi fingger, and sed I wuz a credit to her, and she'd liek to keep
me aulwaes. She gaev that funy gard to keep th turquoise on, as
it's too big. I'd liek to waer them, muther; can I?"</p>

<p>"Thae ar verry prity, but I think U're rather too yung for such
ornaments, Amy," sed Mrs. March, luuking at th plump litl hand,
with th band of ski-bloo stoens on th forfingger, and th qaent
gard, formd of too tieny, goelden hands clasped together.</p>

<p>"I'll tri not to be vaen," sed Amy. "I don't think I liek it oenly
because it's so prity; but I wont to waer it as th gurl in th story
wor her braeslet, to remiend me of sumthing."</p>

<p>"Do U meen Ant March?" askt her muther, lafing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">249</span>
"No, to remiend me not to be selfish." Amy luukt so urnest and
sincere about it, that her muther stopt lafing, and lisend
respektfuly to th litl plan.</p>

<p>"I've thaut a graet deel laetly about mi 'bundle of naughties,'
and being selfish is th larjest wun in it; so I'm going to tri hard to
cuer it, if I can. Beth isn't selfish, and that's th reezon every wun
luvs her and feels so bad at th thoughts of loozing her. Peepl
wouldn't feel haf so bad about me if I wuz sik, and I don't dezurv
to hav them; but I'd liek to be luvd and mist by a graet
meny frends, so I'm going to tri and be liek Beth all I can. I'm
apt to forget mi rezolooshons; but if I had sumthing aulwaes about me
to remiend me, I ges I should do beter. Mae I tri this wae?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I hav mor faeth in th corner of th big clozet. Waer
yuur ring, deer, and do yuur best; I think U wil prosper, for th
sincere wish to be guud is haf th batl. Now I must go bak to
Beth. Keep up yuur hart, litl dauter, and we wil soon hav U
hoem again."</p>

<p>That evening, whiel Meg wuz rieting to her faather, to report th
traveller's saef arrival, Jo slipt up staers into Beth's room, and,
fiending her muther in her uezhual plaess, stuud a mienuet twisting her
finggers in her haer, with a wuryd jescher and an undecided luuk.</p>

<p>"Whut is it, deary?" askt Mrs. March, hoelding out her hand, with
a faess which invieted confidenss.</p>

<p>"I wont to tel U sumthing, muther."</p>

<p>"About Meg?"</p>

<p>"How qikly U guessed! Yes, it's about her, and tho it's
a litl thing, it fijets me."</p>

<p>"Beth is asleep; speek loe, and tel me all about it. That Moffat
hasn't been heer, I hoep?" askt Mrs. March rather sharply.</p>

<p>"No, I should hav shut th dor in his faess if he had," sed Jo,
setling herself on th flor at her muther's feet. "Last sumer Meg
left a paer of gluvs oever at th Laurences', and oenly wun wuz returnd.
We forgot all about it, till Teddy toeld me that Mr. Brooke had it. He
kept it in his waestcoet poket, and wunss it fel out, and Teddy joekt
him about it, and Mr. Brooke oend that he liked Meg, but didn't
daer sae so, she wuz so yung and he so puur. Now, isn't it a
<em>dred</em>ful staet of things?"</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">250</span>
"Do U think Meg caers for him?" askt Mrs. March, with an
anxious luuk.</p>

<p>"Mursy me! I don't noe anything about luv and such nonsenss!"
cried Jo, with a funy mixcher of interest and contempt.
"In novels, th gurls sho it by starting and blushing, faenting away,
groeing thin, and akting liek fools. Now Meg duz not do anything
of th sort: she eets and drinks and sleeps, liek a sensibl creecher:
she luuks straet in mi faess when I tauk about that man, and oenly
blushes a litl bit when Teddy joeks about luvers. I forbid him to
do it, but he doesn't miend me as he aut."</p>

<p>"Then U fansy that Meg is <em>not</em> interested in John?"</p>

<p>"Hoo?" cried Jo, staering.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brooke. I call him 'John' now; we fel into th wae of
dooing so at th hospital, and he lieks it."</p>

<p>"O, deer! I noe U'll taek his part: he's been guud to faather,
and U wun't send him away, but let Meg marry him, if she wonts
to. Meen thing! to go peting papa and helping U, just to wheedl
U into lieking him;" and Jo puuld her haer again with a rathful
tweak.</p>

<p>"Mi deer, don't get anggry about it, and I wil tel U how it happened.
John went with me at Mr. Laurence's reqest, and wuz so
devoeted to puur faather that we couldn't help geting fond of him.
He wuz perfectly oepen and onorabl about Meg, for he toeld us he
luvd her, but wuud urn a comfortable hoem befor he askt her
to marry him. He oenly wontedw our leev to luv her and wurk
for her, and th riet to maek her luv him if he cuud. He is a
truly exselent yung man, and we cuud not refuez to lisen to him;
but I wil not consent to Meg's engaejing herself so yung."</p>

<p>"Of corss not; it wuud be idiotik! I knew thaer wuz mischif
brewing; I felt it; and now it's wurss than I imajind. I just wish
I cuud marry Meg mieself, and keep her saef in th family."</p>

<p>This od araenjment maed Mrs. March smiel; but she sed
gravely, "Jo, I confied in U, and don't wish U to sae anything to
Meg yet. When John cums bak, and I see them together, I can
juj beter of her feelings tord him."</p>

<p>"She'll see his in thoes handsum ies that she tauks about, and
<span class="pagenum2">251</span>
then it wil be all up with her. She's got such a soft hart, it wil melt
liek buter in th sun if any wun luuks sentimentaly at her. She red
th short reports he sent mor than she did yuur leters, and pincht
me when I spoek of it, and lieks broun ies, and doesn't think John
an ugly naem, and she'll go and faul in luv, and thaer's an end of
peess and fun, and cosy times together. I see it all! thae'll go
lovering around th hous, and we shal hav to doj; Meg wil be
absorbd, and no guud to me any mor; Brooke wil scrach up a
forchun sumhow, carry her off, and maek a hoel in th family; and I
shal braek mi hart, and everything wil be abominably uncumfortabl.
O, deer me! whi weren't we all boys, then thaer wouldn't be
any bother."</p>

<p>Jo leend her chin on her nees, in a disconsolat atitued, and
shuuk her fist at th reprehensibl John. Mrs. March sighed, and Jo
luukt up with an aer of releef.</p>

<p>"U don't liek it, muther? I'm glad of it. Let's send him about
his business, and not tel Meg a wurd of it, but all be hapy together
as we aulwaes hav been."</p>

<p>"I did rong to sie, Jo. It is nacheral and riet U should all go
to hoems of yuur oen, in tiem; but I do wont to keep mi gurls as
long as I can; and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg is
oenly seventeen, and it wil be sum yeers befor John can maek a
hoem for her. Yuur faather and I hav agreed that she shal not biend
herself in any wae, nor be marryd, befor twenty. If she and John
luv wun anuther, thae can waet, and test th luv by dooing so. She
is conscientious, and I hav no feer of her treating him unkiendly.
Mi prity, tender-hearted gurl! I hoep things wil go hapily with
her."</p>

<p>"Hadn't U rather hav her marry a rich man?" askt Jo, as her
muther's vois faulterd a litl oever th last wurds.</p>

<p>"Muny is a guud and uesful thing, Jo; and I hoep mi gurls wil
never feel th need of it too biterly, nor be tempted by too much.
I should liek to noe that John wuz furmly established in sum guud
business, which gaev him an incum larj enough to keep free from
det and maek Meg comfortable. I'm not ambishus for a splendid
forchun, a fashonabl pozishon, or a graet naem for mi gurls. If rank
<span class="pagenum2">252</span>
and muny cum with luv and vurchoo, aulso, I should accept them
graetfuly, and enjoy yuur guud forchun; but I noe, by expeeri’enss,
how much jenuein hapynes can be had in a plaen litl hous, whaer
th daily bred is urnd, and sum privations giv sweetness to th
fue plezhers. I am content to see Meg begin humbly, for, if I am
not mistaeken, she wil be rich in th possession of a guud man's hart,
and that is beter than a forchun."</p>

<p>"I understand, muther, and qiet agree; but I'm disapointed
about Meg, for I'd pland to hav her marry Teddy by and by,
and sit in th lap of lukshery all her daes. Wouldn't it be niess?"
askt Jo, luuking up, with a brieter faess.</p>

<p>"He is yungger than she, U noe," began Mrs. March; but Jo
broek in,—</p>

<p>"Oenly a litl; he's oeld for his aej, and taul; and can be qiet
groen-up in his maners if he lieks. Then he's rich and jenerus
and guud, and luvs us all; and <em>I</em> sae it's a pity mi plan is spoilt."</p>

<p>"I'm afraed Laurie is hardly groen up enough for Meg, and
aultogether too much of a wethercok, just now, for any wun to
depend on. Don't maek plans, Jo; but let tiem and thaer oen harts
maet yuur frends. We can't medl saefly in such maters, and had
beter not get 'roemantik rubish,' as U call it, into our heds, lest
it spoil our frendship."</p>

<p>"Wel, I wun't; but I haet to see things going all criss-cros and
geting snarld up, when a puul heer and a snip thaer wuud straeten
it out. I wish waering flat-ieerns on our heds wuud keep us from
groeing up. But buds wil be roezes, and kitens, cats,—mor's th
pity!"</p>

<p>"Whut's that about flat-ieerns and cats?" askt Meg, as she crept
into th room, with th finisht leter in her hand.</p>

<p>"Oenly wun of mi stoopid speeches. I'm going to bed; cum,
Peggy," sed Jo, unfoelding herself, liek an animaeted puzzle.</p>

<p>"Qiet riet, and beautifully riten. Pleez ad that I send mi
luv to John," sed Mrs. March, as she glanst oever th leter, and
gaev it bak.</p>

<p>"Do U call him 'John'?" askt Meg, smieling, with her inosent
ies luuking doun into her muther's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">253</span>
"Yes; he has been liek a sun to us, and we ar verry fond of him,"
replied Mrs. March, returning th luuk with a keen wun.</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that, he is so loenly. Guud-niet, muther, deer. It
is so inexpresibly comfortable to hav U heer," wuz Meg's qieet
anser.</p>

<p>Th kis her muther gaev her wuz a verry tender wun; and, as she
went away, Mrs. March sed, with a mixcher of satisfakshon and regret,
"She duz not luv John yet, but wil soon lurn to."</p>

<p class="h2a">LAURIE Maeks Mischif, AND JO Maeks Peess.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Jo's</span> faess wuz a study next dae, for th seecret rather waed upon
her, and she found it hard not to luuk misteerius and important.
Meg obzurvd it, but did not trubl herself to maek inqierys, for she
had lurnd that th best wae to manej Jo wuz by th law of contraries,
so she felt shuur of being toeld everything if she did not ask. She
wuz rather serpriezd, thaerfor, when th silence remaend unbroeken,
and Jo asuemd a patronizing aer, which decidedly aggravated Meg,
hoo in her turn asuemd an aer of dignified rezurv, and devoeted herself
to her muther. This left Jo to her oen devieses; for Mrs. March
had taeken her plaess as nurss, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuez
herself after her long confienment. Amy being gon, Laurie wuz her
<span class="pagenum2">255</span>
oenly refuej; and, much as she enjoyd his soesieety, she rather dreded
him just then, for he wuz an incorijibl teez, and she feerd he
wuud coex her seecret from her.</p>

<p>She wuz qiet riet, for th mischif-luving lad no sooner suspekted
a mistery than he set himself to fiend it out, and led Jo a trieing lief
of it. He wheedld, bribed, ridicueld, thretend, and scoelded;
affected indiferens, that he miet serpriez th trooth from her;
declaerd he knew, then that he didn't caer; and, at last, by dint of
perseverance, he satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr.
Brooke. Feeling indignant that he wuz not taeken into his tuetor's
confidenss, he set his wits to wurk to deviez sum proper retaliaeshon
for th sliet.</p>

<p>Meg meenwhiel had apparently forgoten th mater, and wuz
absorbd in preparaeshons for her faather's return; but all of a suden
a chaenj seemd to cum oever her, and, for a dae or too, she wuz
qiet unliek herself. She started when spoeken to, blushed when
luukt at, wuz verry qieet, and sat oever her soeing, with a timid,
trubld luuk on her faess. To her muther's inqierys she anserd
that she wuz qiet wel, and Jo's she silenced by beging to be let
aloen.</p>

<p>"She feels it in th aer—luv, I meen—and she's going verry fast.
She's got moest of th symptoms,—is twittery and cros, doesn't eat,
lies awake, and moeps in corners. I caut her singing that song
he gaev her, and wunss she sed 'John,' as U do, and then turnd as
red as a popy. Whotever shal we do?" sed Jo, luuking redy for
any mezhers, however vieolent.</p>

<p>"Nuthing but waet. Let her aloen, be kiend and paeshent, and
faather's cuming wil setl everything," replied her muther.</p>

<p>"Heer's a noet to U, Meg, all seeld up. How od! Teddy
never seels mien," sed Jo, next dae, as she distributed th contents
of th litl poest-ofis.</p>

<p>Mrs. March and Jo wer deep in thaer oen affairs, when a sound
from Meg maed them luuk up to see her staering at her noet, with a
frietend faess.</p>

<p>"Mi chield, whut is it?" cried her muther, runing to her, whiel Jo
tried to taek th paeper which had dun th mischif.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">256</span>
"It's all a mistaek—he didn't send it. O Jo, how cuud U do
it?" and Meg hid her faess in her hands, crieing as if her hart wuz
qiet broeken.</p>

<p>"Me! I've dun nuthing! Whut's she tauking about?" cried Jo,
bewildered.</p>

<p>Meg's mield ies kindld with angger as she puuld a crumpld noet
from her poket, and throo it at Jo, saeing reproechfuly,—</p>

<p>"U roet it, and that bad boy helpt U. How cuud U be
so rood, so meen, and crooel to us boeth?"</p>

<p>Jo hardly hurd her, for she and her muther wer reeding th noet,
which wuz riten in a peculiar hand.</p>

<p>"O, th litl vilan! that's th wae he ment to pae me for keeping
mi wurd to muther. I'll giv him a harty scoelding, and bring
him oever to beg pardon," cried Jo, burning to exsecuet imeediat
justis. But her muther held her bak, saeing, with a luuk she seldom
wor,—</p>

<p>"Stop, Jo, U must cleer yuurself furst. U hav plaed so meny
pranks, that I am afraed U hav had a hand in this."</p>

<p>"On mi wurd, muther, I haeven't! I never saw that noet befor,
and don't noe anything about it, as troo as I liv!" sed Jo, so
urnestly that thae beleevd her. "If I <em>had</em> taeken a part in it I'd
hav dun it beter than this, and hav riten a sensibl noet. I
should think U'd hav noen Mr. Brooke wouldn't riet such stuf
as that," she aded, scornfuly tosing doun th paeper.</p>

<p>"It's liek his rieting," faulterd Meg, compaering it with th noet in
her hand.</p>

<p>"O Meg, U didn't anser it?" cried Mrs. March qikly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did!" and Meg hid her faess again, oevercum with shaem.</p>

<p>"Heer's a scraep! <em>Do</em> let me bring that wiked boy oever to
explaen, and be lectured. I can't rest till I get hoeld of him;" and Jo
maed for th dor again.</p>

<p>"Hush! let me manej this, for it is wurss than I thaut. Margaret,
tel me th hoel story," comanded Mrs. March, sitting doun
by Meg, yet keeping hoeld of Jo, lest she should fli off.</p>

<p>"I reseevd th furst leter from Laurie, hoo didn't luuk as if he
knew anything about it," began Meg, without luuking up. "I wuz wuryd
at furst, and ment to tel U; then I rememberd how U liked
Mr. Brooke, so I thaut U wouldn't miend if I kept mi litl seecret
<span class="pagenum2">258</span>
for a fue daes. I'm so sily that I liked to think no wun knew; and,
whiel I wuz desieding whut to sae, I felt liek th gurls in books, hoo
hav such things to do. Forgiv me, muther, I'm paed for mi silliness
now; I never can luuk him in th faess again."</p>

<p>"Whut did U sae to him?" askt Mrs. March.</p>

<p>"I oenly sed I wuz too yung to do anything about it yet; that I
didn't wish to hav seecrets from U, and he must speek to faather. I
wuz verry graetful for his kiendnes, and wuud be his frend, but nuthing
mor, for a long whiel."</p>

<p>Mrs. March smield, as if wel pleezd, and Jo clapt her hands,
exclaeming, with a laf,—</p>

<p>"U ar aulmoest equal to Caroline Percy, hoo wuz a patern of
prudence! Tel on, Meg. Whut did he sae to that?"</p>

<p>"He riets in a diferent wae entierly, teling me that he never
sent any luv-leter at all, and is verry sorry that mi roegish sister, Jo,
should taek such libertys with our naems. It's verry kiend and respektful,
but think how dredful for me!"</p>

<p>Meg leend against her muther, luuking th imej of despaer, and
Jo trampt about th room, calling Laurie naems. All of a suden
she stopt, caut up th too noets, and, after luuking at them
cloesly, sed decidedly, "I don't beleev Brooke ever saw eether of
thees leters. Teddy roet boeth, and keeps yuurs to cro oever me
with, because I wouldn't tel him mi seecret."</p>

<p>"Don't hav any seecrets, Jo; tel it to muther, and keep out of
trubl, as I should hav dun," sed Meg warningly.</p>

<p>"Bles U, chield! Muther toeld me."</p>

<p>"That wil do, Jo. I'll cumfort Meg whiel U go and get Laurie.
I shal sift th mater to th bottom, and put a stop to such pranks at
wunss."</p>

<p>Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March jently toeld Meg Mr. Brooke's reeal
feelings. "Now, deer, whut ar yuur oen? Do U luv him enough
to waet till he can maek a hoem for U, or wil U keep yuurself qiet
free for th prezent?"</p>

<p>"I've been so scaerd and wuryd, I don't wont to hav anything
to do with luvers for a long whiel,—perhaps never," anserd Meg
petulantly. "If John <em>doesn't</em> noe anything about this nonsenss,
<span class="pagenum2">259</span>
don't tel him, and maek Jo and Laurie hoeld thaer tungs. I wun't
be deseevd and plaegd and maed a fool of,—it's a shaem!"</p>

<p>Seeing that Meg's uezhualy jentl temper wuz rouzd and her pride
hurt by this mischivus joek, Mrs. March soothd her by promises
of entier silence, and graet discreshon for th fuecher. Th instant
Laurie's step wuz hurd in th haul, Meg fled into th study, and Mrs.
March reseevd th culprit aloen. Jo had not toeld him whi he wuz
wontedw, feering he wouldn't cum; but he knew th mienuet he saw
Mrs. March's faess, and stuud twirling his hat, with a guilty aer which
convikted him at wunss. Jo wuz dismist, but choez to march up and
doun th haul liek a sentinel, having sum feer that th prizoner miet
bolt. Th sound of voises in th parlor roez and fel for haf an
our; but whut happened duuring that intervue th gurls never knew.</p>

<p>When thae wer called in, Laurie wuz standing by thaer muther,
with such a penitent faess that Jo forgaev him on th spot, but did
not think it wiez to betrae th fakt. Meg reseevd his humbl apolojy,
and wuz much cumforted by th assurance that Brooke knew
nuthing of th joek.</p>

<p>"I'll never tel him to mi dieing dae,—wield horses sha'n't drag it
out of me; so U'll forgiv me, Meg, and I'll do anything to sho
how out-and-out sorry I am," he aded, luuking verry much ashamed
of himself.</p>

<p>"I'll tri; but it wuz a verry ungentlemanly thing to do. I didn't
think U cuud be so sli and malishus, Laurie," replied Meg, trieing
to hied her maedenly confuezhon under a gravely reproechful aer.</p>

<p>"It wuz aultogether abominabl, and I don't dezurv to be spoeken
to for a munth; but U wil, tho, wun't U?" and Laurie foelded
his hands together with such an imploring jescher, as he spoek in his
irezistibly persuasive toen, that it wuz imposibl to froun upon him,
in spiet of his scandalus behaevyor. Meg pardoned him, and Mrs.
March's graev faess relaxt, in spiet of her eforts to keep soeber, when
she hurd him declaer that he wuud atone for his sins by all sorts of
penanses, and abaess himself liek a wurm befor th injerd damsel.</p>

<p>Jo stuud aloof, meenwhiel, trieing to harden her hart against him, and
succeeding oenly in primming up her faess into an expreshon of entier
disapprobation. Laurie luukt at her wunss or twice, but, as she
<span class="pagenum2">260</span>
shoed no sien of relenting, he felt injerd, and turnd his bak on
her till th others wer dun with him, when he maed her a loe boe,
and waukt off without a wurd.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gon, she wisht she had been mor forgiving;
and when Meg and her muther went upstaers, she felt loenly, and
longed for Teddy. After rezisting for sum tiem, she yeelded to th
impulss, and, armd with a book to return, went oever to th big
hous.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Laurence in?" askt Jo, of a housmaed, hoo wuz cuming
doun staers.</p>

<p>"Yes, mis; but I don't beleev he's seeable just yet."</p>

<p>"Whi not? is he il?"</p>

<p>"Laa, no, mis, but he's had a seen with Mr. Laurie, hoo is in wun
of his tantrums about sumthing, which vexes th oeld jentlman, so I
dursn't go nie him."</p>

<p>"Whaer is Laurie?"</p>

<p>"Shut up in his room, and he wun't anser, tho I've been a-taping.
I don't noe whut's to becum of th diner, for it's redy,
and thaer's no wun to eat it."</p>

<p>"I'll go and see whut th mater is. I'm not afraed of eether of
them."</p>

<p>Up went Jo, and nokt smartly on th dor of Laurie's litl
study.</p>

<p>"Stop that, or I'll oepen th dor and maek U!" called out th
yung jentlman, in a thretening toen.</p>

<p>Jo imeediatly nokt again; th dor floo oepen, and in she
bounst, befor Laurie cuud recuver from his serpriez. Seeing that
he reealy <em>wuz</em> out of temper, Jo, hoo knew how to manej him, asuemd
a contriet expreshon, and going artistikaly doun upon her
nees, sed meekly, "Pleez forgiv me for being so cros. I caem
to maek it up, and can't go away till I hav."</p>

<p>"It's all riet. Get up, and don't be a gooss, Jo," wuz th cavalier
replie to her petition.</p>

<p>"Thank U; I wil. Cuud I ask whut's th mater? U don't

<p>"I've been shaeken, and I wun't baer it!" grould Laurie indignantly.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">261</span>
"Hoo did it?" demanded Jo.</p>

<p>"Grandfaather; if it had been
any wun else I'd hav—" and
th injerd yooth finisht his sentenss
by an enerjetik jescher of
th riet arm.</p>

<p>"That's nuthing; I ofen shaek
U, and U don't miend," sed Jo
soothingly.</p>

<p>"Pooh! U're a gurl, and it's fun; but I'll alow no man to shaek
<em>me</em>."</p>

<p>"I don't think any wun wuud caer to tri it, if U luukt as much
liek a thunder-cloud as U do now. Whi wer U treated so?"</p>

<p>"Just because I wouldn't sae whut yuur muther wontedw me for.
I'd promist not to tel, and of corss I wasn't going to braek mi

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">262</span>
"Couldn't U satisfi yuur grandpa in any uther wae?"</p>

<p>"No; he <em>wuud</em> hav th trooth, th hoel trooth, and nuthing but
th trooth. I'd hav toeld mi part of th scraep, if I cuud without
bringing Meg in. As I couldn't, I held mi tung, and bor th
scoelding till th oeld jentlman collared me. Then I got anggry, and
bolted, for feer I should forget mieself."</p>

<p>"It wasn't niess, but he's sorry, I noe; so go doun and maek
up. I'll help U."</p>

<p>"Hangd if I do! I'm not going to be lectured and pummelled
by every wun, just for a bit of a frolik. I <em>wuz</em> sorry about Meg, and
begd pardon liek a man; but I wun't do it again, when I wasn't
in th rong."</p>

<p>"He didn't noe that."</p>

<p>"He aut to trust me, and not akt as if I wuz a baeby. It's no
uez, Jo; he's got to lurn that I'm aebl to taek caer of mieself, and
don't need any wun's apron-string to hoeld on by."</p>

<p>"Whut peper-pots U ar!" sighed Jo. "How do U meen
to setl this affair?"</p>

<p>"Wel, he aut to beg pardon, and beleev me when I sae I can't
tel him whut th fus's about."</p>

<p>"Bles U! he wun't do that."</p>

<p>"I wun't go doun till he duz."</p>

<p>"Now, Teddy, be sensibl; let it pas, and I'll explaen whut I can.
U can't stae heer, so whut's th uez of being melodramatik?"</p>

<p>"I don't intend to stae heer long, any wae. I'll slip off and taek
a jurny sumwhaer, and when grandpa mises me he'll cum
round fast enough."</p>

<p>"I daer sae; but U aut not to go and wury him."</p>

<p>"Don't preech. I'll go to Washington and see Brooke; it's gae
thaer, and I'll enjoy mieself after th trubls."</p>

<p>"Whut fun U'd hav! I wish I cuud run off too," sed Jo,
forgeting her part of Mentor in lievly vizhons of marshal lief at th
capital.</p>

<p>"Cum on, then! Whi not? U go and serpriez yuur faather,
and I'll stur up oeld Brooke. It wuud be a glorius joek; let's do it,
Jo. We'll leev a leter saeing we ar all riet, and trot off at wunss.
<span class="pagenum2">263</span>
I've got muny enough; it wil do U guud, and be no harm, as
U go to yuur faather."</p>

<p>For a moement Jo luukt as if she wuud agree; for, wield as th
plan wuz, it just suited her. She wuz tierd of caer and confienment,
longed for chaenj, and thoughts of her faather blended temptingly
with th novel charms of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun. Her
ies kindld as thae turnd wistfuly tord th windo, but thae fel
on th oeld hous opozit, and she shuuk her hed with sorroeful
desizhon.</p>

<p>"If I wuz a boy, we'd run away together, and hav a capital tiem;
but as I'm a mizerabl gurl, I must be proper, and stop at hoem.
Don't tempt me, Teddy, it's a craezy plan."</p>

<p>"That's th fun of it," began Laurie, hoo had got a wilful fit on
him, and wuz possessed to braek out of bounds in sum wae.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">264</span>
"Hoeld yuur tung!" cried Jo, cuvering her eers. "'Proons and

caem heer to moraliez, not to heer about things that maek me skip

<p>"I noe Meg wuud wet-blanket such a propoezal, but I thaut
U had mor spirit," began Laurie insinuatingly.</p>

<p>"Bad boy, be qieet! Sit doun and think of yuur oen sins, don't
go maeking me ad to mien. If I get yuur grandpa to apolojiez for
th shaeking, wil U giv up runing away?" askt Jo seeriusly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but U wun't do it," anserd Laurie, hoo wisht "to
maek up," but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased furst.</p>

<p>"If I can manej th yung wun I can th oeld wun," muterd Jo,
as she waukt away, leeving Laurie bent oever a raelroed map, with
his hed propped up on boeth hands.</p>

<p>"Cum in!" and Mr. Laurence's gruf vois sounded gruffer than
ever, as Jo tapt at his dor.</p>

<p>"It's oenly me, sur, cum to return a book," she sed blandly, as
she entered.</p>

<p>"Wont any mor?" askt th oeld jentlman, luuking grim and
vext, but trieing not to sho it.</p>

<p>"Yes, pleez. I liek oeld Sam so wel, I think I'll tri th second
voluem," returnd Jo, hoeping to propitiate him by accepting a second
doess of Boswell's "Johnson," as he had recomended that lievly
wurk.</p>

<p>Th shagy iebrows unbent a litl, as he roeld th steps tord
th shelf whaer th Johnsonian literachuur wuz plaest. Jo skipt up,
and, sitting on th top step, affected to be surching for her book, but
wuz reealy wundering how best to introduess th daenjerus objekt of
her vizit. Mr. Laurence seemd to suspekt that sumthing wuz brewing
in her miend; for, after taeking several brisk turns about th room,
he faest round on her, speeking so abruptly that "Rasselas" tumbld
faess dounward on th flor.</p>

<p>"Whut has that boy been about? Don't tri to sheeld him. I
noe he has been in mischif by th wae he akted when he caem
hoem. I can't get a wurd from him; and when I thretend to
shaek th trooth out of him he bolted upstaers, and locked himself into
his room."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">265</span>
"He did do
rong, but we forgaev
him, and all
promist not to sae a
wurd to any wun," began
Jo reluktantly.</p>

<p>"That wun't do; he
shal not shelter himself
behind a promis from U soft-hearted
gurls. If he's dun anything amis,
he shal confes, beg pardon, and be
punisht. Out with it, Jo, I wun't be kept in th dark."</p>

<p>Mr. Laurence luukt so alarming and spoek so sharply that Jo
wuud hav gladly run away, if she cuud, but she wuz purcht aloft
<span class="pagenum2">266</span>
on th steps, and he stuud at th fuut, a lieon in th path, so she had
to stae and braev it out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p>"Indeed, sur, I cannot tel; muther forbaed it. Laurie has confest,
askt pardon, and been punisht qiet enough. We don't keep
silence to sheeld him, but sum wun else, and it wil maek mor trubl
if U interfeer. Pleez don't; it wuz partly mi fault, but it's all
riet now; so let's forget it, and tauk about th 'Rambler,' or sumthing
plezant."</p>

<p>"Hang th 'Rambler!' cum doun and giv me yuur wurd that
this harum-scarum boy of mien hasn't dun anything ungraetful or
impurtinent. If he has, after all yuur kiendnes to him, I'll thrash
him with mi oen hands."</p>

<p>Th thret sounded auful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew th
irasibl oeld jentlman wuud never lift a fingger against his grandson,
whotever he miet sae to th contraery. She oebeedi’ently desended,
and maed as liet of th prank as she cuud without betraeing Meg or
forgeting th trooth.</p>

<p>"Hum—haa—wel, if th boy held his tung because he promist,
and not from obstinasy, I'll forgiv him. He's a stuborn
felo, and hard to manej," sed Mr. Laurence, rubing up his haer
till it luukt as if he had been out in a gael, and smoothing th froun
from his brow with an aer of releef.</p>

<p>"So am I; but a kiend wurd wil guvern me when all th king's
horses and all th king's men couldn't," sed Jo, trieing to sae a
kiend wurd for her frend, hoo seemd to get out of wun scraep oenly to
faul into anuther.</p>

<p>"U think I'm not kiend to him, hae?" wuz th sharp anser.</p>

<p>"O, deer, no, sur; U ar rather too kiend sumtiems, and then just
a trifle hasty when he tries yuur paeshenss. Don't U think U ar?"</p>

<p>Jo wuz deturmind to hav it out now, and tried to luuk qiet plasid,
tho she qaekt a litl after her boeld speech. To her graet
releef and serpriez, th oeld jentlman oenly throo his spektakls on to
th taebl with a ratl, and exclaemd frankly,—</p>

<p>"U're riet, gurl, I am! I luv th boy, but he tries mi paeshenss
past bearing, and I don't noe how it wil end, if we go on so."</p>

<p>"I'll tel U, he'll run away." Jo wuz sorry for that speech th
<span class="pagenum2">267</span>
mienuet it wuz maed; she ment to worn him that Laurie wuud not baer
much restraent, and hoept he wuud be mor forbearing with th lad.</p>

<p>Mr. Laurence's rudy faess chaenjd sudenly, and he sat doun,
with a trubld glanss at th pikcher of a handsum man, which hung
oever his taebl. It wuz Laurie's faather, hoo <em>had</em> run away in his yooth,
and marryd against th impeerius oeld man's wil. Jo fansyd he rememberd
and regreted th past, and she wisht she had held her
tung.</p>

<p>"He wun't do it unles he is verry much wuryd, and oenly thretens
it sumtiems, when he gets tierd of studying. I ofen think
I should liek to, especially sinss mi haer wuz cut; so, if U ever
mis us, U mae advertise for too boys, and luuk amung th ships
bound for India."</p>

<p>She laft as she spoek, and Mr. Laurence luukt releevd, evidently
taeking th hoel as a joek.</p>

<p>"U husy, how daer U tauk in that wae? Whaer's yuur respekt
for me, and yuur proper bringing up? Bles th boys and gurls!
Whut torments thae ar; yet we can't do without them," he sed,
pinching her cheeks guud-huemordly. "Go and bring that boy doun
to his diner, tel him it's all riet, and advise him not to put on
trajedy aers with his grandfaather. I wun't baer it."</p>

<p>"He wun't cum, sur; he feels badly because U didn't beleev
him when he sed he couldn't tel. I think th shaeking hurt his feelings
verry much."</p>

<p>Jo tried to luuk pathetik, but must hav faeld, for Mr. Laurence
began to laf, and she knew th dae wuz wun.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for that, and aut to thank him for not shaeking <em>me,</em> 
I supoez. Whut th dickens duz th felo expect?" and th oeld jentlman
luukt a trifle ashamed of his oen testiness.</p>

<p>"If I wer U, I'd riet him an apolojy, sur. He sez he wun't
cum doun till he has wun, and tauks about Washington, and goes
on in an absurd wae. A formal apolojy wil maek him see how foolish
he is, and bring him doun qiet aemiabl. Tri it; he lieks fun,
and this wae is beter than tauking. I'll carry it up, and teech him
his duty."</p>

<p>Mr. Laurence gaev her a sharp luuk, and put on his spektakls, saeing
<span class="pagenum2">268</span>
sloely, "U're a sli puss, but I don't miend being manejd by
U and Beth. Heer, giv me a bit of paeper, and let us hav dun
with this nonsenss."</p>

<p>Th noet wuz riten in th turms which wun jentlman wuud uez
to anuther after ofering sum deep insult. Jo dropt a kis on th
top of Mr. Laurence's bauld hed, and ran up to slip th apolojy under
Laurie's dor, advising him, thru th kee-hoel, to be submissive,
decorus, and a fue uther agreeabl imposibilitys. Fiending th
dor locked again, she left th noet to do its wurk, and wuz going
qieetly away, when th yung jentlman slid doun th banisters,
and waeted for her at th bottom, saeing, with his moest vurchu’us expreshon
of countenanss, "Whut a guud felo U ar, Jo! Did U
get bloen up?" he aded, lafing.</p>

<p>"No; he wuz prity mield, on th hoel."</p>

<p>"Ah! I got it all round; eeven U cast me off oever thaer, and I
felt just redy to go to th deuce," he began apolojetikaly.</p>

<p>"Don't tauk in that wae; turn oever a nue leef and begin again,
Teddy, mi sun."</p>

<p>"I keep turning oever nue leevs, and spoiling them, as I uezd to
spoil mi copy-books; and I maek so meny beginings thaer never
wil be an end," he sed doelfuly.</p>

<p>"Go and eat yuur diner; U'll feel beter after it. Men aulwaes
croek when thae ar hunggry," and Jo whiskt out at th frunt dor
after that.</p>

<p>"That's a 'laebel' on mi 'sekt,'" anserd Laurie, qoeting Amy, as
he went to partaek of humbl-pie dutifully with his grandfaather, hoo
wuz qiet saently in temper and overwhelmingly respektful in maner
all th rest of th dae.</p>

<p>Every wun thaut th mater ended and th litl cloud bloen
oever; but th mischif wuz dun, for, tho others forgot it, Meg
rememberd. She never alooded to a surten purson, but she thaut
of him a guud deel, dreemd dreems mor than ever; and wunss Jo,
rumejing her sister's desk for stamps, found a bit of paeper scribld
oever with th wurds, "Mrs. John Brooke;" whaerat she groend
trajikaly, and cast it into th fier, feeling that Laurie's prank had

<p class="h2a">Plezant Medoes.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Liek</span> sunshine after storm wer th peaceful weeks which foloed.
Th invalids improovd rapidly, and Mr. March began to tauk of returning
eerly in th nue yeer. Beth wuz soon aebl to lie on th study
soefa all dae, amuezing herself with th wel-beluved cats, at furst, and,
in tiem, with dol's soeing, which had faulen sadly behindhand. Her
wunss aktiv lims wer so stif and feebl that Jo tuuk her a daily aering
about th hous in her strong arms. Meg cheerfuly blakend
and burnt her whiet hands cuuking delicat meses for "th deer;"
whiel Amy, a loyal slaev of th ring, selebraeted her return by giving
away as meny of her treasures as she cuud prevael on her sisters to
accept.</p>

<p>As Christmas approached, th uezhual misterys began to haunt th
hous, and Jo freeqently convulst th family by propoezing utterly
imposibl or magnifisently absurd serremoenys, in onor of this unuezhualy
merry Christmas. Laurie wuz equally impraktikabl, and
<span class="pagenum2">270</span>
wuud hav had bonfiers, ski-rokets, and trieumfal arches, if he had
had his oen wae. After meny skirmishes and snubbings, th ambishus
paer wer considerd effectually qencht, and went about
with forlorn faeses, which wer rather belied by exploezhons of lafter
when th too got together.</p>

<p>Several daes of unuezhualy mield wether fitly usherd in a splendid
Christmas Dae. Hannah "felt in her bones" that it wuz going to be
an unuezhualy fien dae, and she proovd herself a troo prophetess,
for everybody and everything seemd bound to produce a grand success.
To begin with, Mr. March roet that he should soon be with
them; then Beth felt uncomonly wel that morning, and, being
drest in her muther's gift,—a soft crimson merino raper,—wuz
borne in trieumf to th windo to behoeld th ofering of Jo and
Laurie. Th Unquenchables had dun thaer best to be wurthy of th
naem, for, liek elvs, thae had wurkt by niet, and conjerd up a
comikal serpriez. Out in th garden stuud a stately sno-maeden,
cround with holy, bearing a basket of froot and flowers in wun hand,
a graet roel of nue muezik in th uther, a perfect raenbo of an Afghan
round her chily shoulders, and a Christmas carol ishooing from her
lips, on a pink paeper streemer:—</p>

<p>How Beth laft when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and doun
to bring in th gifts, and whut ridicuelus speeches Jo maed as she
prezented them!</p>

<p>"I'm so fuul of hapynes, that, if faather wuz oenly heer, I couldn't
hoeld wun drop mor," sed Beth, qiet sieing with contentment as
Jo carried her off to th study to rest after th exsietment, and to
refreshes herself with sum of th delicious graeps th "Jungfrau" had
sent her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">272</span>
"So am I," aded Jo, slaping th poket whaerin repoezd th
long-dezierd Undine and Sintram.</p>

<p>"I'm shuur I am," ecoed Amy, poring oever th engraevd copy of
th Madonna and Chield, which her muther had given her, in a prity
fraem.</p>

<p>"Of corss I am!" cried Meg, smoothing th silvery foelds of her
furst silk dres; for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it.</p>

<p>"How can <em>I</em> be utherwiez?" sed Mrs. March graetfuly, as her
ies went from her huzband's leter to Beth's smieling faess, and her
hand caressed th brooch maed of grae and goelden, chestnut and
dark broun haer, which th gurls had just fasend on her breast.</p>

<p>Now and then, in this wurk-a-dae wurld, things do hapen in th
delietful story-book fashon, and whut a cumfort that is. Haf an
our after every wun had sed thae wer so hapy thae cuud oenly
hoeld wun drop mor, th drop caem. Laurie oepend th parlor dor,
and popt his hed in verry qieetly. He miet just as wel hav
turnd a sumersault and uterd an Indian wor-whoop; for his faess
wuz so fuul of suprest exsietment and his vois so treacherously
joyful, that every wun jumpt up, tho he oenly sed, in a qeer,
breathless vois, "Heer's anuther Christmas prezent for th March
family."</p>

<p>Befor th wurds wer wel out of his mouth, he wuz whiskt away
sumhow, and in his plaess apeerd a taul man, mufld up to th
ies, leening on th arm of anuther taul man, hoo tried to sae sumthing
and couldn't. Of corss thaer wuz a jeneral stampeed; and
for several minits everybody seemd to looz thaer wits, for th straenjest
things wer dun, and no wun sed a wurd. Mr. March becaem
invizibl in th embrace of foer paers of luving arms; Jo disgraest
herself by neerly faenting away, and had to be doktord by Laurie
in th china-clozet; Mr. Brooke kist Meg entierly by mistaek, as
he sumwhot incoeheerently explaend; and Amy, th dignified, tumbld
oever a stool, and, never stoping to get up, hugd and cried
oever her faather's boots in th moest tuching maner. Mrs. March
wuz th furst to recuver herself, and held up her hand with a worning,
"Hush! remember Beth!"</p>

<p>But it wuz too laet; th study dor floo oepen, th litl red raper
<span class="pagenum2">273</span>
apeerd on th threshhoeld,—joy put strength into th feebl
lims,—and Beth ran straet into her faather's arms. Never miend
whut happened just after that; for th fuul harts oeverfloed, woshing
away th bitterness of th past, and leeving oenly th sweetness of th
prezent.</p>

<p>It wuz not at all roemantik, but a harty laf set everybody straet
again, for Hannah wuz discuverd behind th dor, sobing oever th
fat turkey, which she had forgoten to put doun when she rusht
up from th kichen. As th laf subsided, Mrs. March began to
thank Mr. Brooke for his faethful caer of her huzband, at which Mr.
Brooke sudenly rememberd that Mr. March needed rest, and, seezing
Laurie, he precipitately retierd. Then th too invalids wer orderd to
repoez, which thae did, by boeth sitting in wun big chaer, and tauking
hard.</p>

<p>Mr. March toeld how he had longed to serpriez them, and how,
when th fien wether caem, he had been alowd by his doktor to
taek advantej of it; how devoeted Brooke had been, and how he wuz
aultogether a moest estimable and upriets yung man. Whi Mr. March
paused a mienuet just thaer, and, after a glanss at Meg, hoo wuz vieolently
poeking th fier, luukt at his wief with an inqiering lift of th
iebrows, I leev U to imajin; aulso whi Mrs. March jently noded
her hed, and askt, rather abruptly, if he wouldn't hav sumthing
to eat. Jo saw and understuud th luuk; and she staukt grimly
away to get wien and beef-tee, mutering to herself, as she slamd
th dor, "I haet estimable yung men with broun ies!"</p>

<p>Thaer never <em>wuz</em> such a Christmas diner as thae had that dae.
Th fat turkey wuz a siet to behoeld, when Hannah sent him up,
stuft, bround, and decoraeted; so wuz th plum-puuding, which
qiet melted in wun's mouth; liekwiez th jelys, in which Amy reveld
liek a fli in a huny-pot. Everything turnd out wel, which
wuz a mursy, Hannah sed, "For mi miend wuz that flusterd, mum,
that it's a merrycle I didn't roest th puuding, and stuf th turkey
with raezins, let aloen bilin' of it in a cloth."</p>

<p>Mr. Laurence and his grandson diend with them, aulso Mr.
Brooke,—at hoom Jo glowerd darkly, to Laurie's infinit amuezment.
Too eezy-chaers stuud sied by sied at th hed of th taebl,
<span class="pagenum2">274</span>
in which sat Beth and her faather, feesting modestly on chiken and a
litl froot. Thae drank healths, toeld storys, sung songs, "reminist,"
as th oeld foeks sae, and had a thuroely guud tiem. A slae-ried
had been pland, but th gurls wuud not leev thaer faather; so th
guests departed eerly, and, as twilight gatherd, th hapy family sat
together round th fier.</p>

<p>"Just a yeer ago we wer groening oever th dizmal Christmas we
expected to hav. Do U remember?" askt Jo, braeking a short
pause which had foloed a long conversation about meny things.</p>

<p>"Rather a plezant yeer on th hoel!" sed Meg, smieling at th
fier, and congrachulaeting herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with
dignity.</p>

<p>"I think it's been a prity hard wun," obzurvd Amy, woching th
liet shien on her ring, with thautful ies.</p>

<p>"I'm glad it's oever, because we've got U bak," whisperd Beth,
hoo sat on her faather's nee.</p>

<p>"Rather a ruf roed for U to travel, mi litl pilgrims, especially
th later part of it. But U hav got on bravely; and I think
th burdens ar in a faer wae to tumbl off verry soon," sed Mr.
March, luuking with faatherly satisfakshon at th foer yung faeses gatherd
round him.</p>

<p>"How do U noe? Did muther tel U?" askt Jo.</p>

<p>"Not much; straws sho which wae th wiend bloes, and I've
maed several discuverys to-dae."</p>

<p>"O, tel us whut thae ar!" cried Meg, hoo sat besied him.</p>

<p>"Heer is wun;" and taeking up th hand which lae on th arm of
his chaer, he pointed to th rufend forfingger, a burn on th bak,
and too or three litl hard spots on th paam. "I remember a tiem
when this hand wuz whiet and smooth, and yuur furst caer wuz to
keep it so. It wuz verry prity then, but to me it is much prityer
now,—for in thees seeming blemishes I red a litl history. A
burnt-ofering has been maed of vanity; this hardend paam has
urnd sumthing beter than blisters; and I'm shuur th soeing dun
by thees prikt finggers wil last a long tiem, so much guud-wil went
into th stitches. Meg, mi deer, I value th wuumanly skil which
keeps hoem hapy mor than whiet hands or fashonabl accomplishments.
<span class="pagenum2">275</span>
I'm proud to shaek this guud, industrius litl hand, and
hoep I shal not soon be askt to giv it away."</p>

<p>If Meg had wontedw a reword for ours of paeshent laebor, she reseevd
it in th harty presher of her faather's hand and th aprooving
smiel he gaev her.</p>

<p>"Whut about Jo? Pleez sae sumthing niess; for she has tried so
hard, and been so verry, verry guud to me," sed Beth, in her faather's
eer.</p>

<p>He laft, and luukt acros at th taul gurl hoo sat opozit,
with an unuezhualy mield expreshon in her broun faess.</p>

<p>"In spiet of th curly crop, I don't see th 'sun Jo' hoom I left
a yeer ago," sed Mr. March. "I see a yung laedy hoo pins her collar
straet, laeses her boots neetly, and neether whisls, tauks slang,
nor lies on th rug as she uezd to do. Her faess is rather thin and
pale, just now, with woching and anxiety; but I liek to luuk at it,
for it has groen jentler, and her vois is loeer; she doesn't bounss,
but moovs qieetly, and taeks caer of a surten litl purson in a mutherly
wae which deliets me. I rather mis mi wield gurl; but if I get
a strong, helpful, tender-hearted wuuman in her plaess, I shal feel qiet
satisfied. I don't noe whether th sheering soeberd our blak sheep,
but I do noe that in all Washington I couldn't fiend anything buetiful
enough to be bought with th fiev-and-twenty dolars which mi
guud gurl sent me."</p>

<p>Jo's keen ies wer rather dim for a mienuet, and her thin faess groo
roezy in th fierliet, as she reseevd her faather's praez, feeling that she
did dezurv a porshon of it.</p>

<p>"Now Beth," sed Amy, longing for her turn, but redy to waet.</p>

<p>"Thaer's so litl of her, I'm afraed to sae much, for feer she wil
slip away aultogether, tho she is not so shi as she uezd to be,"
began thaer faather cheerfuly; but recolekting how neerly he <em>had</em> lost
her, he held her cloez, saeing tenderly, with her cheek against his
oen, "I've got U saef, mi Beth, and I'll keep U so, pleez God."</p>

<p>After a mienuet's silence, he luukt doun at Amy, hoo sat on th
criket at his feet, and sed, with a caress of th shiening haer,—</p>

<p>"I obzurvd that Amy tuuk drumstiks at diner, ran errands for
her muther all th afternoon, gaev Meg her plaess to-niet, and has
<span class="pagenum2">276</span>
waeted on every wun with paeshenss and guud-huemor. I aulso obzurv
that she duz not fret much nor luuk in th glas, and has not eeven
menshond a verry prity ring which she waers; so I conclood that
she has lurnd to think of uther peepl mor and of herself les, and
has desieded to tri and mould her carrakter as carefully as she moulds
her litl clay figuers. I am glad of this; for tho I should be verry
proud of a graesful stachoo maed by her, I shal be infinitly prouder
of a luvabl dauter, with a talent for maeking lief buetiful to herself
and others."</p>

<p>"Whut ar U thinking of, Beth?" askt Jo, when Amy had
thankt her faather and toeld about her ring.</p>

<p>"I red in 'Pilgrim's Progres' to-dae, how, after meny trubls,
Christian and Hoepful caem to a plezant green medo, whaer lilys
bloomd all th yeer round, and thaer thae rested hapily, as we do
now, befor thae went on to thaer jurny's end," anserd Beth;
ading, as she slipt out of her faather's arms, and went sloely to th
instrument, "It's singing tiem now, and I wont to be in mi oeld plaess.
I'll tri to sing th song of th sheperd-boy which th Pilgrims hurd.
I maed th muezik for faather, because he lieks th vurses."</p>

<p>So, sitting at th deer litl piano, Beth softly tucht th kees,
and, in th sweet vois thae had never thaut to heer again, sung
to her oen accompaniment th qaent him, which wuz a singularly
fitting song for her:—</p>

about Mr. March th next dae,
neglekting everything to luuk at,
waet upon, and lisen to th nue invalid,
hoo wuz in a faer wae to be
kild by kiendnes. As he sat
propped up in a big chaer by Beth's
soefa, with th uther three cloez by,
and Hannah poping in her hed
now and then, "to peek at th deer
man," nuthing seemd needed to
complete thaer hapynes. But
sumthing <em>wuz</em> needed, and th
elder wuns felt it, tho nun confest
th fakt. Mr. and Mrs. March
luukt at wun anuther with an
anxious expreshon, as thaer ies foloed
Meg. Jo had suden fits of
sobrieety, and wuz seen to shaek her
fist at Mr. Brooke's umbrela, which
had been left in th haul; Meg wuz
absent-miended, shi, and silent,
started when th bel rang, and
culord when John's naem wuz menshond;
Amy sed "Every wun
seemd waeting for sumthing, and
couldn't setl doun, which wuz qeer, sinss faather wuz saef at
hoem," and Beth inosently wunderd whi thaer naebors didn't
run oever as uezhual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">278</span>
Laurie went by in th afternoon, and, seeing Meg at th windo,
seemd sudenly possessed with a melodramatik fit, for he fel doun
upon wun nee in th sno, beet his breast, tore his haer, and clasped
his hands imploringly, as if beging sum boon; and when Meg toeld
him to behaev himself and go away, he wrung imajinarry teers out of
his hankerchif, and stagerd round th corner as if in uter despaer.</p>

<p>"Whut duz th gooss meen?" sed Meg, lafing, and trieing to
luuk unconshus.</p>

<p>"He's shoeing U how yuur John wil go on by and by. Tuching,
isn't it?" anserd Jo scornfuly.</p>

<p>"Don't sae <i>mi John</i>, it isn't proper or troo;" but Meg's vois
linggerd oever th wurds as if thae sounded plezant to her. "Pleez
don't plaeg me, Jo; I've toeld U I don't caer <em>much</em> about him, and
thaer isn't to be anything sed, but we ar all to be frendly, and go
on as befor."</p>

<p>"We can't, for sumthing <em>has</em> been sed, and Laurie's mischif has
spoilt U for me. I see it, and so duz muther; U ar not liek
yuur oeld self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I don't meen
to plaeg U, and wil baer it liek a man, but I do wish it wuz all
setld. I haet to waet; so if U meen ever to do it, maek haest and
hav it oever qikly," sed Jo pettishly.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> can't sae or do anything till he speeks, and he wun't, because
faather sed I wuz too yung," began Meg, bending oever her wurk, with
a qeer litl smiel, which sugjested that she did not qiet agree with
her faather on that pointer.</p>

<p>"If he did speek, U wouldn't noe whut to sae, but wuud cri
or blush, or let him hav his oen wae, insted of giving a guud, desieded,
No."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sily and week as U think. I noe just whut I should

no noeing whut mae hapen, and I wisht to be prepaerd."</p>

<p>Jo couldn't help smieling at th important aer which Meg had unconshusly
asuemd, and which wuz as becuming as th prity culor vaerying
in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Wuud U miend teling me whut U'd sae?" askt Jo mor
respektfuly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">279</span>
"Not at all; U ar sixteen now, qiet oeld enough to be mi confidant,
and mi expeeri’enss wil be uesful to U by and by, perhaps,

<p>"Don't meen to hav any; it's fun to woch uther peepl philander,
but I should feel liek a fool dooing it mieself," sed Jo, luuking alarmd
at th thaut.</p>

<p>"I think not, if U liked any wun verry much, and he liked U."
Meg spoek as if to herself, and glanst out at th laen, whaer she had
ofen seen luvers wauking together in th sumer twilight.</p>

<p>"I thaut U wer going to tel yuur speech to that man," sed
Jo, roodly shortening her sister's litl reverie.</p>

<p>"O, I should meerly sae, qiet calmly and decidedly, 'Thank U,
Mr. Brooke, U ar verry kiend, but I agree with faather that I am too
yung to enter into any engaejment at prezent; so pleez sae no

<p>"Hum! that's stif and cool enough. I don't beleev U'll ever

th rejekted luvers in books, U'll giv in, rather than hurt his

<p><ins title="Add exclamation point after won&#39;t."> 
"No, I wun't!</ins> I shal tel him I've maed up mi miend, and shal

<p>Meg roez as she spoek, and wuz just going to rehurss th dignified
exit, when a step in th haul maed her fli into her seet, and begin to
soe as if her lief depended on finishing that particular seem in a given
tiem. Jo smutherd a laf at th suden chaenj, and, when sum
wun gaev a modest tap, oepend th dor with a grim aspekt, which
wuz anything but hospitabl.</p>

<p>"Guud afternoon. I caem to get mi umbrela,—that is, to see how
yuur faather fiends himself to-dae," sed Mr. Brooke, geting a trifle confuezd
as his ie went from wun tel-tael faess to th uther.</p>

<p>"It's verry wel, he's in th rak, I'll get him, and tel it U ar
heer," and having jumbld her faather and th umbrela wel together
in her replie, Jo slipt out of th room to giv Meg a chanss to
maek her speech and aer her dignity. But th instant she vanisht,
Meg began to sidle tords' th dor, murmering,—</p>

<p>"Muther wil liek to see U. Prae sit doun, I'll call her."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">280</span>
"Don't go; ar U afraed of me, Margaret?" and Mr. Brooke
luukt so hurt that Meg thaut she must hav dun sumthing verry
rood. She blushed up to th litl curls on her forhed, for he had
never called her Margaret befor, and she wuz serpriezd to fiend how
nacheral and sweet it seemd to heer him sae it. Anxious to apeer
frendly and at her eez, she put out her hand with a confieding jescher,
and sed graetfuly,—</p>

<p>"How can I be afraed when U hav been so kiend to faather? I
oenly wish I cuud thank U for it."</p>

</div>

<p>"Shal I tel U how?" askt Mr. Brooke, hoelding th small hand
fast in boeth his oen, and luuking doun at Meg with so much luv in
<span class="pagenum2">281</span>
th broun ies, that her hart began to flutter, and she boeth longed to
run away and to stop and lisen.</p>

<p>"O no, pleez don't—I'd rather not," she sed, trieing to withdraw
her hand, and luuking frietend in spiet of her denieal.</p>

<p>"I wun't trubl U, I oenly wont to noe if U caer for me a
litl, Meg. I luv U so much, deer," aded Mr. Brooke tenderly.</p>

<p>This wuz th moement for th calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't
maek it; she forgot every wurd of it, hung her hed, and anserd, "I
don't noe," so softly, that John had to stoop doun to cach th foolish
litl replie.</p>

<p>He seemd to think it wuz wurth th trubl, for he smield to himself
as if qiet satisfied, prest th plump hand graetfuly, and sed, in his
moest persuasive toen, "Wil U tri and fiend out? I wont to noe
<em>so</em> much; for I can't go to wurk with any hart until I lurn whether
I am to hav mi reword in th end or not."</p>

<p>"I'm too yung," faulterd Meg, wundering whi she wuz so fluttered,
yet rather enjoying it.</p>

<p>"I'll waet; and in th meentiem, U cuud be lurning to liek me.
Wuud it be a verry hard leson, deer?"</p>

<p>"Not if I choez to lurn it, but—"</p>

<p>"Pleez chooz to lurn, Meg. I luv to teech, and this is eezyer
than German," broek in John, geting possession of th uther hand, so
that she had no wae of hieding her faess, as he bent to luuk into it.</p>

<p>His toen wuz properly beseeching; but, stealing a shi luuk at him,
Meg saw that his ies wer merry as wel as tender, and that he wor
th satisfied smiel of wun hoo had no dout of his success. This
netld her; Annie Moffat's foolish lesons in coeketry caem into her
miend, and th luv of power, which sleeps in th bosoms of th best
of litl wimen, woek up all of a suden and tuuk possession of her.
She felt exsieted and straenj, and, not noeing whut else to do, foloed
a capricious impulss, and, withdrawing her hands, sed petulantly,
"I <em>don't</em> chooz. Pleez go away and let me be!"</p>

<p>Puur Mr. Brooke luukt as if his luvly casl in th aer wuz tumbling
about his eers, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood befor,
and it rather bewildered him.</p>

<p>"Do U reealy meen that?" he askt anxiously, foloeing her as
she waukt away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">282</span>
"Yes, I do; I don't wont to be wuryd about such things. Faather
sez I needn't; it's too soon and I'd rather not."</p>

<p>"Mayn't I hoep U'll chaenj yuur miend by and by? I'll waet,
and sae nuthing till U hav had mor tiem. Don't plae with me,
Meg. I didn't think that of U."</p>

<p>"Don't think of me at all. I'd rather U wouldn't," sed Meg,
taeking a nauty satisfakshon in trieing her luver's paeshenss and her
oen power.</p>

<p>He wuz graev and pale now, and luukt decidedly mor liek th
novel heroes hoom she admierd; but he neether slapt his forhed
nor trampt about th
room, as thae did; he
just stuud luuking at
her so wistfuly, so tenderly,
that she found
her hart relenting in
spiet of her. Whut
wuud hav happened
next I cannot sae, if
Ant March had not
cum hobbling in at
this interesting mienuet.</p>

<p>Th oeld laedy couldn't
rezist her longing to
see her nefue; for
she had met Laurie as
she tuuk her aering,
and, heering of Mr.
March's arrival, droev
straet out to see him.
Th family wer all
busy in th bak part
of th hous, and she
had maed her wae qieetly in, hoeping to serpriez them. She did
serpriez too of them so much that Meg started as if she had seen a
goest, and Mr. Brooke vanisht into th study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">283</span></p>

<p>
"Bles me, whut's all this?" cried th oeld laedy, with a rap of her
caen, as she glanst from th pale yung jentlman to th scarlet
yung laedy.</p>

<p>"It's faather's frend. I'm <em>so</em> serpriezd to see U!" stamerd
Meg, feeling that she wuz in for a lecture now.</p>

<p>"That's evident," returnd Ant March, sitting doun. "But whut
is faather's frend saeing to maek U luuk liek a peony? Thaer's
mischif going on, and I insist upon noeing whut it is," with
anuther rap.</p>

<p>"We wer meerly tauking. Mr. Brooke caem for his umbrela,"
began Meg, wishing that Mr. Brooke and th umbrela wer saefly out
of th hous.</p>

<p>"Brooke? That boy's tuetor? Ah! I understand now. I noe
all about it. Jo blunderd into a rong mesej in wun of yuur faather's
leters, and I maed her tel me. U haeven't gon and accepted
him, chield?" cried Ant March, luuking scandalized.</p>

<p>"Hush! he'll heer. Sha'n't I call muther?" sed Meg, much
trubld.</p>

<p>"Not yet. I've sumthing to sae to U, and I must free mi miend
at wunss. Tel me, do U meen to marry this Cuuk? If U do, not
wun peny of mi muny ever goes to U. Remember that, and be
a sensibl gurl," sed th oeld laedy impresivly.</p>

<p>Now Ant March possessed in perfection th art of rouzing th
spirit of opozishon in th jentlest peepl, and enjoyd dooing it. Th
best of us hav a spiess of pervursity in us, especially when we ar
yung and in luv. If Ant March had begd Meg to accept John
Brooke, she wuud probably hav declaerd she couldn't think of it;
but as she wuz peremptorily orderd <em>not</em> to liek him, she imeediatly
maed up her miend that she wuud. Inclinaeshon as wel as pervursity
maed th desizhon eezy, and, being aulredy much exsieted, Meg
opoezd th oeld laedy with uenuezhual spirit.</p>

<p>"I shal marry hoom I pleez, Ant March, and U can leev yuur
muny to any wun U liek," she sed, noding her hed with a rezoloot
aer.</p>

<p>"Highty tighty! Is that th wae U taek mi advice, mis? U'll
be sorry for it, by and by, when U've tried luv in a cotej, and
found it a faeluer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">284</span>
"It can't be a wurss wun than sum peepl fiend in big houses,"
retorted Meg.</p>

<p>Ant March put on her glases and tuuk a luuk at th gurl, for she
did not noe her in this nue mood. Meg hardly knew herself, she
felt so braev and independent,—so glad to defend John, and assert
her riet to luv him, if she liked. Ant March saw that she had
begun rong, and, after a litl pause, maed a fresh start, saeing, as
mieldly as she cuud, "Now, Meg, mi deer, be reezonabl, and taek
mi advice. I meen it kiendly, and don't wont U to spoil yuur hoel
lief by maeking a mistaek at th begining. U aut to marry wel,
and help yuur family; it's yuur duty to maek a rich mach, and it
aut to be imprest upon U."</p>

<p>"Faather and muther don't think so; thae liek John, tho he <em>is</em>
puur."</p>

<p>"Yuur paerents, mi deer, hav no mor wurldly wizdom than too
baebys."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it," cried Meg stoutly.</p>

<p>Ant March tuuk no noetis, but went on with her lecture. "This
Ruuk is puur, and hasn't got any rich relaeshons, has he?"</p>

<p>"No; but he has meny worm frends."</p>

<p>"U can't liv on frends; tri it, and see how cool thae'll gro.
He hasn't any business, has he?"</p>

<p>"Not yet; Mr. Laurence is going to help him."</p>

<p>"That wun't last long. James Laurence is a crochety oeld felo,
and not to be depended on. So U intend to marry a man without
muny, pozishon, or business, and go on wurking harder than U do
now, when U miet be comfortable all yuur daes by miending me
and dooing beter? I thaut U had mor senss, Meg."</p>

<p>"I couldn't do beter if I waeted haf mi lief! John is guud and
wiez; he's got heeps of talent; he's wiling to wurk, and shuur to get
on, he's so enerjetik and braev. Every wun lieks and respekts him,
and I'm proud to think he caers for me, tho I'm so puur and
yung and sily," sed Meg, luuking prityer than ever in her urnestly.</p>

<p>"He noes <em>U</em> hav got rich relaeshons, chield; that's th seecret of
his lieking, I suspekt."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">285</span>
"Ant March, how daer U sae such a thing? John is abuv such
meennes, and I wun't lisen to U a mienuet if U tauk so," cried
Meg indignantly, forgeting everything but th injustis of th oeld
laedy's suspishons. "Mi John wouldn't marry for muny, anymore
than I wuud. We ar wiling to wurk, and we meen to waet. I'm
not afraed of being puur, for I've been hapy so far, and I noe I
shal be with him, because he luvs me, and I—"</p>

<p>Meg stopt thaer, remembering all of a suden that she hadn't
maed up her miend; that she had toeld "her John" to go away, and
that he miet be oeverheering her inconsistent remarks.</p>

<p>Ant March wuz verry anggry, for she had set her hart on having her
prity neess maek a fien mach, and sumthing in th gurl's hapy
yung faess maed th loenly oeld wuuman feel boeth sad and sour.</p>

<p>"Wel, I wosh mi hands of th hoel affair! U ar a wilful chield,
and U've lost mor than U noe by this peess of foly. No, I
wun't stop; I'm disapointed in U, and haeven't spirits to see yuur
faather now. Don't expect anything from me when U ar marryd;
yuur Mr. Book's frends must taek caer of U. I'm dun with U
forever."</p>

<p>And, slaming th dor in Meg's faess, Ant March droev off in
hie dujon. She seemd to taek all th gurl's curej with her; for,
when left aloen, Meg stuud a moement, undecided whether to laf or
cri. Befor she cuud maek up her miend, she wuz taeken possession
of by Mr. Brooke, hoo sed, all in wun breth, "I couldn't help heering,
Meg. Thank U for defending me, and Ant March for prooving
that U <em>do</em> caer for me a litl bit."</p>

<p>"I didn't noe how much, till she abuezd U," began Meg.</p>

<p>"And I needn't go away, but mae stae and be hapy, mae I,
deer?"</p>

<p>Heer wuz anuther fien chanss to maek th crushing speech and th
stately exit, but Meg never thaut of dooing eether, and disgraest
herself forever in Jo's ies by meekly whispering, "Yes, John," and
hieding her faess on Mr. Brooke's waestcoet.</p>

<p>Fifteen minits after Ant March's deparcher, Jo caem softly doun
staers, paused an instant at th parlor dor, and, heering no sound
within, noded and smield, with a satisfied expreshon, saeing to herself,
<span class="pagenum2">286</span>
"She has sent him away as we pland, and that affair is setld.
I'll go and heer th fun, and hav a guud laf oever it."</p>

<p>But puur Jo never got her laf, for she wuz transfixed upon th
threshhoeld by a spektakl which held her thaer, staering with her mouth
neerly as wied oepen as her ies. Going in to exult oever a faulen enemy,
and to praez a strong-miended sister for th banishment of an objekshonabl
luver, it surtenly <em>wuz</em> a shok to behoeld th aforesaid enemy
sereenly sitting on th soefa, with th strong-miended sister enthroned
upon his nee, and waering an expreshon of th moest abjekt submission.
Jo gaev a sort of gasp, as if a coeld shower-bath had sudenly
faulen upon her,—for such an unexpekted turning of th taebls akchualy
tuuk her breth away. At th od sound, th luvers turnd and
saw her. Meg jumpt up, luuking boeth proud and shi; but "that
man," as Jo called him, akchualy laft, and sed coolly, as he kist
th astonisht nue-comer, "Sister Jo, congrachulaet us!"</p>

<p>That wuz ading insult to injery,—it wuz aultogether too 
much,—and, maeking sum wield demonstraeshon with her hands, Jo 
vanisht without a wurd. Rushing upstaers, she startld th invalids by 
exclaeming trajikaly, as she burst into th room, "O, <em>do</em> 
sumbody go doun qik; <ins title="Replace actingly with acting."> 
John Brooke is akting dredfuly,</ins> and Meg lieks it!"</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. March left th room with speed; and, casting herself
upon th bed, Jo cried and scoelded tempestuously as she toeld th auful
nues to Beth and Amy. Th litl gurls, however, considerd it a moest
agreeabl and interesting event, and Jo got litl cumfort from them;
so she went up to her refuej in th garret, and confieded her trubls
to th rats.</p>

<p>Noebody ever knew whut went on in th parlor that afternoon; but
a graet deel of tauking wuz dun, and qieet Mr. Brooke astonisht his
frends by th eloquence and spirit with which he pleeded his suit, toeld
his plans, and persuaded them to araenj everything just as he wontedw
it.</p>

<p>Th tee-bel rang befor he had finisht descriebing th paradise which
he ment to urn for Meg, and he proudly tuuk her in to super, boeth
luuking so hapy that Jo hadn't th hart to be jelus or dizmal.
Amy wuz verry much imprest by John's devoeshon and Meg's dignity.
Beth beemd at them from a distanss, whiel Mr. and Mrs. March survaed
<span class="pagenum2">287</span>
th yung cupl with such tender satisfakshon that it wuz perfectly
evident Ant March wuz riet in calling them as "unwurldly
as a paer of baebys." No wun aet much, but every wun luukt verry
hapy, and th oeld room seemd to brieten up amaezingly when th
furst roemanss of th family began thaer.</p>

<p>"U can't sae nuthing plezant ever happens now, can U, Meg?"
sed Amy, trieing to desied how she wuud groop th luvers in th
skech she wuz planing to taek.</p>

<p>"No, I'm shuur I can't. How much has happened sinss I sed that!
It seems a yeer ago," anserd Meg, hoo wuz in a blissful dreem,
lifted far abuv such common things as bred and buter.</p>

<p>"Th joys cum cloez upon th sorroes this tiem, and I rather
think th chaenjes hav begun," sed Mrs. March. "In moest familys
thaer cums, now and then, a yeer fuul of events; this has been such
an wun, but it ends wel, after all."</p>

<p>"Hoep th next wil end beter," muterd Jo, hoo found it verry
hard to see Meg absorbd in a straenjer befor her faess; for Jo luvd
a fue pursons verry deerly, and dreded to hav thaer affection lost or
lesend in any wae.</p>

<p>"I hoep th thurd yeer from this <em>wil</em> end beter; I meen it shal,
if I liv to wurk out mi plans," sed Mr. Brooke, smieling at Meg, as
if everything had becum posibl to him now.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it seem verry long to waet?" askt Amy, hoo wuz in a
hurry for th weding.</p>

<p>"I've got so much to lurn befor I shal be redy, it seems a short
tiem to me," anserd Meg, with a sweet gravity in her faess, never
seen thaer befor.</p>

<p>"U hav oenly to waet; <em>I</em> am to do th wurk," sed John, begining
his laebors by piking up Meg's napkin, with an expreshon which
cauzd Jo to shaek her hed, and then sae to herself, with an aer of
releef, as th frunt dor bangd, "Heer cums Laurie. Now we shal
hav a litl sensibl conversation."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">

<p>But Jo wuz mistaeken; for Laurie caem pransing in, oeverfloeing with
spirits, bearing a graet briedal-luuking bouquet for "Mrs. John Brooke,"
and evidently laeboring under th deloozhon that th hoel affair had
been brought about by his exselent manejment.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum2">288</span>
"I knew Brooke wuud hav it all his oen wae, he aulwaes duz; for
when he maeks up his miend to accomplish anything, it's dun, tho
th ski fauls," sed Laurie, when he had prezented his ofering and his
congrachulaeshons.</p>

<p>"Much obliejd for that recomendaeshon. I taek it as a guud oemen
for th fuecher, and inviet U to mi weding on th spot," anserd
Mr. Brooke, hoo felt at
<ins title="Place comma after mankind."> 
peess with all man-kiend,</ins>
eeven his mischivus
pupil.</p>

<p>"I'll cum if I'm at
th ends of th urth;
for th siet of Jo's faess

wuud be wurth a long
jurny. U don't luuk
festiv, maa'am; whut's
th mater?" askt Laurie,
foloeing her into a
corner of th parlor,
whither all had ajurnd
to greet Mr.
Laurence.</p>

<p>"I don't aproov of
th mach, but I've
maed up mi miend to
baer it, and shal not sae
a wurd against it," sed
Jo solemly. "U can't
noe how hard it is for me to giv up Meg," she continued, with a
litl qiver in her vois.</p>

<p>"U don't giv her up. U oenly go havs," sed Laurie consolingly.</p>

<p>"It never can be th saem again. I've lost mi deerest frend,"
sighed Jo.</p>

<p>"U've got me, anyhow. I'm not guud for much, I noe; but
<span class="pagenum2">289</span>
I'll stand by U, Jo, all th daes of mi lief; upon mi wurd I wil!"
and Laurie ment whut he sed.</p>

<p>"I noe U wil, and I'm ever so much obliejd; U ar aulwaes
a graet cumfort to me, Teddy," returnd Jo, graetfuly shaeking hands.</p>

<p>"Wel, now, don't be dizmal, thaer's a guud felo. It's all riet,
U see. Meg is hapy; Brooke wil fli round and get setld imeediatly;
grandpa wil atend to him, and it wil be verry joly to see
Meg in her oen litl hous. We'll hav capital times after she is
gon, for I shal be thru colej befor long, and then we'll go
abraud, or sum niess trip or uther. Wouldn't that consoel U?"</p>

<p>"I rather think it wuud; but thaer's no noeing whut mae hapen
in three yeers," sed Jo thautfuly.</p>

<p>"That's troo. Don't U wish U cuud taek a luuk forward, and
see whaer we shal all be then? I do," returnd Laurie.</p>

<p>"I think not, for I miet see sumthing sad; and every wun luuks
so hapy now, I don't beleev thae cuud be much improovd," and Jo's
ies went sloely round th room, brietening as thae luukt, for th
prospekt wuz a plezant wun.</p>

<p>Faather and muther sat together, qieetly re-living th furst chapter of
th roemanss which for them began sum twenty yeers ago. Amy wuz
drawing th luvers, hoo sat apart in a buetiful wurld of thaer oen,
th liet of which tucht thaer faeses with a graess th litl artist cuud
not copy. Beth lae on her soefa, tauking cheerily with her oeld frend,
hoo held her litl hand as if he felt that it possessed th power to
leed him along th peaceful wae she waukt. Jo lounged in her faevorit
loe seet, with th graev, qieet luuk which best becaem her; and
Laurie, leening on th bak of her chaer, his chin on a level with her
curly hed, smield with his frendlyest aspekt, and noded at her in th
long glas which reflekted them boeth.</p>

<p class="h2a">Gosip.</p>

<p><span class="smc">In</span>
order that we mae start afresh, and go to Meg's weding with
free miends, it wil be wel to begin with a litl gosip about th
Marches. And heer let me premis, that if any of th elders think
thaer is too much "lovering" in th story, as I feer thae mae (I'm
not afraed th yung foeks wil maek that objekshon), I can oenly sae
with Mrs. March, "Whut <em>can</em> U expect when I hav foer gae gurls
in th hous, and a dashing yung naebor oever th wae?"</p>

<p>Th three yeers that hav past hav brought but fue chaenjes to
th qieet family. Th wor is oever, and Mr. March saefly at hoem,
busy with his books and th small parish which found in him a minister
by naechuur as by graess,—a qieet, stoodius man, rich in th wizdom
<span class="pagenum2">294</span>
that is beter than lurning, th charrity which calls all man-kiend
"bruther," th piety that blossoms into carrakter, maeking it august
and luvly.</p>

<p>Thees atribuets, in spiet of poverty and th strikt integrity which
shut him out from th mor wurldly successes, atrakted to him meny
admerabl pursons, as nacheraly as sweet urbs draw bees, and as nacheraly
he gaev them th huny into which fifty yeers of hard expeeri’enss
had distild no biter drop. Urnest yung men found th grae-heded
scolar as yung at hart as thae; thautful or trubld
wimen instinktivly brought thaer doubts and sorroes to him, shuur of
fiending th jentlest simpathy, th wiezest counsel; sinners toeld thaer
sins to th puer-hearted oeld man, and wer boeth rebuekt and saevd;
gifted men found a companyon in him; ambishus men caut glimpses
of noebler ambishons than thaer oen; and eeven worldlings confest
that his beleefs wer buetiful and troo, aultho "thae wouldn't pae."</p>

<p>To outsieders, th fiev enerjetik wimen seemd to rool th hous,
and so thae did in meny things; but th qieet scolar, sitting amung
his books, wuz still th hed of th family, th hous-hoeld conshenss,
ancor, and comforter; for to him th busy, anxious wimen aulwaes
turnd in troublous times, fiending him, in th truest senss of thoes
saecred wurds, huzband and faather.</p>

<p>Th gurls gaev thaer harts into thaer muther's keeping, thaer soels
into thaer faather's; and to boeth paerents, hoo livd and laebord so
faethfuly for them, thae gaev a luv that groo with thaer groeth, and
bound them tenderly together by th sweetest tie which bleses lief
and outlivd deth.</p>

<p>Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, tho rather graeer, than when
we saw her last, and just now so absorbd in Meg's affairs that th
hospitals and hoems, still fuul of woonded "boys" and soeljers' widoes,
decidedly mis th mutherly mishonaery's vizits.</p>

<p>John Brooke did his duty manfuly for a yeer, got woonded, wuz
sent hoem, and not alowd to return. He reseevd no stars or bars,
but he dezurvd them, for he cheerfuly riskt all he had; and lief
and luv ar verry precious when boeth ar in fuul bloom. Perfectly
reziend to his discharj, he devoeted himself to geting wel, prepaering
for business, and urning a hoem for Meg. With th guud senss
<span class="pagenum2">295</span> and sturdy independenss that 
carrakteriezd him, he refuezd Mr. Laurence's mor jenerus ofers, 
and accepted th plaess of book-keeper feeling beter satisfied to 
begin with <ins title="Place comma after salary.">  
an onestly-urnd salary, than by runing</ins>
any risks with borrowed muny.</p>

<p>Meg had spent th tiem in wurking as wel as waeting, groeing wuumanly
in carrakter, wiez in housewifely arts, and prityer than ever; for
luv is a graet beautifier. She had her gurlish ambishons and hoeps, and
felt sum disapointment at th humbl wae in which th nue lief
must begin. Ned Moffat had just marryd Sallie Gardiner, and Meg
couldn't help contrasting thaer fien hous and carrej, meny gifts,
and splendid outfit, with her oen, and seecretly wishing she cuud hav
th saem. But sumhow envy and discontent soon vanisht when
she thaut of all th paeshent luv and laebor John had put into th
litl hoem awaiting her; and when thae sat together in th twilight,
tauking oever thaer small plans, th fuecher aulwaes groo so buetiful and
briet that she forgot Sallie's splendor, and felt herself th richest,
hapyest gurl in Christendom.</p>

<p>Jo never went bak to Ant March, for th oeld laedy tuuk such a
fansy to Amy that she bribed her with th ofer of drawing lesons
from wun of th best teechers going; and for th saek of this advantej,
Amy wuud hav survd a far harder mistres. So she gaev her
mornings to duty, her afternoons to plezher, and prosperd fienly.
Jo, meentiem, devoeted herself to literachuur and Beth, hoo remaend
delicat long after th feever wuz a thing of th past. Not an invalid
exaktly, but never again th roezy, helthy creecher she had been; yet
aulwaes hoepful, hapy, and sereen, busy with th qieet duties she luvd,
every wun's frend, and an aenjel in th hous, long befor thoes hoo
luvd her moest had lurnd to noe it.</p>

<p>As long as "Th Spred Eegl" paed her a dolar a column for her
"rubish," as she called it, Jo felt herself a wuuman of means, and
spun her litl roemanses dilijently. But graet plans fermented in
her busy braen and ambishus miend, and th oeld tin kichen in th
garret held a sloely increesing piel of bloted manuescript, which wuz
wun dae to plaess th naem of March upon th roel of faem.</p>

<p>Laurie, having dutifully gon to colej to pleez his grandfaather,
wuz now geting thru it in th eezyest posibl maner to pleez
<span class="pagenum2">296</span>
himself. A uenivursal faevorit, thanks to muny, maners, much talent,
and th kiendest hart that ever got its oener into scraeps by trieing
to get uther peepl out of them, he stuud in graet daenjer of being
spoilt, and probably wuud hav been, liek meny anuther promising
boy, if he had not possessed a talisman against eevil in th memory of
th kiend oeld man hoo wuz bound up in his success, th mutherly
frend hoo wocht oever him as if he wer her sun, and last, but not
leest by any means, th nolej that foer inosent gurls luvd, admierd,
and beleevd in him with all thaer harts.</p>

<p>Being oenly "a glorius hueman boy," of corss he frolikt and
flurted, groo dandified, aqotik, sentimental, or gymnastic, as colej
fashons ordaend; haezd and wuz haezd, taukt slang, and mor than
wunss caem perilously neer suspenshon and expulshon. But as hie
spirits and th luv of fun wer th cauzes of thees pranks, he aulwaes
manejd to saev himself by frank confeshon, onorabl atonement,
or th irezistibl power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection.
In fakt, he rather prided himself on his narro escaeps, and liked to
thril th gurls with grafik accounts of his trieumfs oever rathful tuetors,
dignified professors, and vanqisht enemys. Th "men of mi
clas" wer heroes in th ies of th gurls, hoo never wearied of th
exploits of "our feloes," and wer freeqently alowd to bask in th
smiels of thees graet creechers, when Laurie brought them hoem with
him.</p>

<p>Amy especially enjoyd this hie onor, and becaem qiet a belle
amung them; for her ladyship eerly felt and lurnd to uez th gift of
fasinaeshon with which she wuz endowd. Meg wuz too much absorbd
in her private and particular John to caer for any uther lords
of creaeshon, and Beth too shi to do mor than peep at them, and
wunder how Amy dared to order them about so; but Jo felt qiet in
her element, and found it verry dificult to refraen from imitaeting th
jentlmanly atitoods, phrases, and feets, which seemd mor nacheral
to her than th decorums prescriebd for yung laedys. Thae all liked
Jo imensly, but never fel in luv with her, tho verry fue escaept
without paying th tribute of a sentimental sie or too at Amy's shrien.
And speeking of sentiment brings us verry nacheraly to th "Duv-cote."</p>

<p>That wuz th naem of th litl broun hous which Mr. Brooke had
<span class="pagenum2">297</span>
prepaerd for Meg's furst hoem. Laurie had crisend it, saeing it
wuz hiely aproepriat to th jentl luvers, hoo "went on together liek
a paer of turtle-duvs, with furst a bil and then a coo." It wuz a tieny
hous, with a litl garden behind, and a laun about as big as a poket-hankerchif
in frunt. Heer Meg ment to hav a founten, shrubery,
and a profusion of luvly flowers; tho just at prezent, th
founten wuz reprezented by a wether-beeten urn, verry liek a dilapidaeted
slop-boel; th shrubery consisted of several yung larches,
undecided whether to liv or die; and th profusion of flowers wuz
meerly hinted by rejiments of stiks, to sho whaer seeds wer
planted. But insied, it wuz aultogether charming, and th hapy bried
saw no fault from garret to selar. To be shuur, th haul wuz so narro,
it wuz forchunat that thae had no piano, for wun never cuud hav
been got in hoel; th diening-room wuz so small that six peepl
wer a tight fit; and th kichen staers seemd bilt for th expres
purpos of precipitating boeth survants and china pelmel into th
coel-bin. But wunss get uezd to thees sliet blemishes, and nuthing
cuud be mor complete, for guud senss and guud taest had prezieded
oever th furnishing, and th rezult wuz hiely satisfaktory. Thaer
wer no marbl-topt taebls, long mirors, or laess curtens in th
litl parlor, but simpl furnicher, plenty of books, a fien pikcher or
too, a stand of flowers in th bae-windo, and, scaterd all about,
th prity gifts which caem from frendly hands, and wer th faerer
for th luving mesejes thae brought.</p>

<p>I don't think th Parian Psyche Laurie gaev lost any of its buety
because John put up th braket it stuud upon; that any uphoesterer
cuud hav draept th plaen muzlin curtens mor graesfuly than
Amy's artistik hand; or that any stor-room wuz ever beter provided
with guud wishes, merry wurds, and hapy hoeps, than that in which
Jo and her muther put away Meg's fue boxes, barrels, and bundles;
and I am moraly surten that th spandy-nue kichen never <em>cuud</em>
hav luukt so cosey and neet if Hannah had not araenjd every pot
and paen a duzen times oever, and laed th fier all redy for lieting,
th mienuet "Mis. Brooke caem hoem." I aulso dout if any yung
maetron ever began lief with so rich a suplie of dusters, hoelders, and
peess-bags; for Beth maed enough to last till th silver weding caem
<span class="pagenum2">298</span>
round, and invented three diferent kiends of dishcloths for th expres
survis of th briedal china.</p>

<p>Peepl hoo hier all thees things dun for them never noe whut
thae looz; for th homeliest tasks get beautified if luving hands do
them, and Meg found so meny proofs of this, that everything in her
small nest, from th kichen roeler to th silver vaess on her parlor
taebl, wuz eloquent of hoem luv and tender forthaut.</p>

<p>Whut hapy times thae had planing together, whut solem shoping
excursions; whut funy mistaeks thae maed, and whut shouts of
lafter aroez oever Laurie's ridicuelus bargans. In his luv of joeks,
this yung jentlman, tho neerly thru colej, wuz as much of
a boy as ever. His last whim had been to bring with him, on his
weekly vizits, sum nue, uesful, and injeenius artikl for th yung
houskeeper. Now a bag of remarkabl cloeths-pins; next, a wunderful
nutmeg-graeter, which fel to pieces at th furst trieal; a nief-cleener
that spoilt all th nievs; or a sweeper that pikt th nap
neetly off th carpet, and left th durt; laebor-saeving soep that tuuk
th skin off wun's hands; infalibl sements which stuk furmly to nuthing
but th finggers of th delooded bieer; and every kiend of tin-waer,
from a toy saevings-bank for od penys, to a wunderful boiler which
wuud wosh artikls in its oen steem, with every prospekt of exploeding
in th process.</p>

<p>In vaen Meg begd him to stop. John laft at him, and Jo
called him "Mr. Toodls." He wuz possessed with a maenia for patronizing
Yankee injenueity, and seeing his frends fitly furnisht forth.
So eech week beheld sum fresh absurdity.</p>

<p>Everything wuz dun at last, eeven to Amy's araenjing diferent culord
soeps to mach th diferent culord rooms, and Beth's setting
th taebl for th furst meel.</p>

<p>"Ar U satisfied? Duz it seem liek hoem, and do U feel as
if U should be hapy heer?" askt Mrs. March, as she and her
dauter went thru th nue kingdom, arm-in-arm; for just then
thae seemd to cling together mor tenderly than ever.</p>

<p>"Yes, muther, perfectly satisfied, thanks to U all, and <em>so</em> hapy
that I can't tauk about it," anserd Meg, with a luuk that wuz beter
than wurds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">299</span>
"If she oenly had a survant or too it wuud be all riet," sed Amy,
cuming out of th parlor, whaer she had been trieing to desied whether
th bronze Murkery luukt best on th whotnot or th mantl-peess.</p>

<p>"Muther and I hav taukt that oever, and I hav maed up mi
miend to tri her wae furst. Thaer wil be so litl to do, that, with
Lotty to run mi errands and help me heer and thaer, I shal oenly
hav enough wurk to keep me from geting laezy or hoemsik," anserd
Meg tranquilly.</p>

<p>"Sallie Moffat has foer," began Amy.</p>

<p>"If Meg had foer th hous wouldn't hoeld them, and master and
missis wuud hav to camp in th garden," broek in Jo, hoo, enveloped
in a big bloo pinafore, wuz giving th last polish to th dor-handls.</p>

<p>"Sallie isn't a puur man's wief, and meny maeds ar in keeping
with her fien establishment. Meg and John begin humbly, but I hav
a feeling that thaer wil be qiet as much hapynes in th litl hous
as in th big wun. It's a graet mistaek for yung gurls liek Meg to
leev themselvs nuthing to do but dres, giv orders, and gosip.
When I wuz furst marryd, I uezd to long for mi nue cloeths to waer
out or get torn, so that I miet hav th plezher of mending them;
for I got hartily sik of dooing fansy wurk and tending mi poket
hankerchif."</p>

<p>"Whi didn't U go into th kichen and maek meses, as Sallie
sez she duz, to amuez herself, tho thae never turn out wel, and
th survants laf at her," sed Meg.</p>

<p>"I did, after a whiel; not to 'mes,' but to lurn of Hannah how
things should be dun, that mi survants need <em>not</em> laf at me. It
wuz plae then; but thaer caem a tiem when I wuz truly graetful that
I not oenly possessed th wil but th power to cuuk hoelsum food
for mi litl gurls, and help mieself when I cuud no longer afford to
hier help. U begin at th uther end, Meg, deer; but th lesons
U lurn now wil be of uez to U by and by, when John is a richer
man, for th mistres of a hous, however splendid, should noe how
wurk aut to be dun, if she wishes to be wel and onestly survd."</p>

<p>"Yes, muther, I'm shuur of that," sed Meg, lisening respektfuly to
th litl lecture; for th best of wimen wil hoeld forth upon th all-absorbing
<span class="pagenum2">300</span>
subjekt of houskeeping. "Do U noe I liek this room
moest of all in mi baeby-hous," aded Meg, a mienuet after, as thae went
upstaers, and she luukt into her wel-stord linen-clozet.</p>

<p>Beth wuz thaer, laeing th snoey piels smoothly on th shelvs,
and exulting oever th guudly arae. All three laft as Meg spoek;
for that linen-clozet wuz a joek. U see, having sed that if Meg
marryd "that Brooke" she shouldn't hav a sent of her muny,
Ant March wuz rather in a qondary, when tiem had appeased her
rath and maed her repent her vow. She never broek her wurd,
and wuz much exercised in her miend how to get round it, and at last
deviezd a plan whaerbi she cuud satisfi herself. Mrs. Carrol, Florence's
maama, wuz orderd to bie, hav maed, and markt, a jenerus
suplie of hous and taebl linen, and send it as <em>her</em> prezent,
all of which wuz faethfuly dun; but th seecret leekt out, and wuz
graetly enjoyd by th family; for Ant March tried to luuk utterly
unconshus, and insisted that she cuud giv nuthing but th oeld-fashond
pearls, long promist to th furst bried.</p>

<p>"That's a housewifely taest which I am glad to see. I had a
yung frend hoo set up houskeeping with six sheets, but she had
fingger boels for company, and that satisfied her," sed Mrs. March,
pating th damask taebl-cloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of
thaer fiennes.</p>

<p>"I haeven't a singgl fingger-boel, but this is a 'set out' that wil last
me all mi daes, Hannah sez;" and Meg luukt qiet contented, as
wel she miet.</p>

<p>"Toodls is cuming," cried Jo from beloe; and thae all went doun
to meet Laurie, hoos weekly vizit wuz an important event in thaer
qieet lievs.</p>

<p>A taul, braud-shouldered yung felo, with a cropt hed, a felt-basin
of a hat, and a fli-away coet, caem tramping doun th roed at
a graet paess, waukt oever th loe fenss without stoping to oepen th
gaet, straet up to Mrs. March, with boeth hands out, and a harty—</p>

<p>"Heer I am, muther! Yes, it's all riet."</p>

<p>Th last wurds wer in anser to th luuk th elder laedy gaev him;
a kiendly qeschoning luuk, which th handsum ies met so frankly
that th litl serremoeny cloezd, as uezhual, with a mutherly kis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">301</span>
"For Mrs. John Brooke, with th maeker's congrachulaeshons and compliments.
Bles U, Beth! Whut a refreshing spektakl U ar, Jo.
Amy, U ar geting aultogether too handsum for a singgl laedy."</p>

<p>As Laurie spoek, he deliverd a broun paeper parsel to Meg, puuld
Beth's haer-ribon, staerd at Jo's big pinafore, and fel into an atitued
of mok rapcher befor Amy, then shuuk hands all round, and every
wun began to tauk.</p>

<p>"Whaer is John?" askt Meg anxiously.</p>

<p>"Stopt to get th liesenss for to-morro, maa'am."</p>

<p>"Which sied wun th last mach, Teddy?" inqierd Jo, hoo persisted
in feeling an interest in manly sports, despiet her nienteen
yeers.</p>

<p>"Ours, of corss. Wish U'd been thaer to see."</p>

<p>"How is th luvly Mis Randal?" askt Amy, with a significant
smiel.</p>

<p>"Mor crooel than ever; don't U see how I'm piening away?"
and Laurie gaev his braud chest a sounding slap and heevd a melodramatik
sie.</p>

<p>"Whut's th last joek? Undo th bundle and see, Meg," sed
Beth, ieing th noby parsel with cueriosity.</p>

<p>"It's a uesful thing to hav in th hous in caess of fier or theevs,"
obzurvd Laurie, as a wochman's ratl apeerd, amid th lafter
of th gurls.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 528px;">

<p>"Any tiem when John is away, and U get frietend, Mrs. Meg,
just swing that out of th frunt windo, and it wil rouz th naeborhuud
in a jiffy. Niess thing, isn't it?" and Laurie gaev them a sampl
of its powers that maed them cuver up thaer eers.</p>

<p>"Thaer's gratitood for U! and speeking of gratitood remiends
me to menshon that U mae thank Hannah for saeving yuur weding-caek
from destrukshon. I saw it going into yuur hous as I caem by,
and if she hadn't defended it manfuly I'd hav had a pik at it, for
it luukt liek a remarkably plummy wun."</p>

<p>"I wunder if U wil ever gro up, Laurie," sed Meg, in a maetronly
toen.</p>

<p>"I'm dooing mi best, maa'am, but can't get much hieer, I'm
afraed, as six feet is about all men can do in thees dejeneraet daes,"
<span class="pagenum2">302</span>
responded th yung jentlman, hoos hed wuz about level with
th litl shandeleer. "I supoez it wuud be profanation to eat anything
in this spick and span nue bower, so, as I'm tremendously
hunggry, I propoez an ajurnment," he aded prezently.</p>

<p>"Muther and I ar going to waet for John. Thaer ar sum last
things to setl," sed Meg, busling away.</p>

<p>"Beth and I ar going oever to Kity Bryant's to get mor flowers
for to-morro," aded Amy, tieing a picturesque hat oever her picturesque
curls, and enjoying th efekt as much as anybody.</p>

<p>"Cum, Jo, don't dezurt a felo. I'm in such a staet of exauschon
I can't get hoem without help. Don't taek off yuur apron,
whotever U do; it's peculiarly becuming," sed Laurie, as Jo
bestoed his especial avurzhon in her capacious poket, and oferd
him her arm to suport his feebl steps.</p>

<p>"Now, Teddy, I wont to tauk seeriusly to U about to-morro,"
began Jo, as thae stroeld away together. "U <em>must</em> promis to
behaev wel, and not cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">303</span>
"Not a prank."</p>

<p>"And don't sae funy things when we aut to be soeber."</p>

<p>"I never do; U ar th wun for that."</p>

<p>"And I implor U not to luuk at me duuring th serremoeny; I
shal surtenly laf if U do."</p>

<p>"U wun't see me; U'll be crieing so hard that th thik fog
round U wil obscuer th prospekt."</p>

<p>"I never cri unles for sum graet aflikshon."</p>

<p>"Such as feloes going to colej, hae?" cut in Laurie, with a
suggestive laf.</p>

<p>"Don't be a peacock. I oenly moend a trifle to keep th gurls
company."</p>

<p>"Exaktly. I sae, Jo, how is grandpa this week; prity aemiabl?"</p>

<p>"Verry; whi, hav U got into a scraep, and wont to noe how
he'll taek it?" askt Jo rather sharply.</p>

<p>"Now, Jo, do U think I'd luuk yuur muther in th faess, and sae
'All riet,' if it wasn't?" and Laurie stopt short, with an injerd
aer.</p>

<p>"No, I don't."</p>

<p>"Then don't go and be suspishus; I oenly wont sum muny,"
sed Laurie, wauking on again, appeased by her harty toen.</p>

<p>"U spend a graet deel, Teddy."</p>

<p>"Bles U, <em>I</em> don't spend it; it spends itself, sumhow, and is
gon befor I noe it."</p>

<p>"U ar so jenerus and kiend-hearted that U let peepl borrow,
and can't sae 'No' to any wun. We hurd about Henshaw, and all
U did for him. If U aulwaes spent muny in that wae, no wun
wuud blaem U," sed Jo wormly.</p>

<p>"O, he maed a mounten out of a moel-hil. U wouldn't hav
me let that fien felo wurk himself to deth, just for th wont of a
litl help, when he is wurth a duzen of us laezy chaps, wuud U?"</p>

<p>"Of corss not; but I don't see th uez of yuur having seventeen
waestcoets, endles nekties, and a nue hat every tiem U cum
hoem. I thaut U'd got oever th dandy period; but every now
and then it braeks out in a nue spot. Just now it's th fashon to be
hidius,—to maek yuur hed luuk liek a scrubing-brush, waer a
<span class="pagenum2">304</span>
straet-jaket, orenj gluvs, and clumping, square-toed boots. If it
wuz cheep ugliness, I'd sae nuthing; but it costs as much as th
uther, and I don't get any satisfakshon out of it."</p>

<p>Laurie throo bak his hed, and laft so hartily at this attack,
that th felt-basin fel off, and Jo waukt on it, which insult oenly
afforded him an oportuenity for expatiating on th advantejes of a
ruf-and-redy costume, as he foelded up th maltreted hat, and
stuft it into his poket.</p>

<p>"Don't lecture any mor, thaer's a guud soel! I hav enough all
thru th week, and liek to enjoy mieself when I cum hoem. I'll
get mieself up regardles of expense, to-morro, and be a satisfakshon
to mi frends."</p>

<p>"I'll leev U in peess if U'll <em>oenly</em> let yuur haer gro. I'm
not aristocratic, but I do objekt to being seen with a purson hoo
luuks liek a yung priez-fieter," obzurvd Jo seveerly.</p>

<p>"This unasueming stiel promoets study; that's whi we adopt it,"
returnd Laurie, hoo surtenly cuud not be accused of vanity, having
voluntaerily sacrifiest a handsum curly crop to th demand for qorter-of-an-inch-long
stubl.</p>

<p>"By th wae, Jo, I think that litl Parker is reealy geting desperat
about Amy. He tauks of her constantly, riets poetry, and moons
about in a moest suspishus maner. He'd beter nip his litl pashon
in th bud, hadn't he?" aded Laurie, in a confidenshal, elder-brutherly
toen, after a mienuet's silence.</p>

<p>"Of corss he had; we don't wont any mor marrying in this
family for yeers to cum. Mursy on us, whut <em>ar</em> th children thinking
of?" and Jo luukt as much scandalized as if Amy and litl
Parker wer not yet in thaer teens.</p>

<p>"It's a fast aej, and I don't noe whut we ar cuming to, maa'am.
U ar a meer infant, but U'll go next, Jo, and we'll be left
lamenting," sed Laurie, shaeking his hed oever th dejenerasy of th
times.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmd; I'm not wun of th agreeabl sort. Noebody
wil wont me, and it's a mursy, for thaer should aulwaes be wun oeld
maed in a family."</p>

<p>"U wun't giv any wun a chanss," sed Laurie, with a sidelong
<span class="pagenum2">305</span>
glanss, and a litl mor culor than befor in his sunburnt faess.
"U wun't sho th soft sied of yuur carrakter; and if a felo gets
a peep at it by accident, and can't help shoeing that he lieks it, U
treat him as Mrs. Gummidge did her sweetheart,—thro coeld wauter
oever him,—and get so thorny no wun dares tuch or luuk at U."</p>

<p>"I don't liek that sort of thing; I'm too busy to be wuryd with
nonsenss, and I think it's dredful to braek up familys so. Now
don't sae any mor about it; Meg's weding has turnd all our heds,
and we tauk of nuthing but luvers and such absurdities. I don't wish
to get cros, so let's chaenj th subjekt;" and Jo luukt qiet redy
to fling coeld wauter on th slightest provocaeshon.</p>

<p>Whotever his feelings miet hav been, Laurie found a vent for
them in a long loe whisl, and th feerful prediction, as thae parted
at th gaet, "Mark mi wurds, Jo, U'll go next."</p>

<p class="h2a">Th Furst Weding.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Th</span> June roezes oever th porch wer awake briet and eerly on that
morning, rejoising with all thaer harts in th cloudles sunshine, liek
frendly litl naebors, as thae wer. Qiet flusht with exsietment
wer thaer rudy faeses, as thae swung in th wiend, whispering to wun
anuther whut thae had seen; for sum peept in at th diening-room
windoes, whaer th feest wuz spred, sum cliemd up to nod and
smiel at th sisters as thae drest th bried, others waevd a welcum
to thoes hoo caem and went on vaerius errands in garden, porch, and
haul, and all, from th roezyest fuul-bloen flower to th palest baeby-bud,
oferd thaer tribute of buety and fraegranss to th jentl mistres
hoo had luvd and tended them so long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">307</span>
Meg luukt verry liek a roez herself; for all that wuz best and sweetest
in hart and soel seemd to bloom into her faess that dae, maeking it
faer and tender, with a charm mor buetiful than buety. Neether
silk, laess, nor orenj-flowers wuud she hav. "I don't wont to luuk
straenj or fixed up to-dae," she sed. "I don't wont a fashonabl
weding, but oenly thoes about me hoom I luv, and to them I wish to
luuk and be mi familyar self."</p>

<p>So she maed her weding goun herself, soeing into it th tender
hoeps and inosent roemanses of a gurlish hart. Her sisters braeded
up her prity haer, and th oenly ornaments she wor wer th lilys of
th valy, which "her John" liked best of all th flowers that groo.</p>

<p>"U <em>do</em> luuk just liek our oen deer Meg, oenly so verry sweet and
luvly that I should hug U if it wouldn't crumpl yuur dres," cried
Amy, survaeing her with deliet, when all wuz dun.</p>

<p>"Then I am satisfied. But pleez hug and kis me, every wun, and
don't miend mi dres; I wont a graet meny crumpls of this sort put
into it to-dae;" and Meg oepend her arms to her sisters, hoo clung
about her with April faeses for a mienuet, feeling that th nue luv had
not chaenjd th oeld.</p>

<p>"Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him, and then to stae a
fue minits with faather qieetly in th study;" and Meg ran doun to
perform thees litl serremoenys, and then to folo her muther whaerever
she went, conshus that, in spiet of th smiels on th mutherly
faess, thaer wuz a seecret sorro hid in th mutherly hart at th fliet
of th furst burd from th nest.</p>

<p>As th yungger gurls stand together, giving th last tuches to thaer
simpl toilet, it mae be a guud tiem to tel of a fue chaenjes which
three yeers hav raut in thaer apeeranss; for all ar luuking thaer
best just now.</p>

<p>Jo's angles ar much sofend; she has lurnd to carry herself with
eez, if not graess. Th curly crop has lengthened into a thik coil,
mor becuming to th small hed atop of th taul figuer. Thaer is a
fresh culor in her broun cheeks, a soft shien in her ies, and oenly
jentl wurds faul from her sharp tung to-dae.</p>

<p>Beth has groen slender, pale, and mor qieet than ever; th buetiful,
kiend ies ar larjer, and in them lies an expreshon that saddens
<span class="pagenum2">308</span>
wun, aultho it is not sad itself. It is th shado of paen which tuches
th yung faess with such pathetik paeshenss; but Beth seldom complaens,
and aulwaes speeks hoepfuly of "being beter soon."</p>

<p>Amy is with trooth considerd "th flower of th family;" for at
sixteen she has th aer and bearing of a fuul-groen wuuman—not buetiful,
but possessed of that indescriebabl charm called graess. Wun
saw it in th liens of her figuer, th maek and moeshon of her hands,
th flo of her dres, th droop of her haer,—unconshus, yet harmoenius,
and as atraktiv to meny as buety itself. Amy's noez still
aflikted her, for it never <em>wuud</em> gro Grecian; so did her mouth,
being too wied, and having a desieded chin. Thees ofending feechers
gaev carrakter to her hoel faess, but she never cuud see it, and consoeld
herself with her wunderfuly faer complexion, keen bloo ies, and
curls, mor goelden and abundant than ever.</p>

<p>All three wor suits of thin silver grae (thaer best gouns for th
sumer), with blush-roezes in haer and bosom; and all three luukt
just whut thae wer,—fresh-faest, hapy-hearted gurls, pausing a
moement in thaer busy lievs to red with wistful ies th sweetest
chapter in th roemanss of wuumanhuud.</p>

<p>Thaer wer to be no serremoenius performances, everything wuz to
be as nacheral and homelike as posibl; so when Ant March arrived,
she wuz scandalized to see th bried cum runing to welcum and
leed her in, to fiend th briedgroom fasening up a garland that had
faulen doun, and to cach a glimps of th paturnal minister marching
upstaers with a graev countenanss, and a wien-botl under eech arm.</p>

<p>"Upon mi wurd, heer's a staet of things!" cried th oeld laedy,
taeking th seet of onor prepaerd for her, and setling th foelds of her
lavender <i>moire</i> with a graet rusl. "U oughtn't to be seen till
th last mienuet, chield."</p>

<p>"I'm not a sho, aunty, and no wun is cuming to staer at me, to
criticise mi dres, or count th cost of mi lunchon. I'm too hapy
to caer whut any wun sez or thinks, and I'm going to hav mi litl
weding just as I liek it. John, deer, heer's yuur hamer;" and
away went Meg to help "that man" in his hiely improper employment.</p>

<p>
Mr. Brooke didn't eeven sae "Thank U," but as he stoopt for th
<span class="pagenum2">309</span>
unromantik tool, he kist his litl bried behind th foelding-dor, with
a luuk that maed Ant March whisk out her poket-hankerchif, with
a suden due in her sharp oeld ies.</p>

<p>A crash, a cri, and a laf from Laurie, accompanied by th indecorus
exclamation, "Jupiter Ammon! Jo's upset th caek again!"
cauzd a moementaery flury, which wuz hardly oever when a flok of
cuzins arrived, and "th party caem in," as Beth uezd to sae when a
chield.</p>

<p>"Don't let that yung jieant cum neer me; he wurys me wurss
than moskeetoes," whisperd th oeld laedy to Amy, as th rooms fild,
and Laurie's blak hed towered abuv th rest.</p>

<p>"He has promist to be verry guud to-dae, and he <em>can</em> be perfectly
elegant if he lieks," returnd Amy, glieding away to worn Hercules to
bewaer of th dragon, which worning cauzd him to haunt th oeld laedy
with a devoeshon that neerly distracted her.</p>

<p>Thaer wuz no briedal procession, but a suden silence fel upon th
room as Mr. March and th yung paer tuuk thaer plaeses under th
green arch. Muther and sisters gatherd cloez, as if loeth to giv
Meg up; th faatherly vois broek mor than wunss, which oenly seemd
to maek th survis mor buetiful and solem; th briedgroom's
hand trembld vizibly, and no wun hurd his replies; but Meg luukt
straet up in her huzband's ies, and sed, "I wil!" with such tender
trust in her oen faess and vois that her muther's hart rejoist, and
Ant March snift aubibly.</p>

<p>Jo did <em>not</em> cri, tho she wuz verry neer it wunss, and wuz oenly saevd
from a demonstraeshon by th conshusnes that Laurie wuz staering
fixedly at her, with a comikal mixcher of merriment and emotion in
his wiked blak ies. Beth kept her faess hiden on her muther's
shoulder, but Amy stuud liek a graesful stachoo, with a moest becuming
rae of sunshine tuching her whiet forhed and th flower in her haer.</p>

<p>It wasn't at all th thing, I'm afraed, but th mienuet she wuz faerly
marryd, Meg cried, "Th furst kis for Marmee!" and, turning, gaev
it with her hart on her lips. Duuring th next fifteen minits she
luukt mor liek a roez than ever, for every wun availed themselvs of
thaer privilejes to th fuulest extent, from Mr. Laurence to oeld Hannah,
hoo, adornd with a hed-dres fearfully and wunderfuly maed, fel
<span class="pagenum2">310</span>
upon her in th haul, crieing, with a sob and a chukl, "Bles U,
deary, a hundred times! Th caek ain't hurt a miet, and everything
luuks luvly."</p>

<p>Everybody cleerd up after that, and sed sumthing brilliant, or
tried to, which did just as wel, for lafter is redy when harts ar
liet. Thaer wuz no displae of gifts, for thae wer aulredy in th
litl hous, nor wuz thaer an elaboraet brekfast, but a plentiful lunch
of caek and froot, drest with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Ant
March shrugd and smield at wun anuther when wauter, lemonaed, and
cofy wer found to be th oenly sorts of nektar which th three Hebes
carried round. No wun sed anything, however, till Laurie, hoo insisted
on surving th bried, apeerd befor her, with a loeded salver in his
hand and a puzzled expreshon on his faess.</p>

<p>"Has Jo smashed all th botls by accident?" he whisperd, "or
am I meerly laeboring under a deloozhon that I saw sum lieing about
looss this morning?"</p>

<p>"No; yuur grandfaather kiendly oferd us his best, and Ant March
akchualy sent sum, but faather put away a litl for Beth, and despacht
th rest to th Soeljers' Hoem. U noe he thinks that wien should
be uezd oenly in ilnes, and muther sez that neether she nor her
dauters wil ever ofer it to any yung man under her roof."</p>

<p>Meg spoek seeriusly, and expected to see Laurie froun or laf;
but he did neether, for after a qik luuk at her, he sed, in his impechu’us
wae, "I liek that! for I've seen enough harm dun to wish uther
wimen wuud think as U do."</p>

<p>"U ar not maed wiez by expeeri’enss, I hoep?" and thaer wuz an
anxious accent in Meg's vois.</p>

<p>"No; I giv U mi wurd for it. Don't think too wel of me,
eether; this is not wun of mi temptaeshons. Being brought up whaer
wien is as common as wauter, and aulmoest as harmles, I don't caer for
it; but when a prity gurl ofers it, wun doesn't liek to refuez, U see."</p>

<p>"But U wil, for th saek of others, if not for yuur oen. Cum,
Laurie, promis, and giv me wun mor reezon to call this th hapyest
dae of mi lief."</p>

<p>A demand so suden and so seerius maed th yung man hezitaet
a moement, for ridicuel is ofen harder to baer than self-denieal. Meg
<span class="pagenum2">311</span>
knew that if he gaev th promis he wuud keep it at all costs; and, feeling
her power, uezd it as a wuuman mae for her frend's guud. She did
not speek, but she luukt up at him with a faess maed verry eloquent
by hapynes, and a smiel which sed, "No wun can refuez me anything
to-dae." Laurie surtenly cuud not; and, with an ansering
smiel, he gaev her his hand, saeing hartily, "I promis, Mrs.
Brooke!"</p>

<p>"I thank U, verry, verry much."</p>

<p>"And I drink 'long lief to yuur rezolooshon,' Teddy," cried Jo, baptiezing
him with a splash of lemonaed, as she waevd her glas, and
beemd approvingly upon him.</p>

<p>So th toest wuz drunk, th plej maed, and loyaly kept, in spiet
of meny temptaeshons; for, with instinktiv wizdom, th gurls had seezd
a hapy moement to do thaer frend a survis, for which he thankt
them all his lief.</p>

<p>After lunch, peepl stroeld about, by toos and threes, thru
hous and garden, enjoying th sunshine without and within. Meg
and John happened to be standing together in th midl of th gras-plot,
when Laurie wuz seezd with an inspiraeshon which put th finishing
tuch to this unfashonabl weding.</p>

<p>"All th marryd peepl taek hands and danss round th nue-maed
huzband and wief, as th Germans do, whiel we bachelors
and spinsters pranss in cupls outsied!" cried Laurie, promenading
doun th path with Amy, with such infectious spirit and skil that
every wun else foloed thaer exampl without a murmer. Mr. and
Mrs. March, Ant and Unkl Carrol, began it; others rapidly joind
in; eeven Sallie Moffat, after a moement's hezitaeshon, throo her traen
oever her arm, and whiskt Ned into th ring. But th crouning joek
wuz Mr. Laurence and Ant March; for when th stately oeld jentlman
<i>chasséed</i> solemly up to th oeld laedy, she just tukt her caen
under her arm, and hopt briskly away to join hands with th rest,
and danss about th briedal paer, whiel th yung foeks pervaeded th
garden, liek butterflies on a midsumer dae.</p>

<p>Wont of breth brought th impromptoo baul to a cloez, and then
peepl began to go.</p>

<p>"I wish U wel, mi deer, I hartily wish U wel; but I think
<span class="pagenum2">312</span>
U'll be sorry for it," sed Ant March to Meg, ading to th briedgroom,
as he led her to th carrej, "U've got a treasure, yung
man, see that U dezurv it."</p>

<p>"That is th prityest weding I've been to for an aej, Ned, and I
don't see whi, for thaer wasn't a bit of stiel about it," obzurvd Mrs.
Moffat to her huzband, as thae droev away.</p>

<p>"Laurie, mi lad, if U ever wont to indulj in this sort of thing,
get wun of thoes litl gurls to help U, and I shal be perfectly satisfied,"
sed Mr. Laurence, setling himself in his eezy-chaer to rest,
after th exsietment of th morning.</p>

<p>"I'll do mi best to gratifi U, sur," wuz Laurie's unuezhualy dutiful
replie, as he carefully unpinned th posy Jo had put in his buton-hoel.</p>

<p>Th litl hous wuz not far away, and th oenly briedal jurny Meg
had wuz th qieet wauk with John, from th oeld hoem to th nue.
When she caem doun, luuking liek a prity Quakeress in her duv-culord
suit and straw bonnet tied with whiet, thae all gatherd about
her to sae "guud-by," as tenderly as if she had been going to maek
th grand tour.</p>

<p>"Don't feel that I am separaeted from U, Marmee deer, or that I
luv U any th les for luving John so much," she sed, clinging to
her muther, with fuul ies, for a moement. "I shal cum every dae,
faather, and expect to keep mi oeld plaess in all yuur harts, tho I
<em>am</em> marryd. Beth is going to be with me a graet deel, and th uther
gurls wil drop in now and then to laf at mi houskeeping strugls.
Thank U all for mi hapy weding-dae. Guud-by, guud-by!"</p>

<p>Thae stuud woching her, with faeses fuul of luv and hoep and
tender pride, as she waukt away, leening on her huzband's arm, with
her hands fuul of flowers, and th June sunshine brietening her hapy
faess,—and so Meg's marryd lief began.</p>

<p class="h2a">Artistik Atempts.</p>

<p><span class="smc">It</span> taeks peepl a long tiem to lurn th diferenss between talent
and jeenyus, especially ambishus yung men and wimen. Amy wuz
lurning this distinkshon thru much tribulation; for, mistaeking enthusiasm
for inspiraeshon, she atempted every branch of art with yoothful
audasity. For a long tiem thaer wuz a lul in th "mud-pie"
business, and she devoeted herself to th fienest pen-and-ink drawing,
in which she shoed such taest and skil that her graesful handiwork
proovd boeth plezant and profitabl. But oeverstraend ies soon
cauzd pen and ink to be laed asied for a boeld atempt at poeker-skeching.
Whiel this attack lasted, th family livd in constant feer
of a conflagraeshon; for th odor of burning wuud pervaeded th hous at
<span class="pagenum2">314</span>
all ours; smoek ishood from attic and shed with alarming freeqensys,
red-hot poekers lae about promiscuously, and Hannah never went
to bed without a pael of wauter and th diner-bel at her dor, in caess
of fier. Raphael's faess wuz found boeldly exsecueted on th under sied
of th moulding-bord, and Bacchus on th hed of a beer-barrel;
a chanting cherrub adornd th cuver of th sugar-buket, and atempts
to portray Romeo and Juliet suplied kindlings for sum
tiem.</p>

<p>From fier to oil wuz a nacheral tranzishon for burnt finggers, and Amy
fel to paenting with undiminished ardor. An artist frend fited her
out with his cast-off palettes, brushes, and culors; and she daubd
away, producing pastoral and mareen vues such as wer never seen
on land or see. Her monstrositys in th wae of catl wuud hav
taeken priezes at an agriculcheral faer; and th perilous piching of her
vesels wuud hav produced see-siknes in th moest nautikal obzurver,
if th uter disregard to all noen rools of shipbuilding and riging
had not convulst him with lafter at th furst glanss. Swarthy
boys and dark-ied Madonnas, staering at U from wun corner of
th studio, sugjested Murillo; oily-broun shadoes of faeses, with a
luurid streek in th rong plaess, ment Rembrandt; buxom laedys
and dropsical infants, Rubens; and Turner apeerd in tempests of
bloo thunder, orenj lieting, broun raen, and purpl clouds, with
a tomaeto-culord splash in th midl, which miet be th sun or a
buoy, a saelor's shurt or a king's roeb, as th spektaetor pleezd.</p>

</div>

<p>Charcoel portraits caem next; and th entier family hung in a row (noun),
luuking as wield and crocky as if just evoked from a coel-bin. Sofend
into craeon skeches, thae did beter; for th likenesses wer
guud, and Amy's haer, Jo's noez, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's ies
wer pronounced "wunderfuly fien." A return to clay and plaster
foloed, and goestly casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of
th hous, or tumbld off clozet-shelvs on to peepl's heds. Children
wer entiest in as models, till thaer incoeheerent accounts of her
misteerius dooings cauzd Mis Amy to be regarded in th liet of a
yung oegres. Her eforts in this lien, however, wer brought to an
abrupt cloez by an untord accident, which qencht her ardor.
Uther models faeling her for a tiem, she undertuuk to cast her oen
<span class="pagenum2">315</span>
prity fuut, and th family wer wun dae alarmd by an unurthly
bumping and screeming, and runing to th rescue, found th yung
enthusiast hoping wieldly about th shed, with her fuut held fast in a
paen-fuul of plaster, which had hardend with unexpekted rapidity.
With much dificulty and
sum daenjer she wuz dug
out; for Jo wuz so oevercum
with lafter whiel she
excavated, that her nief
went too far, cut th puur
fuut, and left a lasting memorial
of wun artistik atempt,
at leest.</p>

<p>After this Amy subsided,
till a maenia for skeching
from naechuur set her to haunting
river, feeld, and wuud,
for picturesque studys, and
sieing for rooins to copy.
She caut endles colds sitting
on damp gras to book
"a delicious bit," compoezd
of a stoen, a stump, wun
mushroom, and a broeken
mullein-stauk, or "a hevenly
mas of clouds," that
luukt liek a chois displae
of fether-beds when
dun. She sacrifiest her complexion floeting on th river in th
midsumer sun, to study liet and shaed, and got a rinks oever her
noez, trieing after "points of siet," or whotever th sqint-and-string
performance is called.</p>

<p>If "jeenyus is eternal paeshenss," as Michael Angelo affirms, Amy
surtenly had sum claem to th divine atribuet, for she perseveerd in
spiet of all obstakls, faeluers, and discurejments, furmly beleeving
that in tiem she should do sumthing wurthy to be called "hie art."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">316</span>
She wuz lurning, dooing, and enjoying uther things, meenwhiel, for
she had rezolvd to be an atraktiv and accomplished wuuman, eeven
if she never becaem a graet artist. Heer she succeeded beter; for
she wuz wun of thoes hapily creaeted beings hoo pleez without efort,
maek frends everywhaer, and taek lief so graesfuly and eezily that
les forchunat soels ar tempted to beleev that such ar born under a
luky star. Everybody liked her, for amung her guud gifts wuz takt.
She had an instinktiv senss of whut wuz pleezing and proper, aulwaes
sed th riet thing to th riet purson, did just whut suited th tiem
and plaess, and wuz so self-possessed that her sisters uezd to sae, "If
Amy went to cort without any rehursal beforehand, she'd noe
exaktly whut to do."</p>

<p>Wun of her weekneses wuz a dezier to moov in "our best soesieety,"
without being qiet shuur whut th <em>best</em> reealy wuz. Muny, pozishon,
fashonabl accomplishments, and elegant maners wer moest dezierabl
things in her ies, and she liked to asoeshiat with thoes hoo possessed
them, ofen mistaeking th faulss for th troo, and admiering whut wuz
not admerabl. Never forgeting that by burth she wuz a jentlwuuman,
she cultivaeted her aristocratic taests and feelings, so that when th
oportuenity caem she miet be redy to taek th plaess from which
poverty now exclooded her.</p>

<p>"Mi laedy," as her frends called her, sincerely dezierd to be a jenuein
laedy, and wuz so at hart, but had yet to lurn that muny cannot
bie refienment of naechuur, that rank duz not aulwaes confur noebility,
and that troo breeding maeks itself felt in spiet of exturnal drawbacks.</p>

<p>"I wont to ask a faevor of U, maama," Amy sed, cuming in, with
an important aer, wun dae.</p>

<p>"Wel, litl gurl, whut is it?" replied her muther, in hoos ies
th stately yung laedy still remaend "th baeby."</p>

<p>"Our drawing clas braeks up next week, and befor th gurls separet
for th sumer, I wont to ask them out heer for a dae. Thae
ar wield to see th river, skech th broeken bridge, and copy sum of
th things thae admier in mi book. Thae hav been verry kiend to
me in meny waes, and I am graetful, for thae ar all rich, and noe I
am puur, yet thae never maed any diferenss."</p>

<p>"Whi should thae?" and Mrs. March put th qeschon with whut
th gurls called her "Maria Theresa aer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">317</span>
"U noe as wel as I that it <em>duz</em> maek a diferenss with neerly
every wun, so don't rufl up, liek a deer, mutherly hen, when yuur
chikens get pecked by smarter burds; th ugly dukling turnd out
a swan, U noe;" and Amy smield without bitterness, for she possessed
a hapy temper and hoepful spirit.</p>

<p>Mrs. March laft, and smoothd doun her maturnal pride as
she askt,—</p>

<p>"Wel, mi swan, whut is yuur plan?"</p>

<p>"I should liek to ask th gurls out to lunch next week, to taek them
a driev to th plaeses thae wont to see, a row (noun) on th river, perhaps,
and maek a litl artistik <i>fête</i> for them."</p>

<p>"That luuks feezibl. Whut do U wont for lunch? Caek, sandwiches,
froot, and cofy wil be all that is nesesaery, I supoez?"</p>

<p>"O deer, no! we must hav coeld tung and chiken, French
chocolat and iess-creem, besieds. Th gurls ar uezd to such things,
and I wont mi lunch to be proper and elegant, tho I <em>do</em> wurk for
mi living."</p>

<p>"How meny yung laedys ar thaer?" askt her muther, begining
to luuk soeber.</p>

<p>"Twelve or foerteen in th clas, but I daer sae thae wun't all
cum."</p>

<p>"Bles me, chield, U wil hav to charter an omnibus to carry
them about."</p>

<p>"Whi, muther, how <em>can</em> U think of such a thing? Not mor than
six or aet wil probably cum, so I shal hier a beech-wagon, and
borrow Mr. Laurence's cherry-bounss." (Hannah's pronunciation of
<i>char-à-banc</i>.)</p>

<p>"All this wil be expensive, Amy."</p>

<p>"Not verry; I've calcuelaeted th cost, and I'll pae for it mieself."</p>

<p>"Don't U think, deer, that as thees gurls ar uezd to such things,
and th best we can do wil be nuthing nue, that sum simpler plan
wuud be plezanter to them, as a chaenj, if nuthing mor, and much
beter for us than buying or borrowing whut we don't need, and attempting
a stiel not in keeping with our surcumstanses?"</p>

<p>"If I can't hav it as I liek, I don't caer to hav it at all. I noe
that I can carry it out perfectly wel, if U and th gurls wil help a
<span class="pagenum2">318</span>
litl; and I don't see whi I can't if I'm wiling to pae for it," sed
Amy, with th desizhon which opozishon wuz apt to chaenj into
obstinasy.</p>

<p>Mrs. March knew that expeeri’enss wuz an exselent teecher, and
when it wuz posibl she left her children to lurn aloen th lesons
which she wuud gladly hav maed eezyer, if thae had not objekted to
taeking advice as much as thae did saults and senna.</p>

<p>"Verry wel, Amy; if yuur hart is set upon it, and U see yuur
wae thru without too graet an outlae of muny, tiem, and temper,
I'll sae no mor. Tauk it oever with th gurls, and whichever wae
U desied, I'll do mi best to help U."</p>

<p>"Thanks, muther; U ar aulwaes <em>so</em> kiend;" and away went Amy
to lae her plan befor her sisters.</p>

<p>Meg agreed at wunss, and promist her aed, gladly ofering anything
she possessed, from her litl hous itself to her verry best sault-spoons.
But Jo fround upon th hoel projekt, and wuud hav nuthing to
do with it at furst.</p>

<p>"Whi in th wurld should U spend yuur muny, wury yuur
family, and turn th hous upsied doun for a parsel of gurls hoo don't
caer a sixpence for U? I thaut U had too much pride and
senss to truckle to any mortal wuuman just because she waers French
boots and rieds in a <i>coupé</i>," sed Jo, hoo, being called from th
tragical cliemax of her novel, wuz not in th best mood for soeshal enterprises.</p>

<p>"I <em>don't</em> truckle, and I haet being patronized as much as U do!"
returnd Amy indignantly, for th too still janggld when such qeschons
aroez. "Th gurls do caer for me, and I for them, and thaer's
a graet deel of kiendnes and senss and talent amung them, in spiet
of whut U call fashonabl nonsenss. U don't caer to maek peepl
liek U, to go into guud soesieety, and cultivaet yuur maners and
taests. I do, and I meen to maek th moest of every chanss that
cums. <em>U</em> can go thru th wurld with yuur elboes out and
yuur noez in th aer, and call it independenss, if U liek. That's
not mi wae."</p>

<p>When Amy wheted her tung and freed her miend she uezhualy got
th best of it, for she seldom faeld to hav common senss on her
<span class="pagenum2">319</span>
sied, whiel Jo carried her luv of liberty and haet of conventionalities
to such an unlimited extent that she nacheraly found herself wuusted
in an arguement. Amy's definishon of Jo's iedeea of independenss wuz
such a guud hit that boeth burst out lafing, and th discushon tuuk
a mor aemiabl turn. Much against her wil, Jo at length consented
to sacrifiess a dae to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister thru whut
she regarded as "a nonsensikal business."</p>

<p>Th invitaeshons wer sent, neerly all accepted, and th foloeing
Monday wuz set apart for th grand event. Hannah wuz out of huemor
because her week's wurk wuz deraenjd, and prophesied that "ef
th washin' and ironin' worn't dun reg'lar nothin' wuud go wel anywheres."
This hich in th maenspring of th domestik masheenery
had a bad efekt upon th hoel concern; but Amy's moto wuz "Nil
desperandum," and having maed up her miend whut to do, she proceeded
to do it in spiet of all obstakls. To begin with, Hannah's
cuuking didn't turn out wel: th chiken wuz tough, th tung too
sault, and th chocolat wouldn't froth properly. Then th caek and
iess cost mor than Amy expected, so did th wagon; and vaerius
uther expenses, which seemd trifling at th outset, counted up rather
alarmingly afterward. Beth got coeld and tuuk to her bed, Meg had
an uenuezhual number of callers to keep her at hoem, and Jo wuz in such
a divided staet of miend that her breakages, accidents, and mistaeks
wer uncomonly nuemerus, seerius, and trieing.</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for muther I never should hav got thru,"
as Amy declaerd afterward, and graetfuly rememberd when "th
best joek of th seezon" wuz entierly forgoten by everybody else.</p>

<p>If it wuz not faer on Monday, th yung laedys wer to cum on
Tuesday,—an araenjment which aggravated Jo and Hannah to th
last degree. On Monday morning th wether wuz in that undecided
staet which is mor exasperaeting than a steady por. It drizzled a
litl, shone a litl, blew a litl, and didn't maek up its miend till it
wuz too laet for any wun else to maek up theirs. Amy wuz up at
daun, husling peepl out of thaer beds and thru thaer breakfasts,
that th hous miet be got in order. Th parlor struk her as luuking
uncomonly shaby; but without stoping to sie for whut she had not,
she skilfully maed th best of whut she had, araenjing chaers oever th
<span class="pagenum2">320</span>
worn plaeses in th carpet, cuvering staens on th wauls with pikchers
fraemd in ievy, and filing up empty corners with hoem-maed statuary,
which gaev an artistik aer to th room, as did th luvly vaeses of
flowers Jo scaterd about.</p>

<p>Th lunch luukt charmingly; and as she survaed it, she sincerely
hoept it wuud taest wel, and that th borrowed glas, china, and
silver wuud get saefly hoem again. Th carrejs wer promist,
Meg and muther wer all redy to do th onors, Beth wuz aebl to
help Hannah behind th seens, Jo had engaejd to be as lievly and
aemiabl as an absent miend, an aeking hed, and a verry desieded disaprooval
of everybody and everything wuud alow, and, as she weerily
drest, Amy cheerd herself with antisipaeshons of th hapy moement,
when, lunch saefly oever, she should driev away with her frends
for an afternoon of artistik deliets; for th "cherry-bounss" and
th broeken bridge wer her strong points.</p>

<p>Then caem too ours of suspenss, duuring which she viebraeted from
parlor to porch, whiel public opinyon vaeryd liek th wethercok.
A smart shower at eleven had evidently qencht th enthusiasm of
th yung laedys hoo wer to arrive at twelve, for noebody caem; and
at too th exausted family sat doun in a blaez of sunshine to consuem
th perishable porshons of th feest, that nuthing miet be lost.</p>

<p>"No dout about th wether to-dae; thae wil surtenly cum, so
we must fli round and be redy for them," sed Amy, as th sun
woek her next morning. She spoek briskly, but in her seecret soel
she wisht she had sed nuthing about Tuesday, for her interest, liek
her caek, wuz geting a litl stael.</p>

<p>"I can't get any lobsters, so U wil hav to do without salad to-dae,"
sed Mr. March, cuming in haf an our laeter, with an expreshon
of plasid despaer.</p>

<p>"Uez th chiken, then; th toughness wun't mater in a salad,"
advised his wief.</p>

<p>"Hannah left it on th kichen-taebl a mienuet, and th kitens
got at it. I'm verry sorry, Amy," aded Beth, hoo wuz still a patroness
of cats.</p>

<p>"Then I <em>must</em> hav a lobster, for tung aloen wun't do," sed
Amy decidedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">321</span>
"Shal I rush into town and demand wun?" askt Jo, with th
magnanimity of a marter.</p>

<p>"U'd cum bringing it hoem under yuur arm, without any paeper,
just to tri me. I'll go mieself," anserd Amy, hoos temper wuz
begining to fael.</p>

<p>Shrouded in a thik vael and armd with a jenteel travelling-basket,
she departed, feeling that a cool driev wuud sooth her rufld spirit,
and fit her for th laebors of th dae. After sum delae, th objekt of
her dezier wuz procured, liekwiez a botl of dresing, to prevent further
lost of tiem at hoem, and off she droev again, wel pleezd with
her oen forthaut.</p>

<p>As th omnibus contained oenly wun uther pasenjer, a sleepy oeld
laedy, Amy poketed her vael, and begield th teedium of th wae by
trieing to fiend out whaer all her muny had gon to. So busy wuz
she with her card fuul of refraktory figuers that she did not obzurv a
nue-comer, hoo entered without stoping th veeikl, till a mascuelin
vois sed, "Guud-morning, Mis March," and, luuking up, she beheld
wun of Laurie's moest elegant colej frends. Furvently hoeping that
he wuud get out befor she did, Amy utterly ignord th basket at
her feet, and, congrachulaeting herself that she had on her nue travelling
dres, returnd th yung man's greeting with her uezhual suavity and
spirit.</p>

<p>Thae got on exselently; for Amy's cheef caer wuz soon set at rest
by lurning that th jentlman wuud leev furst, and she wuz chating
away in a peculiarly lofty straen, when th oeld laedy got out. In
stumbling to th dor, she upset th basket, and—o, horror!—th
lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, wuz reveeld to th hieborn
ies of a Tudor.</p>

<p>"By Jove, she's forgoten her diner!" cried th unconshus
yooth, poeking th scarlet monster into its plaess with his caen, and
prepaering to hand out th basket after th oeld laedy.</p>

<p>"Pleez don't—it's—it's mien," murmerd Amy, with a faess
neerly as red as her fish.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 525px;">
<a name="b125.png" id="b125.png"></a>
<img src="./LitlWimen_files/b125.png" width="525" height="400" alt="Please don&#39;t, it&#39;s mine" title="Please don&#39;t, it&#39;s mine">
</div>

<p>"O, reealy, I beg pardon; it's an uncomonly fien wun, isn't
it?" sed Tudor, with graet presence of miend, and an aer of soeber interest
that did credit to his breeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">322</span>
Amy recuverd herself in a breth, set her basket boeldly on th
seet, and sed, lafing,—</p>

<p>"Don't U wish U wer to hav sum of th salad he's to maek,
and to see th charming yung laedys hoo ar to eat it?"</p>

<p>Now that wuz takt, for too of th rooling foibls of th mascuelin
miend wer tucht: th lobster wuz instantly serounded by a haelo
of pleezing reminisenses, and cueriosity about "th charming yung
laedys" divurted his miend from th comikal mis-hap.</p>

<p>"I supoez he'll laf and joek oever it with Laurie, but I sha'n't
see them; that's a cumfort," thaut Amy, as Tudor bowd and
departed.</p>

<p>She did not menshon this meeting at hoem (tho she discuverd
that, thanks to th upset, her nue dres wuz much damejd by th
rivulets of dresing that meanderd doun th scurt), but went thru
with th preparaeshons which now seemd mor urksum than befor;
and at twelve o'clok all wuz redy again. Feeling that th naebors
wer interested in her moovments, she wisht to efaess th memory
<span class="pagenum2">323</span>
of yesterdae's faeluer by a grand success to-dae; so she orderd th
"cherry-bounss," and droev away in staet to meet and escort her
guests to th banquet.</p>

<p>"Thaer's th rumbl, thae're cuming! I'll go into th porch to
meet them; it luuks hospitabl, and I wont th puur chield to hav a
guud tiem after all her trubl," sed Mrs. March, suiting th akshon to
th wurd. But after wun glanss, she retierd, with an indescriebabl
expreshon, for, luuking qiet lost in th big carrej, sat Amy and wun
yung laedy.</p>

<p>"Run, Beth, and help Hannah cleer haf th things off th taebl;
it wil be too absurd to put a lunchon for twelve befor a singgl gurl,"
cried Jo, hurying away to th loeer reejons, too exsieted to stop eeven
for a laf.</p>

<p>In caem Amy, qiet calm, and delietfuly corjal to th wun guessed
hoo had kept her promis; th rest of th family, being of a dramatik
turn, plaed thaer parts equally wel, and Mis Eliott found them a
moest hilaerius set; for it wuz imposibl to entierly controel th merriment
which possessed them. Th remodelled lunch being gaely
partaken of, th studio and garden vizited, and art discust with
enthusiasm, Amy orderd a buging (alas for th elegant cherry-bounss!)
and droev her frend qieetly about th naeborhuud till
sunset, when "th party went out."</p>

<p>As she caem wauking in, luuking verry tierd, but as compoezd as
ever, she obzurvd that every vestej of th unforchunat <i>fête</i> 
had disapeerd, exsept a suspishus puker about th corners of Jo's 
mouth.</p>

<p>"U've had a luvly afternoon for yuur driev, deer," sed her
muther, as respektfuly as if th hoel twelve had cum.</p>

<p>"Mis Eliott is a verry sweet gurl, and seemd to enjoy herself, I
thaut," obzurvd Beth, with uenuezhual warmth.</p>

<p>"Cuud U spaer me sum of yuur caek? I reealy need sum, I
hav so much company, and I can't maek such delicious stuf as
yuurs," askt Meg soeberly.</p>

<p>"Taek it all; I'm th oenly wun heer hoo lieks sweet things, and it
wil mould befor I can dispoez of it," anserd Amy, thinking with
a sie of th jenerus stor she had laed in for such an end as
this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">324</span>
"It's a pity Laurie isn't heer to help us," began Jo, as thae sat
doun to iess-creem and salad for th second tiem in too daes.</p>

<p>A worning luuk from her muther chekt any further remarks, and
th hoel family aet in heroeik silence, till Mr. March mieldly obzurvd,
"Salad wuz wun of th faevorit dishes of th ancients, and Evelyn"—heer
a jeneral exploezhon of lafter cut short th "history of sallets,"
to th graet serpriez of th lurnd jentlman.</p>

<p>"Bundle everything into a basket and send it to th Hummels:
Germans liek meses. I'm sik of th siet of this; and thaer's no
reezon U should all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool," cried
Amy, wieping her ies.</p>

<p>"I thaut I <em>should</em> hav died when I saw U too gurls ratling
about in th whut-U-call-it, liek too litl curnels in a verry big nutshel,
and muther waeting in staet to reseev th throng," sighed Jo,
qiet spent with lafter.</p>

<p>"I'm verry sorry U wer disapointed, deer, but we all did our
best to satisfi U," sed Mrs. March, in a toen fuul of mutherly regret.</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> satisfied; I've dun whut I undertuuk, and it's not mi fault
that it faeld; I cumfort mieself with that," sed Amy, with a litl qiver
in her vois. "I thank U all verry much for helping me, and I'll
thank U still mor if U wun't alood to it for a munth, at leest."</p>

<p>No wun did for several munths; but th wurd "<i>fête</i>" aulwaes produced
a jeneral smiel, and Laurie's burthdae gift to Amy wuz a tieny
coral lobster in th shaep of a charm for her woch-gard.</p>

<p class="h2a">Literaery Lesons.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Forchun</span> sudenly smield upon Jo, and dropt a guud-luk peny
in her path. Not a goelden peny, exaktly, but I dout if haf a milyon
wuud hav given mor reeal hapynes than did th litl sum that caem
to her in this wiez.</p>

<p>Every fue weeks she wuud shut herself up in her room, put on her
scribling suit, and "faul into a vortex," as she exprest it, rieting
away at her novel with all her hart and soel, for till that wuz finisht
she cuud fiend no peess. Her "scribling suit" consisted of a blak
woollen pinafore on which she cuud wiep her pen at wil, and a cap
<span class="pagenum2">326</span>
of th saem mateerial, adornd with a cheerful red boe, into which she
bundled her haer when th deks wer cleerd for akshon. This cap
wuz a beecon to th inqiering ies of her family, hoo duuring thees
periods kept thaer distanss, meerly poping in thaer heds semy-ocaezhonaly,
to ask, with interest, "Duz jeenyus burn, Jo?" Thae did
not aulwaes venture eeven to ask this qeschon, but tuuk an obzervaeshon
of th cap, and jujd acordingly. If this expresiv artikl of dres
wuz drawn loe upon th forhed, it wuz a sien that hard wurk wuz
going on; in exsieting moements it wuz pushed raekishly askew; and
when despaer seezd th author it wuz plukt hoely off, and cast
upon th flor. At such times th introoder silently withdroo; and
not until th red boe wuz seen gaely erekt upon th gifted brow, did
any wun daer adres Jo.</p>

<p>She did not think herself a jeenyus by any means; but when th
rieting fit caem on, she gaev herself up to it with entier abandon, and
led a blissful lief, unconshus of wont, caer, or bad wether, whiel she
sat saef and hapy in an imajinarry wurld, fuul of frends aulmoest as reeal
and deer to her as any in th flesh. Sleep forsuuk her ies, meels
stuud untasted, dae and niet wer all too short to enjoy th hapynes
which blest her oenly at such times, and maed thees ours wurth
living, eeven if thae bor no uther froot. Th divine afflatus uezhualy
lasted a week or too, and then she emerged from her "vortex,"
hunggry, sleepy, cros, or despondent.</p>

<p>She wuz just recuvering from wun of thees attacks when she wuz
prevaeld upon to escort Mis Crocker to a lecture, and in return for
her vurchoo wuz reworded with a nue iedeea. It wuz a Peepl's Corss,
th lecture on th Pyramids, and Jo rather wunderd at th chois of
such a subjekt for such an audi’enss, but tuuk it for granted that sum
graet soeshal eevil wuud be remedied or sum graet wont suplied by
unfoelding th glorys of th Pharaohs to an audi’enss hoos thoughts
wer busy with th priess of coel and flour, and hoos lievs wer
spent in trieing to solv harder ridls than that of th Sfinx.</p>

<p>Thae wer eerly; and whiel Mis Crocker set th heel of her stoking,
Jo amuezd herself by examining th faeses of th peepl hoo
ocuepied th seet with them. On her left wer too maetrons, with
masiv forheds, and bonnets to mach, discusing Wuuman's Riets
<span class="pagenum2">327</span>
and maeking tating. Beyond sat a paer of humbl luvers, artlesly
hoelding eech uther by th hand, a sombre spinster eating pepermints
out of a paeper bag, and an oeld jentlman taeking his preparatory nap
behind a yelo bandanna. On her riet, her oenly naebor wuz a
stoodius-luuking lad absorbd in a nuezpaeper.</p>

<p>It wuz a piktorial sheet, and Jo examind th wurk of art neerest
her, iedly wundering whut unfortuitous concatenation of surcumstanses
needed th melodramatik ilustraeshon of an Indian in fuul wor costume,
tumbling oever a precipice with a wuulf at his throet, whiel too
infueriaeted yung jentlmen, with unnacheraly small feet and big ies,
wer stabing eech uther cloez by, and a dishevelled feemael wuz flieing
away in th bakground with her mouth wied oepen. Pausing to turn
a paej, th lad saw her luuking, and, with boyish guud-naechuur, oferd
haf his paeper, saeing bluntly, "Wont to red it? That's a furst-raet
story."</p>

<p>Jo accepted it with a smiel, for she had never outgroen her lieking
for lads, and soon found herself involvd in th uezhual laberinth of luv,
mistery, and murder, for th story belongd to that clas of liet literachuur
in which th pashons hav a holidae, and when th author's
invenshon faels, a grand catastrofy cleers th staej of wun haf th
<i>dramatis pursonæ</i>, leeving th uther haf to exult oever thaer dounfaul.</p>

<p>"Priem, isn't it?" askt th boy, as her ie went doun th last
parragraf of her porshon.</p>

<p>"I think U and I cuud do as wel as that if we tried," returnd
Jo, amuezd at his admeraeshon of th trash.</p>

<p>"I should think I wuz a prity luky chap if I cuud. She maeks
a guud living out of such storys, thae sae;" and he pointed to th
naem of Mrs. S. L. A. N. G. Northbury, under th tietl of th tael.</p>

<p>"Do U noe her?" askt Jo, with suden interest.</p>

<p>"No; but I red all her pieces, and I noe a felo hoo wurks in
th ofis whaer this paeper is printing."</p>

<p>"Do U sae she maeks a guud living out of storys liek this?" and
Jo luukt mor respektfuly at th ajitaeted groop and thikly-sprinkld
exclamation-points that adornd th paej.</p>

<p>"Ges she duz! She noes just whut foeks liek, and gets paed
wel for rieting it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">328</span>
Heer th lecture began, but Jo hurd verry litl of it, for whiel
Prof. Sands wuz prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and
hieroglifiks, she wuz covertly taeking doun th adres of th paeper,
and boeldly rezolving to tri for th hundred-dolar priez oferd in
its columns for a sensaeshonal story. By th tiem th lecture ended and
th audi’enss awoke, she had bilt up a splendid forchun for herself
(not th furst founded upon paeper), and wuz aulredy deep in th concoction
of her story, being unaebl to desied whether th dueel should
cum befor th eloepment or after th murder.</p>

<p>She sed nuthing of her plan at hoem, but fel to wurk next dae,
much to th disquiet of her muther, hoo aulwaes luukt a litl anxious
when "jeenyus tuuk to burning." Jo had never tried this stiel befor,
contenting herself with verry mield roemanses for th "Spred Eegl."
Her theatrikal expeeri’enss and miselaenius reeding wer of survis
now, for thae gaev her sum iedeea of dramatik efekt, and suplied plot,
langgwej, and costumes. Her story wuz as fuul of desperaeshon and
despaer as her limited aqaentanss with thoes uncumfortabl emotions
enaebld her to maek it, and, having loecaeted it in Lisbon, she woond
up with an urthqaek, as a strieking and aproepriat <i>dénouement</i>. Th
manuescript wuz privately despacht, accompanied by a noet, modestly
saeing that if th tael didn't get th priez, which th rieter
hardly dared expect, she wuud be verry glad to reseev any sum it
miet be considerd wurth.</p>

</div>

<p>Six weeks is a long tiem to waet, and a still longer tiem for a gurl to
keep a seecret; but Jo did boeth, and wuz just begining to giv up all
hoep of ever seeing her manuescript again, when a leter arrived which
aulmoest tuuk her breth away; for on oepening it, a chek for a hundred
dolars fel into her lap. For a mienuet she staerd at it as if it had
been a snaek, then she red her leter and began to cri. If th
aemiabl jentlman hoo roet that kiendly noet cuud hav noen whut
intenss hapynes he wuz giving a felo-creecher, I think he wuud
devoet his leezher ours, if he has any, to that amuezment; for Jo
valued th leter mor than th muny, because it wuz encurejing;
and after yeers of efort it wuz <em>so</em> plezant to fiend that she had lurnd
to do sumthing, tho it wuz oenly to riet a sensaeshon story.</p>

<p>A prouder yung wuuman wuz seldom seen than she, when, having
<span class="pagenum2">329</span>
compoezd herself, she electrified th family by apeering befor them
with th leter in wun hand, th chek in th uther, anounsing that
she had wun th priez. Of corss thaer wuz a graet jubilee, and
when th story caem every wun red and praezd it; tho after her
faather had toeld her that
th langgwej wuz guud,
th roemanss fresh and
harty, and th trajedy
qiet thriling, he shuuk
his hed, and sed in
his unwurldly wae,—</p>

<p>"U can do beter
than this, Jo. Aem at
th hieest, and never
miend th muny."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> think th muny
is th best part of it.
Whut <em>wil</em> U do with
such a forchun?" askt
Amy, regarding th
majik slip of paeper with
a reverenshal ie.</p>

<p>"Send Beth and
muther to th seesied for a munth or too," anserd Jo promptly.</p>

<p>"O, how splendid! No, I can't do it, deer, it wuud be so selfish,"
cried Beth, hoo had clapt her thin hands, and taeken a long
breth, as if piening for fresh oeshan-breezes; then stopt herself, and
moeshond away th chek which her sister waevd befor her.</p>

<p>"Ah, but U shal go, I've set mi hart on it; that's whut I tried
for, and that's whi I succeeded. I never get on when I think of
mieself aloen, so it wil help me to wurk for U, don't U see?
Besieds, Marmee needs th chaenj, and she wun't leev U, so U
<em>must</em> go. Wun't it be fun to see U cum hoem plump and roezy
again? Hooraa for Dr. Jo, hoo aulwaes cuers her paeshents!"</p>

<p>To th see sied thae went, after much discushon; and tho Beth
didn't cum hoem as plump and roezy as cuud be dezierd, she wuz
<span class="pagenum2">330</span>
much beter, whiel Mrs. March declaerd she felt ten yeers yungger;
so Jo wuz satisfied with th investment of her priez muny, and fel to
wurk with a cheery spirit, bent on urning mor of thoes delietful
cheks. She did urn several that yeer, and began to feel herself a
power in th hous; for by th majik of a pen, her "rubish" turnd
into cumforts for them all. "Th Duek's Dauter" paed th butcher's
bil, "A Fantom Hand" put doun a nue carpet, and th "Curss
of th Coventrys" proovd th blesing of th Marches in th wae of
groeserys and gouns.</p>

<p>Welth is surtenly a moest dezierabl thing, but poverty has its suny
sied, and wun of th sweet uezes of advursity is th jenuein satisfakshon
which cums from harty wurk of hed or hand; and to th inspiraeshon
of nesesity, we oe haf th wiez, buetiful, and uesful blessings
of th wurld. Jo enjoyd a taest of this satisfakshon, and seest
to envy richer gurls, taeking graet cumfort in th nolej that she
cuud suplie her oen wonts, and need ask no wun for a peny.</p>

<p>Litl noetis wuz taeken of her storys, but thae found a market; and,
encurejd by this fakt, she rezolvd to maek a boeld stroek for faem and
forchun. Having copyd her novel for th foerth tiem, red it to all her
confidenshal frends, and submitted it with feer and trembling to three
publishers, she at last dispoezd of it, on condishon that she wuud cut
it doun wun thurd, and oemit all th parts which she particularly admierd.</p>

<p>"Now I must eether bundle it bak into mi tin-kichen to mould,
pae for printing it mieself, or chop it up to suit purchasers, and get
whut I can for it. Faem is a verry guud thing to hav in th hous, but
cash is mor convenient; so I wish to taek th senss of th meeting
on this important subjekt," sed Jo, calling a family council.</p>

<p>"Don't spoil yuur book, mi gurl, for thaer is mor in it than U
noe, and th iedeea is wel wurkt out. Let it waet and riepen," wuz
her faather's advice; and he practised as he preecht, having waeted
paeshently thurty yeers for froot of his oen to riepen, and being in no
haest to gather it, eeven now, when it wuz sweet and melo.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that Jo wil profit mor by maeking th trieal than
by waeting," sed Mrs. March. "Critisizm is th best test of such
wurk, for it wil sho her boeth unsuspekted merits and faults, and help
her to do beter next tiem. We ar too partial; but th praez and
<span class="pagenum2">331</span>
blaem of outsieders wil proov uesful, eeven if she gets but litl
muny."</p>

<p>"Yes," sed Jo, niting her brows, "that's just it; I've been
fusing oever th thing so long, I reealy don't noe whether it's guud,
bad, or indiferent. It wil be a graet help to hav cool, imparshal
pursons taek a luuk at it, and tel me whut thae think of it."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't leev out a wurd of it; U'll spoil it if U do, for
th interest of th story is mor in th miends than in th akshons of th
peepl, and it wil be all a mudl if U don't explaen as U go on,"
sed Meg, hoo furmly beleevd that this book wuz th moest remarkabl
novel ever riten.</p>

<p>"But Mr. Allen sez, 'Leev out th explanaeshons, maek it brief and
dramatik, and let th carrakters tel th story,'" interupted Jo, turning
to th publisher's noet.</p>

<p>"Do as he tels U; he noes whut wil sel, and we don't. Maek
a guud, popuelar book, and get as much muny as U can. By and
by, when, U've got a naem, U can afford to diegres, and hav
philosophical and metafizikal peepl in yuur novels," sed Amy, hoo
tuuk a striktly praktikal vue of th subjekt.</p>

<p>"Wel," sed Jo, lafing, "if mi peepl <em>ar</em> 'philosophical and
metafizikal,' it isn't mi fault, for I noe nuthing about such things,
exsept whut I heer faather sae, sumtiems. If I've got sum of his
wiez iedeeas jumbld up with mi roemanss, so much th beter for me.
Now, Beth, whut do U sae?"</p>

<p>"I should so liek to see it printing <em>soon</em>," wuz all Beth sed, and
smield in saeing it; but thaer wuz an unconshus emfasis on th last
wurd, and a wistful luuk in th ies that never lost thaer chieldliek
candor, which child Jo's hart, for a mienuet, with a forboeding feer,
and desieded her to maek her litl venture "soon."</p>

<p>So, with Spartan furmnes, th yung authoress laed her furst-born on
her taebl, and chopt it up as roothlesly as any oeger. In th hoep
of pleezing every wun, she tuuk every wun's advice; and, liek th oeld
man and his donky in th faebl, suited noebody.</p>

<p>Her faather liked th metafizikal streek which had unconshusly
got into it; so that wuz alowd to remaen, tho she had her doubts
about it. Her muther thaut that thaer <em>wuz</em> a trifle too much
<span class="pagenum2">332</span>
descripshon; out, thaerfor, it neerly all caem, and with it meny nesesaery
links in th story. Meg admierd th trajedy; so Jo pield up
th agony to suit her, whiel Amy objekted to th fun, and, with th
best intenshons in lief, Jo qencht th sprietly seens which releevd
th sombre carrakter of th story. Then, to complete th rooin, she
cut it doun wun thurd, and confidingly sent th puur litl roemanss,
liek a pikt robin, out into th big, busy wurld, to tri its faet.</p>

<p>Wel, it wuz printing, and she got three hundred dolars for it; liekwiez
plenty of praez and blaem, boeth so much graeter than she
expected that she wuz throen into a staet of bewilderment, from
which it tuuk her sum tiem to recuver.</p>

<p>"U sed, muther, that critisizm wuud help me; but how can it,
when it's so contradictory that I don't noe whether I've riten a
promising book or broeken all th ten commandments?" cried puur Jo,
turning oever a heep of noetises, th perusal of which fild her with
pride and joy wun mienuet, rath and dier dismae th next. "This
man sez 'An exqizit book, fuul of trooth, buety, and urnestly;
all is sweet, puer, and helthy,'" continued th perplexed authoress.
"Th next, 'Th theeory of th book is bad, fuul of morbid fansys,
spiritualistic iedeeas, and unnacheral carrakters.' Now, as I had no
theeory of any kiend, don't beleev in Spirichualizm, and copyd mi
carrakters from lief, I don't see how this critik <em>can</em> be riet. Anuther
sez, 'It's wun of th best American novels which has apeerd for
yeers' (I noe beter than that); and th next asserts that 'tho
it is orijinal, and riten with graet forss and feeling, it is a daenjerus
book.' 'Tisn't! Sum maek fun of it, sum oever-praez, and neerly
all insist that I had a deep theeory to expound, when I oenly roet it
for th plezher and th muny. I wish I'd printing it hoel or not
at all, for I do haet to be so misjujd."</p>

<p>Her family and frends administerd cumfort and comendaeshon
liberaly; yet it wuz a hard tiem for sensitive, hie-spirited Jo, hoo
ment so wel, and had apparently dun so il. But it did her guud,
for thoes hoos opinyon had reeal value gaev her th critisizm which is
an author's best ejucaeshon; and when th furst sornes wuz oever, she
cuud laf at her puur litl book, yet beleev in it still, and feel herself
th wiezer and strongger for th buffeting she had reseevd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">333</span>
"Not being a jeenyus, liek Keats, it wun't kil me," she sed stoutly;
"and I've got th joek on mi sied, after all; for th parts that wer
taeken straet out of reeal lief ar denounst as imposibl and
absurd, and th seens that I maed up out of mi oen sily hed ar
pronounced 'charmingly nacheral, tender, and troo.' So I'll cumfort
mieself with that; and when I'm redy, I'll up again and taek
anuther."</p>

<p class="h2a">Domestik Expeeri’enses.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Liek</span> moest uther yung maetrons, Meg began her marryd lief with
th deturminaeshon to be a model houskeeper. John should fiend
hoem a paradise; he should aulwaes see a smieling faess, should faer
sumptuously every dae, and never noe th lost of a buton. She
brought so much luv, enerjy, and cheerfulnes to th wurk that she
cuud not but succeed, in spiet of sum obstakls. Her paradise wuz
not a tranquil wun; for th litl wuuman fust, wuz oever-anxious to
pleez, and busld about liek a troo Martha, cumbered with meny
caers. She wuz too tierd, sumtiems, eeven to smiel; John groo dispeptik
after a corss of dainty dishes, and ungraetfuly demanded
plaen faer. As for butons, she soon lurnd to wunder whaer thae
went, to shaek her hed oever th carelessness of men, and to threten
to maek him soe them on himself, and then see if <em>his</em> wurk wuud
stand impaeshent tugs and clumzy finggers any beter than hers.</p>

<p>Thae wer verry hapy, eeven after thae discuverd that thae couldn't
liv on luv aloen. John did not fiend Meg's buety diminisht, tho
she beemd at him from behind th familyar cofy-pot; nor did Meg
<span class="pagenum2">335</span>
mis any of th roemanss from th daily parting, when her huzband
foloed up his kis with th tender inqiery, "Shal I send hoem veel
or muton for diner, darling?" Th litl hous seest to be a glorified
bower, but it becaem a hoem, and th yung cupl soon felt
that it wuz a chaenj for th beter. At furst thae plaed keep-hous,
and frolikt oever it liek children; then John tuuk steadily to business,
feeling th caers of th hed of a family upon his shoulders;
and Meg laed by her cambric rapers, put on a big apron, and fel to
wurk, as befor sed, with mor enerjy than discreshon.</p>

<p>Whiel th cuuking maenia lasted she went thru Mrs. Cornelius's
Reseet Book as if it wer a mathematikal exercise, wurking out th
problems with paeshenss and caer. Sumtiems her family wer invieted
in to help eat up a too bounteous feest of successes, or Lotty wuud
be privately despacht with a bach of faeluers, which wer to be
concealed from all ies in th convenient stumaks of th litl
Hummels. An evening with John oever th account-books uezhualy
produced a temporaery lul in th cuelinarry enthusiasm, and a froogal fit
wuud ensue, duuring which th puur man wuz put thru a corss of
bred-puuding, hash, and wormd-oever cofy, which tried his soel,
aultho he bor it with praiseworthy fortitued. Befor th goelden
meen wuz found, however, Meg aded to her domestik possessions
whut yung cupls seldom get on long without,—a family jar.</p>

<p>Fierd with a housewifely wish to see her stor-room stocked with
hoem-maed prezurvs, she undertuuk to put up her oen curant jely.
John wuz reqested to order hoem a duzen or so of litl pots, and an
extra qontity of sugar, for thaer oen curants wer riep, and wer to
be atended to at wunss. As John furmly beleevd that "mi wief" wuz
equal to anything, and tuuk a nacheral pride in her skil, he rezolvd
that she should be gratified, and thaer oenly crop of froot laed by in a
moest pleezing form for winter uez. Hoem caem foer duzen delietful
litl pots, haf a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pik th
curants for her. With her prity haer tukt into a litl cap, arms
bared to th elbo, and a chekt apron which had a coquettish luuk
in spiet of th bib, th yung houswief fel to wurk, feeling no doubts
about her success; for hadn't she seen Hannah do it hundreds of
times? Th arae of pots rather amaezd her at furst, but John wuz so
<span class="pagenum2">336</span>
fond of jely, and th niess litl jars wuud luuk so wel on th top
shelf, that Meg rezolvd to fil them all, and spent a long dae piking,
boiling, straening, and fusing oever her jely. She did her best; she
askt advice of Mrs. Cornelius; she rakt her braen to remember
whut Hannah did that she had left undun; she reboiled, resugared,
and restraend, but that dredful stuf wouldn't "<em>jel</em>."</p>

<p>She longed to run hoem, bib and all, and ask muther to lend a hand,
but John and she had agreed that thae wuud never anoy any wun
with thaer private wurys, experriments, or qorrels. Thae had laft
oever that last wurd as if th iedeea it sugjested wuz a moest preposterous
wun; but thae had held to thaer rezolv, and whenever thae cuud get
on without help thae did so, and no wun interfeerd, for Mrs. March
had advised th plan. So Meg resld aloen with th refraktory
sweetmeats all that hot sumer dae, and at fiev o'clok sat doun
in her topsy-turvy kichen, wrung her bedaubed hands, lifted up her
vois and wept.</p>

<p>Now, in th furst flush of th nue lief, she had ofen sed,—</p>

<p>"Mi huzband shal aulwaes feel free to bring a frend hoem whenever
he lieks. I shal aulwaes be prepaerd; thaer shal be no flury, no
scoelding, no discumfort, but a neet hous, a cheerful wief, and a guud
diner. John, deer, never stop to ask mi leev, inviet hoom U
pleez, and be shuur of a welcum from me."</p>

<p>How charming that wuz, to be shuur! John qiet gloed with pride
to heer her sae it, and felt whut a blest thing it wuz to hav a superior
wief. But, aultho thae had had company from tiem to tiem, it
never happened to be unexpekted, and Meg had never had an oportuenity
to distingwish herself till now. It aulwaes happens so in this vael
of teers; thaer is an inevitability about such things which we can oenly
wunder at, deplor, and baer as we best can.</p>

<p>If John had not forgoten all about th jely, it reealy wuud hav
been unpardonable in him to chooz that dae, of all th daes in
th yeer, to bring a frend hoem to diner unexpectedly. Congrachulaeting
himself that a handsum repast had been orderd that morning,
feeling shuur that it wuud be redy to th mienuet, and induljing in
plezant antisipaeshons of th charming efekt it wuud produce, when
his prity wief caem runing out to meet him, he escorted his frend
<span class="pagenum2">337</span>
to his manshon, with th irepresibl satisfakshon of a yung hoest and
huzband.</p>

<p>It is a wurld of disappointments, as John discuverd when he
reached th Duv-cote. Th frunt dor uezhualy stuud hospitably
oepen; now it wuz not oenly shut, but locked, and yesterdae's mud still
adornd th steps. Th parlor-windoes wer cloezd and curtend,
no pikcher of th prity wief soeing on th piazza, in whiet, with a distracting
litl boe in her haer, or a briet-ied hoestes, smieling a shi
welcum as she greeted her guessed. Nuthing of th sort, for not a soel
apeerd, but a sanggwinaery-luuking boy asleep under th curant-bushes.</p>

<p>"I'm afraed sumthing has happened. Step into th garden, Scott,
whiel I luuk up Mrs. Brooke," sed John, alarmd at th silence and
solitued.</p>

<p>Round th hous he huryd, led by a pungent smel of burnt sugar,
and Mr. Scott stroeld after him, with a qeer luuk on his faess. He
paused discreetly at a distanss when Brooke disapeerd; but he
cuud boeth see and heer, and, being a bachelors, enjoyd th prospekt
mietily.</p>

<p>In th kichen raend confuezhon and despaer; wun edishon of jely
wuz trikld from pot to pot, anuther lae upon th flor, and a thurd
wuz burning gaely on th stoev. Lotty, with Teutonic flem, wuz
calmly eating bred and curant wien, for th jely wuz still in a hoeplesly
liqid staet, whiel Mrs. Brooke, with her apron oever her hed,
sat sobing dizmaly.</p>

<p>"Mi deerest gurl, whut is th mater?" cried John, rushing in, with
auful vizhons of scaulded hands, suden nues of aflikshon, and seecret
consternaeshon at th thaut of th guessed in th garden.</p>

<p>"O John, I <em>am</em> so tierd and hot and cros and wuryd! I've
been at it till I'm all worn out. Do cum and help me or I <em>shal</em>
die!" and th exausted houswief cast herself upon his breast, giving
him a sweet welcum in every senss of th wurd, for her pinafore
had been baptiezd at th saem tiem as th flor.</p>

<p>"Whut wurys U, deer? Has anything dredful happened?"
askt th anxious John, tenderly kissing th croun of th litl cap,
which wuz all askew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">338</span>
"Yes," sobd Meg despaeringly.</p>

<p>"Tel me qik, then. Don't cri, I can baer anything beter than
that. Out with it, luv."</p>

<p>"Th—th jely wun't jel and I don't noe whut to do!"</p>

<p>John Brooke laft then as he never dared to laf afterward; and
th derizhons Scott smield involuntarrily as he hurd th harty peel,
which put th finishing stroek to puur Meg's wo.</p>

<p>"Is that all? Fling it out of windo, and don't bother any mor
about it. I'll bie U qorts if U wont it; but for heven's saek
don't hav histerriks, for I've brought Jak Scott hoem to diner,
and—"</p>

<p>John got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands
with a trajik jescher as she fel into a chaer, exclaeming in a toen of
minggld indignaeshon, reproech, and dismae,—</p>

<p>"A man to diner, and everything in a mes! John Brooke, how
<em>cuud</em> U do such a thing?"</p>

<p>"Hush, he's in th garden! I forgot th confounded jely, but it
can't be helpt now," sed John, survaeing th prospekt with an
anxious ie.</p>

<p>"U aut to hav sent wurd, or toeld me this morning, and U
aut to hav rememberd how busy I wuz," continued Meg petulantly;
for eeven turtle-duvs wil peck when rufld.</p>

<p>"I didn't noe it this morning, and thaer wuz no tiem to send
wurd, for I met him on th wae out. I never thaut of asking
leev, when U hav aulwaes toeld me to do as I liked. I never tried
it befor, and hang me if I ever do again!" aded John, with an
aggrieved aer.</p>

<p>"I should hoep not! Taek him away at wunss; I can't see him,
and thaer isn't any diner."</p>

<p>"Wel, I liek that! Whaer's th beef and vejetabls I sent hoem,
and th puuding U promist?" cried John, rushing to th larder.</p>

<p>"I hadn't tiem to cuuk anything; I ment to dien at muther's.
I'm sorry, but I wuz <em>so</em> busy;" and Meg's teers began again.</p>

<p>John wuz a mield man, but he wuz hueman; and after a long dae's
wurk, to cum hoem tierd, hunggry, and hoepful, to fiend a caeotik
hous, an empty taebl, and a cros wief wuz not exaktly conducive to
<span class="pagenum2">339</span>
repoez of miend or maner. He restraend himself, however, and th
litl squall wuud hav bloen oever, but for wun unluky wurd.</p>

<p>"It's a scraep, I aknolej; but if U wil lend a hand, we'll
puul thru, and hav a guud tiem yet. Don't cri, deer, but just
exert yuurself a bit, and nok us up sumthing to eat. We're boeth
as hunggry as hunters, so we sha'n't miend whut it is. Giv us th coeld
meet, and bred and cheez; we wun't ask for jely."</p>

<p>He ment it for a guud-naecherd joek; but that wun wurd seeld his
faet. Meg thaut it wuz <em>too</em> crooel to hint about her sad faeluer, and
th last atom of paeshenss vanisht as he spoek.</p>

<p>"U must get yuurself out of th scraep as U can; I'm too
uezd up to 'exert' mieself for any wun. It's liek a man to propoez a
boen and vulgar bred and cheez for company. I wun't hav anything
of th sort in mi hous. Taek that Scott up to muther's, and
tel him I'm away, sik, ded,—anything. I wun't see him, and U
too can laf at me and mi jely as much as U liek: U wun't
hav anything else heer;" and having deliverd her defieanss all in wun
breth, Meg cast away her pinafore, and precipitately left th feeld to
bemoan herself in her oen room.</p>

<p>Whut thoes too creechers did in her absence, she never knew; but
Mr. Scott wuz not taeken "up to muther's," and when Meg desended,
after thae had stroeld away together, she found traeses of a promiscuous
lunch which fild her with horror. Lotty reported that thae had
eeten "a much, and graetly laft, and th master bid her thro
away all th sweet stuf, and hied th pots."</p>

<p>Meg longed to go and tel muther; but a senss of shaem at her
<ins title="Change shortcomings to short-comings."> 
oen short-comings,</ins> of loyalty to John, "hoo miet be crooel, but 
noebody should noe it," restraend her; and after a summary cleering
up, she drest herself pritily, and sat doun to waet for John to cum
and be forgiven.</p>

<p>Unforchunatly, John didn't cum, not seeing th mater in that
liet. He had carried it off as a guud joek with Scott, excuezd his
litl wief as wel as he cuud, and plaed th hoest so hospitably that
his frend enjoyd th impromptoo diner, and promist to cum
again. But John wuz anggry, tho he did not sho it; he felt that
Meg had got him into a scraep, and then dezurted him in his our of
<span class="pagenum2">340</span>
need. "It wasn't faer to tel a man to bring foeks hoem any tiem,
with perfect freedom, and when he tuuk U at yuur wurd, to flaem
up and blaem him, and leev him in th lurch, to be laft at or
pityd. No, by George, it wasn't! and Meg must noe it." He
had fumed inwardly duuring th feest, but when th flury wuz oever,
and he stroeld hoem, after seeing Scott off, a mielder mood caem oever
him. "Puur litl thing! it wuz hard upon her when she tried so
hartily to pleez me. She wuz rong, of corss, but then she wuz
yung. I must be paeshent and teech her." He hoept she had not
gon hoem—he haeted gosip and interfeerenss. For a mienuet he
wuz rufld again at th meer thaut of it; and then th feer that
Meg wuud cri herself sik sofend his hart, and sent him on at a
qiker paess, rezolving to be calm and kiend, but furm, qiet furm, and
sho her whaer she had faeld in her duty to her spouse.</p>

<p>Meg liekwiez rezolvd to be "calm and kiend, but furm," and sho
<em>him</em> his duty. She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and
be kist and cumforted, as she wuz shuur of being; but, of corss,
she did nuthing of th sort, and when she saw John cuming, began
to hum qiet nacheraly, as she rokt and soed, liek a laedy of leezher
in her best parlor.</p>

<p>John wuz a litl disapointed not to fiend a tender Niobe; but,
feeling that his dignity demanded th furst apolojy, he maed nun,
oenly caem leezherly in, and laed himself upon th soefa, with th singularly
relevant remark,—</p>

<p>"We ar going to hav a nue moon, mi deer."</p>

<p>"I've no objekshon," wuz Meg's equally soothing remark.</p>

<p>A fue uther topiks of jeneral interest wer introduest by Mr.
Brooke, and wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation langgwisht.
John went to wun windo, unfoelded his paeper, and rapt
himself in it, figerativly speeking. Meg went to th uther windo,
and soed as if nue roezets for her slipers wer amung th nesesaerys
of lief. Neether spoek; boeth luukt qiet "calm and furm,"
and boeth felt desperatly uncumfortabl.</p>

<p>"O deer," thaut Meg, "marryd lief is verry trieing, and duz
need infinit paeshenss, as wel as luv, as muther sez." Th wurd
"muther" sugjested uther maturnal counsels, given long ago, and
reseevd with unbeleeving proetests.</p>

"John is a guud man, but he has his faults, and U must lurn to
see and baer with them, remembering yuur oen. He is verry desieded,
but never wil be obstinet, if U reezon kiendly, not opoez impaeshently.
He is verry accurate, and particular about th trooth—a guud
traet, tho U call him 'fusy.' Never deseev him by luuk or
wurd, Meg, and he wil giv U th confidenss U dezurv, th suport
U need. He has a temper, not liek ours,—wun flash, and then
all oever,—but th whiet, still angger, that is seldom sturd, but wunss
kindld, is hard to qench. Be careful, verry careful, not to waek
this angger against yuurself, for peess and hapynes depend on keeping
his respekt. Woch yuurself, be th furst to ask pardon if U
boeth err, and gard against th litl piques, misunderstandings, and
hasty wurds that ofen pave th wae for biter sorro and regret."</p>

<p>Thees wurds caem bak to Meg, as she sat soeing in th sunset,
especially th last. This wuz th furst seerius disagreement; her oen
hasty speeches sounded boeth sily and unkiend, as she recauld them,
her oen angger luukt chieldish now, and thoughts of puur John cuming
<span class="pagenum2">342</span>
hoem to such a seen qiet melted her hart. She glanst at
him with teers in her ies, but he did not see them; she put doun
her wurk and got up, thinking, "I <em>wil</em> be th furst to sae, 'Forgiv
me,'" but he did not seem to heer her; she went verry sloely acros
th room, for pride wuz hard to swallow, and stuud by him, but he
did not turn his hed. For a mienuet she felt as if she reealy couldn't
do it; then caem th thaut, "This is th begining, I'll do mi
part, and hav nuthing to reproech mieself with," and stooping doun,
she softly kist her huzband on th forhed. Of corss that setld
it; th penitent kis wuz beter than a wurld of wurds, and John
had her on his nee in a mienuet, saeing tenderly,—</p>

<p>"It wuz too bad to laf at th puur litl jely-pots. Forgiv me,
deer, I never wil again!"</p>

<p>But he did, o bles U, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg,
boeth declaering that it wuz th sweetest jely thae ever maed; for family
peess wuz prezurvd in that litl family jar.</p>

<p>After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to diner by speshal invitaeshon, and
survd him up a plezant feest without a cuukt wief for th furst
corss; on which ocaezhon she wuz so gae and graeshus, and maed
everything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott toeld John he wuz a
hapy felo, and shuuk his hed oever th hardships of bachelorhood
all th wae hoem.</p>

<p>In th autumn, nue trieals and expeeri’enses caem to Meg. Sallie
Moffat renued her frendship, wuz aulwaes runing out for a dish of
gosip at th litl hous, or invieting "that puur deer" to cum in
and spend th dae at th big hous. It wuz plezant, for in dul
wether Meg ofen felt loenly; all wer busy at hoem, John absent
till niet, and nuthing to do but soe, or red, or potter about. So it
nacheraly fel out that Meg got into th wae of gading and gosiping
with her frend. Seeing Sallie's prity things maed her long for such,
and pity herself because she had not got them. Sallie wuz verry kiend,
and ofen oferd her th cuveted trifles; but Meg decliend them,
noeing that John wouldn't liek it; and then this foolish litl wuuman
went and did whut John disliekt infinitly wurss.</p>

<p>She knew her huzband's incum, and she luvd to feel that he
trusted her, not oenly with his hapynes, but whut sum men seem to
<span class="pagenum2">343</span>
value mor,—his muny. She knew whaer it wuz, wuz free to taek
whut she liked, and all he askt wuz that she should keep account of
every peny, pae bils wunss a munth, and remember that she wuz a
puur man's wief. Till now, she had dun wel, been proodent and exakt,
kept her litl account-books neetly, and shoed them to him
munthly without feer. But that autumn th surpent got into Meg's
paradise, and tempted her, liek meny a modern Eve, not with apples,
but with dres. Meg didn't liek to be pityd and maed to feel puur;
it iritaeted her, but she wuz ashamed to confes it, and now and then
she tried to consoel herself by buying sumthing prity, so that Sallie
needn't think she had to economiez. She aulwaes felt wiked after it,
for th prity things wer seldom nesesaerys; but then thae cost so
litl, it wasn't wurth wurying about; so th trifles increest unconshusly,
and in th shoping excursions she wuz no longer a passive
luuker-on.</p>

<p>But th trifles cost mor than wun wuud imajin; and when she
cast up her accounts at th end of th munth, th sum toetal rather
scaerd her. John wuz busy that munth, and left th bils to her; th
next munth he wuz absent; but th thurd he had a grand qorterly
setling up, and Meg never forgot it. A fue daes befor she had
dun a dredful thing, and it waed upon her conshenss. Sallie
had been buying silks, and Meg longed for a nue wun,—just a handsum
liet wun for partys, her blak silk wuz so common, and thin
things for evening waer wer oenly proper for gurls. Ant March uezhualy
gaev th sisters a prezent of twenty-fiev dolars apeess at Nue
Yeer; that wuz oenly a munth to waet, and heer wuz a luvly vieolet silk
going at a bargan, and she had th muny, if she oenly dared to taek
it. John aulwaes sed whut wuz his wuz hers; but wuud he think it
riet to spend not oenly th prospektiv fiev-and-twenty, but anuther
fiev-and-twenty out of th hous-hoeld fund? That wuz th qeschon.
Sallie had urjd her to do it, had oferd to loen th muny, and
with th best intenshons in lief, had tempted Meg beyond her strength.
In an eevil moement th shopman held up th luvly, shimering foelds,
and sed, "A bargan, I ashuur U, maa'am." She anserd, "I'll taek
it;" and it wuz cut off and paed for, and Sallie had exulted, and she
had laft as if it wer a thing of no consequence, and driven away,
<span class="pagenum2">344</span>
feeling as if she had stoelen sumthing, and th poleess wer after
her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 560px;">

</div>

<p>When she got hoem, she tried to assuage th pangs of remorss by
spreding forth th luvly silk; but it luukt les silvery now, didn't
becum her, after all, and th wurds "fifty dolars" seemd stampt
liek a patern doun eech bredth. She put it away; but it haunted
her, not delietfuly, as a nue dres should, but dredfuly, liek th
goest of a foly that wuz not eezily laed. When John got out his books
that niet, Meg's hart sank, and for th furst tiem in her marryd lief,
she wuz afraed of her huzband. Th kiend, broun ies luukt as if
thae cuud be sturn; and tho he wuz unuezhualy merry, she fansyd
he had found her out, but didn't meen to let her noe it. Th
hous-bils wer all paed, th books all in order. John had praezd
her, and wuz undoing th oeld poket-book which thae called th
"bank," when Meg, noeing that it wuz qiet empty, stopt his
hand, saeing nurvusly,—</p>

<p>"U haeven't seen mi private expense book yet."</p>

<p>John never askt to see it; but she aulwaes insisted on his dooing so,
and uezd to enjoy his mascuelin amaezment at th qeer things wimen
<span class="pagenum2">345</span>
wontedw, and maed him ges whut "pieping" wuz, demand feersly th
meening of a "hug-me-tight," or wunder how a litl thing compoezd
of three roezbuds, a bit of velvet, and a paer of strings, cuud posibly
be a bonnet, and cost fiev or six dolars. That niet he luukt as if
he wuud liek th fun of qizing her figuers and pretending to be
horrified at her extravagance, as he ofen did, being particularly
proud of his proodent wief.</p>

<p>Th litl book wuz brought sloely out, and laed doun befor him.
Meg got behind his chaer under preetenss of smoothing th rinkls
out of his tierd forhed, and standing thaer, she sed, with her panik
increesing with every wurd,—</p>

<p>"John, deer, I'm ashamed to sho U mi book, for I've reealy been
dredfuly extravagant laetly. I go about so much I must hav things,
U noe, and Sallie advised mi geting it, so I did; and mi Nue-Yeer's
muny wil partly pae for it: but I wuz sorry after I'd dun it,
for I knew U'd think it rong in me."</p>

<p>John laft, and droo her round besied him, saeing guud-huemordly,
"Don't go and hied. I wun't beet U if U <em>hav</em> got a
paer of kiling boots; I'm rather proud of mi wief's feet, and don't
miend if she duz pae aet or nien dolars for her boots, if thae ar
guud wuns."</p>

<p>That had been wun of her last "trifles," and John's ie had faulen
on it as he spoek. "O, whut <em>wil</em> he sae when he cums to that
auful fifty dolars!" thaut Meg, with a shiver.</p>

<p>"It's wurss than boots, it's a silk dres," she sed, with th calmness
of desperaeshon, for she wontedw th wurst oever.</p>

<p>"Wel, deer, whut is th 'dem'd toetal,' as Mr. Mantalini sez?"</p>

<p>That didn't sound liek John, and she knew he wuz luuking up at
her with th straetforward luuk that she had aulwaes been redy to
meet and anser with wun as frank till now. She turnd th paej
and her hed at th saem tiem, pointing to th sum which wuud hav
been bad enough without th fifty, but which wuz apauling to her
with that aded. For a mienuet th room wuz verry still; then John
sed sloely,—but she cuud feel it cost him an efort to expres no
displeasure,—</p>

<p>"Wel, I don't noe that fifty is much for a dres, with all th furbelows
and noeshons U hav to hav to finish it off thees daes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">346</span>
"It isn't maed or trimmed," sighed Meg faently, for a suden recolekshon
of th cost still to be incurd qiet oeverwhelmd her.</p>

<p>"Twenty-fiev yards of silk seems a guud deel to cuver wun small
wuuman, but I've no dout mi wief wil luuk as fien as Ned Moffat's
when she gets it on," sed John driely.</p>

<p>"I noe U ar anggry, John, but I can't help it. I don't meen to
waest yuur muny, and I didn't think thoes litl things wuud count
up so. I can't rezist them when I see Sallie buying all she wonts, and
pitying me because I don't. I tri to be contented, but it is hard, and
I'm tierd of being puur."</p>

<p>Th last wurds wer spoeken so loe she thaut he did not heer
them, but he did, and thae woonded him deeply, for he had denied
himself meny plezhers for Meg's saek. She cuud hav bitten her
tung out th mienuet she had sed it, for John pushed th books
away, and got up, saeing, with a litl qiver in his vois, "I wuz
afraed of this; I do mi best, Meg." If he had scoelded her, or eeven
shaeken her, it wuud not hav broeken her hart liek thoes fue wurds.
She ran to him and held him cloez, crieing, with repentant teers, "O
John, mi deer, kiend, hard-wurking boy, I didn't meen it! It wuz so
wiked, so untroo and ungraetful, how cuud I sae it! O, how
cuud I sae it!"</p>

<p>He wuz verry kiend, forgaev her redily, and did not uter wun reproech;
but Meg knew that she had dun and sed a thing which wuud
not be forgoten soon, aultho he miet never alood to it again.
She had promist to luv him for beter for wurss; and then she, his
wief, had reproecht him with his poverty, after spending his urnestly
rekles. It wuz dredful; and th wurst of it wuz John went
on so qieetly afterward, just as if nuthing had happened, exsept that
he staed in town laeter, and wurkt at niet when she had gon to cri
herself to sleep. A week of remorss neerly maed Meg sik; and th
discuvery that John had countermanded th order for his nue graet-coet
reduest her to a staet of despaer which wuz pathetik to behoeld.
He had simply sed, in anser to her serpriezd inqierys as to th
chaenj, "I can't afford it, mi deer."</p>

<p>Meg sed no mor, but a fue minits after he found her in th haul,
with her faess berryd in th oeld graet-coet, crieing as if her hart wuud
braek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">347</span>
Thae had a long tauk that niet, and Meg lurnd to luv her huzband
beter for his poverty, because it seemd to hav maed a man of
him, given him th strength and curej to fiet his oen wae, and
taut him a tender paeshenss with which to baer and cumfort th nacheral
longings and faeluers of thoes he luvd.</p>

<p>Next dae she put her pride in her poket, went to Sallie, toeld th
trooth, and askt her to bie th silk as a faevor. Th guud-naecherd
Mrs. Moffat wilingly did so, and had th delicasy not to maek her
a prezent of it imeediatly afterward. Then Meg orderd hoem th
graet-coet, and, when John arrived, she put it on, and askt him how
he liked her nue silk goun. Wun can imajin whut anser he maed,
how he reseevd his prezent, and whut a blissful staet of things ensued.
John caem hoem eerly, Meg gaded no mor; and that graet-coet
wuz put on in th morning by a verry hapy huzband, and taeken off at
niet by a moest devoeted litl wief. So th yeer roeld round, and
at midsumer thaer caem to Meg a nue expeeri’enss,—th deepest
and tenderest of a wuuman's lief.</p>

<p>Laurie caem sneeking into th kichen of th Duv-cote, wun Saturday,
with an exsieted faess, and wuz reseevd with th clash of simbals;
for Hannah clapt her hands with a sauspan in wun and th cuver
in th uther.</p>

<p>"How's th litl maama? Whaer is everybody? Whi didn't
U tel me befor I caem hoem?" began Laurie, in a loud whisper.</p>

<p>"Hapy as a qeen, th deer! Every soel of 'em is upstaers a
worshipin'; we didn't wont no hurrycanes round. Now U go into
th parlor, and I'll send 'em doun to U," with which sumwhot involvd
replie Hannah vanisht, chukling extatikaly.</p>

<p>Prezently Jo apeerd, proudly bearing a flanel bundle laed forth
upon a larj pilo. Jo's faess wuz verry soeber, but her ies twinkled,
and thaer wuz an od sound in her vois of represt emotion of
sum sort.</p>

<p>"Shut yuur ies and hoeld out yuur arms," she sed invietingly.</p>

<p>Laurie bakt precipitately into a corner, and put his hands behind
him with an imploring jescher: "No, thank U, I'd rather not. I
shal drop it or smash it, as shuur as faet."</p>

<p>"Then U sha'n't see yuur nevvy," sed Jo decidedly, turning as if
to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">348</span>
"I wil, I wil! oenly U must be responsibl for damejes;" and,
oebaeing orders, Laurie heroeikaly shut his ies whiel sumthing wuz
put into his arms. A peel of lafter from Jo, Amy, Mrs. March,
Hannah, and John cauzd him to oepen them th next mienuet, to fiend
himself invested with too baebys insted of wun.</p>

<p>No wunder thae laft, for th expreshon of his faess wuz droel
enough to convulss a Quaker, as he stuud and staerd wieldly from th
unconshus inosents to th hilaerius spektaetors, with such dismae
that Jo sat doun on th flor and screemd.</p>

<p>"Twins, by Jupiter!" wuz all he sed for a mienuet; then, turning to
th wimen with an apeeling luuk that wuz comikaly pitius, he
aded, "Taek 'em qik, sumbody! I'm going to laf, and I shal
drop 'em."</p>

<p>John rescued his baebys, and marcht up and doun, with wun on
eech arm, as if aulredy inishiaeted into th misterys of baeby-tending,
whiel Laurie laft till th teers ran doun his cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">349</span>
"It's th best joek of th seezon, isn't it? I wouldn't hav U
toeld, for I set mi hart on serpriezing U, and I flater mieself I've
dun it," sed Jo, when she got her breth.</p>

<p>"I never wuz mor stagerd in mi lief. Isn't it fun? Ar thae
boys? Whut ar U going to naem them? Let's hav anuther luuk.
Hoeld me up, Jo; for upon mi lief it's wun too meny for me," returnd
Laurie, regarding th infants with th aer of a big, benevolent Newfoundland
luuking at a paer of infantiel kitens.</p>

<p>"Boy and gurl. Aren't thae beauties?" sed th proud papa, beeming
upon th litl, red squirmers as if thae wer unfledged aenjels.</p>

<p>"Moest remarkabl children I ever saw. Which is which?" and
Laurie bent liek a wel-sweep to examine th prodijys.</p>

<p>"Amy put a bloo ribon on th boy and a pink on th gurl, French
fashon, so U can aulwaes tel. Besieds, wun has bloo ies and wun
broun. Kis them, Unkl Teddy," sed wiked Jo.</p>

<p>"I'm afraed thae mightn't liek it," began Laurie, with uenuezhual timidity
in such maters.</p>

<p>"Of corss thae wil; thae ar uezd to it now. Do it this mienuet,
sur!" comanded Jo, feering he miet propoez a proxy.</p>

<p>Laurie scrood up his faess, and oebaed with a jinjerly peck at eech
litl cheek that produced anuther laf, and maed th baebys sqeel.</p>

<p>"Thaer, I knew thae didn't liek it! That's th boy; see him
kik; he hits out with his fists liek a guud wun. Now then, yung
Brooke, pich into a man of yuur oen size, wil U?" cried Laurie,
delieted with a poek in th faess from a tieny fist, flaping aemlesly
about.</p>

<p>"He's to be naemd John Laurence, and th gurl Margaret, after
muther and grandmuther. We shal call her Daezy, so as not to hav
too Megs, and I supoez th mannie wil be Jak, unles we fiend a

<p>"Naem him Demijon, and call him 'Demi' for short," sed
Laurie.</p>

<p>"Daezy and Demi,—just th thing! I <em>knew</em> Teddy wuud do it,"
cried Jo, claping her hands.</p>
<p>Teddy surtenly had dun it that tiem, for th baebys wer
"Daezy" and "Demi" to th end of th chapter.</p>

At that mienuet Jo wuz particularly absorbd in dresmaeking; for
she wuz mantua-maeker jeneral to th family, and tuuk especial credit
to herself because she cuud uez a needl as wel as a pen. It wuz
verry provoeking to be arest in th akt of a furst trieing-on, and
orderd out to maek calls in her best arae, on a worm July dae.
She haeted calls of th formal sort, and never maed any till Amy compeld
her with a bargan, bribe, or promis. In th prezent instanss,
thaer wuz no escaep; and having clasht her sizors rebelyusly,
whiel protesting that she smelt thunder, she gaev in, put away her
wurk, and taeking up her hat and gluvs with an aer of rezignaeshon,
toeld Amy th viktim wuz redy.</p>

<p>"Jo March, U ar pervurss enough to provoek a saent! U
don't intend to maek calls in that staet, I hoep," cried Amy, survaeing
her with amaezment.</p>

<p>"Whi not? I'm neet and cool and comfortable; qiet proper
for a dusty wauk on a worm dae. If peepl caer mor for mi cloeths
than thae do for me, I don't wish to see them. U can dres for

doesn't for me, and furbelows oenly wury me."</p>

<p>"O deer!" sighed Amy; "now she's in a contraery fit, and wil
driev me distracted befor I can get her properly redy. I'm shuur
it's no plezher to me to go to-dae, but it's a det we oe soesieety,

<p>"U're an artful litl puss to flater and wheedl yuur cros oeld

<p>"U're a perfect cherrub! Now put on all yuur best things, and

<p>Whiel Amy drest, she ishood her orders, and Jo oebaed them;
not without entering her proetest, however, for she sighed as she rusld
into her nue organdie, fround darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet
strings in an ireproechabl boe, resld vishusly with pins as
she put on her collar, rinkld up her feechers jeneraly as she shuuk

as th prezent mishon wuz to her feelings; and when she had sqeezd
her hands into tight gluvs with three butons and a tasel, as th last
tuch of eleganss, she turnd to Amy with an imbisil expreshon
of countenanss, saeing meekly,—</p>

<p>"I'm perfectly mizerabl; but if U consider me prezentabl, I
die hapy."</p>

<p>"U ar hiely satisfaktory; turn sloely round, and let me get a
careful vue." Jo revolvd, and Amy gaev a tuch heer and thaer,
then fel bak, with her hed on wun sied, obzurving graeshusly, "Yes,
U'll do; yuur hed is all I cuud ask, for that whiet bonnet <em>with</em>
th roez is qiet ravishing. Hoeld bak yuur shoulders, and carry
yuur hands eezily, no mater if yuur gluvs do pinch. Thaer's wun

verry niess to see U, and I'm so glad Ant March gaev U that
luvly wun; it's simpl, but handsum, and thoes foelds oever th arm
ar reealy artistik. Is th pointer of mi mantl in th midl, and
hav I loopt mi dres evenly? I liek to sho mi boots, for mi

<p>"U ar a thing of buety and a joy forever," sed Jo, luuking
thru her hand with th aer of a connoisseur at th bloo fether

dust, or loop it up, pleez, maa'am?"</p>

<p>"Hoeld it up when U wauk, but drop it in th hous; th sweeping
stiel suits U best, and U must lurn to trael yuur scurts graesfuly.
<span class="pagenum2">353</span>
U haeven't haf butond wun cuf; do it at wunss. U'll
never luuk finisht if U ar not careful about th litl deetaels, for
thae maek up th pleezing hoel."</p>

<p>Jo sighed, and proceeded to burst th butons off her gluv, in
dooing up her cuf; but at last boeth wer redy, and saeld away,
luuking as "prity as picters," Hannah sed, as she hung out of th
uper windo to woch them.</p>

<p>"Now, Jo deer, th Chesters consider themselvs verry elegant
peepl, so I wont U to put on yuur best deportment. Don't maek
any of yuur abrupt remarks, or do anything od, wil U? Just be
calm, cool, and qieet,—that's saef and laedyliek; and U can eezily
do it for fifteen minits," sed Amy, as thae approached th furst
plaess, having borrowed th whiet parasol and been inspekted by
Meg, with a baeby on eech arm.</p>

<p>"Let me see. 'Calm, cool, and qieet,'—yes, I think I can promis
that. I've plaed th part of a prim yung laedy on th staej, and
I'll tri it off. Mi powers ar graet, as U shal see; so be eezy in
yuur miend, mi chield."</p>

<p>Amy luukt releevd, but nauty Jo tuuk her at her wurd; for,
duuring th furst call, she sat with every lim graesfuly compoezd,
every foeld correctly draept, calm as a sumer see, cool as a sno-bank,
and as silent as a sfinx. In vaen Mrs. Chester alooded to her
"charming novel," and th Mises Chester introduest partys, picnics,
th opera, and th fashons; eech and all wer anserd by a smiel,
a boe, and a demure "Yes" or "No," with th chil on. In vaen
Amy telegraft th wurd "Tauk," tried to draw her out, and administerd
covert poeks with her fuut. Jo sat as if blandly unconshus
of it all, with deportment liek Maud's faess, "iesily reguelar,
splendidly nul."</p>

<p>"Whut a hauty, uninteresting creecher that oeldest Mis March
is!" wuz th unforchunatly audibl remark of wun of th laedys, as th
dor cloezd upon thaer guests. Jo laft noizlesly all thru
th haul, but Amy luukt disgusted at th faeluer of her instrukshons,
and verry nacheraly laed th blaem upon Jo.</p>

<p>"How cuud U mistaek me so? I meerly ment U to be
properly dignified and compoezd, and U maed yuurself a perfect
<span class="pagenum2">354</span>
stok and stoen. Tri to be soeshabl at th Lams', gosip as uther
gurls do, and be interested in dres and flurtaeshons and whotever nonsenss
cums up. Thae moov in th best soesieety, ar valueable pursons
for us to noe, and I wouldn't fael to maek a guud impreshon thaer
for anything."</p>

<p>"I'll be agreeabl; I'll gosip and gigl, and hav horrors and
rapchers oever any trifle U liek. I rather enjoy this, and now I'll
imitaet whut is called 'a charming gurl;' I can do it, for I hav Mae
Chester as a model, and I'll improov upon her. See if th Lams
don't sae, 'Whut a lievly, niess creecher that Jo March is!'"</p>

<p>Amy felt anxious, as wel she miet, for when Jo turnd freekish
thaer wuz no noeing whaer she wuud stop. Amy's faess wuz a
study when she saw her sister skim into th next drawing-room, kis
all th yung laedys with effusion, beem graeshusly upon th yung
jentlmen, and join in th chat with a spirit which amaezd th
behoelder. Amy wuz taeken possession of by Mrs. Lam, with hoom
she wuz a faevorit, and forst to heer a long account of Lucretia's
last attack, whiel three delietful yung jentlmen huverd neer,
waeting for a pause when thae miet rush in and rescue her. So
situated, she wuz powerless to chek Jo, hoo seemd possessed by a
spirit of mischif, and taukt away as voluebly as th oeld laedy. A not
of heds gatherd about her, and Amy straend her eers to heer whut
wuz going on; for broeken sentenses fild her with alarm, round ies
and uplifted hands tormented her with cueriosity, and freeqent peals
of lafter maed her wield to shaer th fun. Wun mae imajin her
sufering on oeverheering fragments of this sort of conversation:—</p>

<p>"She rieds splendidly,—hoo taut her?"</p>

<p>"No wun; she uezd to practise mounting, hoelding th raens, and
sitting straet on an oeld sadl in a tree. Now she rieds anything,
for she doesn't noe whut feer is, and th staebl-man lets her hav
horses cheep, because she traens them to carry laedys so wel. She
has such a pashon for it, I ofen tel her if everything else faels she
can be a horss-braeker, and get her living so."</p>

<p>At this auful speech Amy contained herself with dificulty, for th
impreshon wuz being given that she wuz rather a fast yung laedy,
which wuz her especial avurzhon. But whut cuud she do? for th
<span class="pagenum2">355</span>
oeld laedy wuz in th midl of her story, and long befor it wuz dun
Jo wuz off again, maeking mor droel revelaeshons, and comiting still
mor feerful blunders.</p>

<p>"Yes, Amy wuz in despaer that dae, for all th guud beests wer
gon, and of three left, wun wuz laem, wun bliend, and th uther so
balky that U had to put durt in his mouth befor he wuud start.
Niess animal for a plezher party, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Which did she chooz?" askt wun of th lafing jentlmen,
hoo enjoyd th subjekt.</p>

<p>"Nun of them; she hurd of a yung horss at th farmhous
oever th river, and, tho a laedy had never riden him, she rezolvd
to tri, because he wuz handsum and spirited. Her strugls wer
reealy pathetik; thaer wuz no wun to bring th horss to th sadl, so
she tuuk th sadl to th horss. Mi deer creecher, she akchualy
roed it oever th river, put it on her hed, and marcht up to th
barn to th uter amaezment of th oeld man!"</p>

<p>"Did she ried th horss?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">356</span>
"Of corss she did, and had a capital tiem. I expected to see her
brought hoem in fragments, but she manejd him perfectly, and wuz
th lief of th party."</p>

<p>"Wel, I call that plucky!" and yung Mr. Lam turnd an aprooving
glanss upon Amy, wundering whut his muther cuud be saeing to
maek th gurl luuk so red and uncumfortabl.</p>

<p>She wuz still reder and mor uncumfortabl a moement after, when
a suden turn in th conversation introduest th subjekt of dres.
Wun of th yung laedys askt Jo whaer she got th prity drab hat
she wor to th picnic; and stoopid Jo, insted of menshoning th
plaess whaer it wuz bought too yeers ago, must needs anser, with
unnesesaery franknes, "O, Amy paented it; U can't bie thoes
soft shaeds, so we paent ours any culor we liek. It's a graet cumfort
to hav an artistik sister."</p>

<p>"Isn't that an orijinal iedeea?" cried Mis Lam, hoo found Jo
graet fun.</p>

<p>"That's nuthing compaerd to sum of her brilliant performances.
Thaer's nuthing th chield can't do. Whi, she wontedw a paer of bloo
boots for Sallie's party, so she just paented her soild whiet wuns th
luvyest shaed of ski-bloo U ever saw, and thae luukt exaktly liek
satin," aded Jo, with an aer of pride in her sister's accomplishments
that exasperaeted Amy till she felt that it wuud be a releef to thro
her card-caess at her.</p>

<p>"We red a story of yuurs th uther dae, and enjoyd it verry much,"
obzurvd th elder Mis Lam, wishing to compliment th literaery
laedy, hoo did not luuk th carrakter just then, it must be confest.</p>

<p>Any menshon of her "wurks" aulwaes had a bad efekt upon Jo, hoo
eether groo rijid and luukt ofended, or chaenjd th subjekt with a
<i>brusque</i> remark, as now. "Sorry U cuud fiend nuthing beter to
red. I riet that rubish because it sels, and ordinaery peepl liek
it. Ar U going to Nue York this winter?"</p>

<p>As Mis Lam had "enjoyd" th story, this speech wuz not exaktly
graetful or complimentary. Th mienuet it wuz maed Jo saw her
mistaek; but, feering to maek th mater wurss, sudenly rememberd
that it wuz for her to maek th furst moov tord deparcher,
and did so with an abruptnes that left three peepl with haf-finisht
sentenses in thaer mouths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">357</span>
"Amy, we <em>must</em> go. <em>Guud</em>-by, deer; <em>do</em> cum and see 
us; we ar <i>piening</i> for a vizit. I don't daer to ask <em>U</em>, 
Mr. Lam; but if U <em>should</em> cum, I don't think I shal hav th
hart to send U away."</p>

<p>Jo sed this with such a droel imitaeshon of Mae Chester's gushing
stiel that Amy got out of th room as rapidly as posibl, feeling a strong
dezier to laf and cri at th saem tiem.</p>

<p>"Didn't I do that wel?" askt Jo, with a satisfied aer, as thae
waukt away.</p>

<p>"Nuthing cuud hav been wurss," wuz Amy's crushing replie.
"Whut possessed U to tel thoes storys about mi sadl, and th
hats and boots, and all th rest of it?"</p>

<p>"Whi, it's funy, and amuezes peepl. Thae noe we ar puur, so
it's no uez pretending that we hav grooms, bie three or foer hats a
seezon, and hav things as eezy and fien as thae do."</p>

<p>"U needn't go and tel them all our litl shifts, and expoez our
poverty in that perfectly unnesesaery wae. U haeven't a bit of
proper pride, and never wil lurn when to hoeld yuur tung and
when to speek," sed Amy despaeringly.</p>

<p>Puur Jo luukt abasht, and silently chaeft th end of her noez
with th stif hankerchif, as if performing a penanss for her misdemeenors.</p>

<p>"How shal I behaev heer?" she askt, as thae approached th
thurd manshon.</p>

<p>"Just as U pleez; I wosh mi hands of U," wuz Amy's short
anser.</p>

<p>"Then I'll enjoy mieself. Th boys ar at hoem, and we'll hav
a comfortable tiem. Guudnes noes I need a litl chaenj, for eleganss
has a bad efekt upon mi constitueshon," returnd Jo grufly,
being disturbs by her faeluers to suit.</p>

<p>An enthusiastic welcum from three big boys and several prity children
speedily soothd her rufld feelings; and, leeving Amy to entertain
th hoestes and Mr. Tudor, hoo happened to be calling liekwiez,
Jo devoeted herself to th yung foeks, and found th chaenj refreshing.
She lisend to colej storys with deep interest, caressed
pointers and poodels without a murmer, agreed hartily that "Tom
Broun wuz a brick," regardles of th improper form of praez; and
<span class="pagenum2">358</span>
when wun lad propoezd a vizit to his turtle-tank, she went with an
alacrity which cauzd maama to smiel upon her, as that mutherly
laedy setld th cap which wuz left in a rooinus condishon by filial
hugs, baer-liek but affectionate, and deerer to her than th moest faultless
<i>coiffure</i> from th hands of an inspired Frenchwoman.</p>

<p>Leeving her sister to her oen devieses, Amy proceeded to enjoy
herself to her hart's content. Mr. Tudor's unkl had marryd an
English laedy hoo wuz thurd cuzin to a living lord, and Amy regarded
th hoel family with graet respekt; for, in spiet of her American
burth and breeding, she possessed that reverenss for tietls which
haunts th best of us,—that unaknolejd loyalty to th eerly faeth
in kings which set th moest democratik naeshon under th sun in a
furment at th cuming of a royal yelo-haired laddie, sum yeers ago,
and which still has sumthing to do with th luv th yung cuntry
baers th oeld, liek that of a big sun for an impeerius litl muther,
hoo held him whiel she cuud, and let him go with a faerwel scoelding
when he rebeld. But eeven th satisfakshon of tauking with a
distant connection of th British noebility did not render Amy forgetful
of tiem; and when th proper number of minits had past, she
reluktantly tore herself from this aristocratic soesieety, and luukt about
for Jo, furvently hoeping that her incorijibl sister wuud not be found
in any pozishon which should bring disgraess upon th naem of March.</p>

</div>

<p>It miet hav been wurss, but Amy considerd it bad; for Jo sat
on th gras, with an encampment of boys about her, and a durty-fuuted
dog repoezing on th scurt of her staet and festival dres, as she relaeted
wun of Laurie's pranks to her admiering audi’enss. Wun small chield
wuz poeking turtles with Amy's cherrisht parasol, a second wuz eating
jinjerbred oever Jo's best bonnet, and a thurd plaeing baul with her
gluvs. But all wer enjoying themselvs; and when Jo colekted
her damejd property to go, her escort accompanied her, beging
her to cum again, "it wuz such fun to heer about Laurie's larks."</p>

<p>"Capital boys, aren't thae? I feel qiet yung and brisk again after
that," sed Jo, stroeling along with her hands behind her, partly from
habit, partly to conceal th bespattered parasol.</p>

<p>"Whi do U aulwaes avoid Mr. Tudor?" askt Amy, wiezly refraening
from any coment upon Jo's dilapidaeted apeeranss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">359</span>
"Don't liek him; he puts on aers, snubs his sisters, wurys his
faather, and doesn't speek respektfuly of his muther. Laurie sez he
is fast, and <em>I</em> don't consider him a dezierabl aqaentanss; so I let
him aloen."</p>

<p>"U miet treat him sivily, at leest. U gaev him a cool nod;
and just now U bowd and smield in th politest wae to Tommy
Chaemberlen, hoos faather keeps a groesery stor. If U had just
revurst th nod and th boe, it wuud hav been riet," sed Amy
reproovingly.</p>

<p>"No, it wouldn't," returnd pervurss Jo; "I neether liek, respekt,
nor admier Tudor, tho his grandfaather's unkl's nefue's neess
<em>wuz</em> thurd cuzin to a lord. Tommy is puur and bashful and guud
and verry clever; I think wel of him, and liek to sho that I do, for
he <em>is</em> a jentlman in spiet of th broun-paeper parsels."</p>

<p>"It's no uez trieing to argue with U," began Amy.</p>

<p>"Not th leest, mi deer," interupted Jo; "so let us luuk aemiabl,
and drop a card heer, as th Kings ar evidently out, for which I'm
deeply graetful."</p>

<p>Th family card-caess having dun its duty, th gurls waukt on,
and Jo uterd anuther thanksgiving on reeching th fifth hous, and
being toeld that th yung laedys wer engaejd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">360</span>
"Now let us go hoem, and never miend Ant March to-dae. We
can run doun thaer any tiem, and it's reealy a pity to trael thru th
dust in our best bibs and tuckers, when we ar tierd and cros."</p>

<p>"Speek for yuurself, if U pleez. Ant lieks to hav us pae her
th compliment of cuming in stiel, and maeking a formal call; it's a
litl thing to do, but it givs her plezher, and I don't beleev it wil
hurt yuur things haf so much as leting durty dogs and clumping boys
spoil them. Stoop doun, and let me taek th crums off of yuur
bonnet."</p>

<p>"Whut a guud gurl U ar, Amy!" sed Jo, with a repentant glanss
from her oen damejd costume to that of her sister, which wuz fresh
and spotless still. "I wish it wuz as eezy for me to do litl things to
pleez peepl as it is for U. I think of them, but it taeks too much
tiem to do them; so I waet for a chanss to confur a graet faevor, and
let th small wuns slip; but thae tel best in th end, I fansy."</p>

<p>Amy smield, and wuz molified at wunss, saeing with a maturnal
aer,—</p>

<p>"Wimen should lurn to be agreeabl, particularly puur wuns; for
thae hav no uther wae of re-paeing th kiendneses thae reseev. If
U'd remember that, and practise it, U'd be beter liked than I
am, because thaer is mor of U."</p>

<p>"I'm a crochety oeld thing, and aulwaes shal be, but I'm wiling
to oen that U ar riet; oenly it's eezyer for me to risk mi lief for
a purson than to be plezant to him when I don't feel liek it. It's a
graet misforchun to hav such strong lieks and dislieks, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's a graeter not to be aebl to hied them. I don't miend saeing
that I don't aproov of Tudor any mor than U do; but I'm not
called upon to tel him so; neether ar U, and thaer is no uez in
maeking yuurself disagreeabl because he is."</p>

<p>"But I think gurls aut to sho when thae disaproov of yung
men; and how can thae do it exsept by thaer maners? Preeching
duz not do any guud, as I noe to mi sorro, sinss I've had Teddy
to manej; but thaer ar meny litl waes in which I can inflooenss
him without a wurd, and I sae we <em>aut</em> to do it to others if we can."</p>

<p>"Teddy is a remarkabl boy, and can't be taeken as a sampl of
uther boys," sed Amy, in a toen of solem convikshon, which wuud
<span class="pagenum2">361</span>
hav convulst th "remarkabl boy," if he had hurd it. "If we
wer belles, or wimen of welth and pozishon, we miet do sumthing,
perhaps; but for us to froun at wun set of yung jentlmen
because we don't aproov of them, and smiel upon anuther set because
we do, wouldn't hav a partikl of efekt, and we should oenly
be considerd od and puritanical."</p>

<p>"So we ar to countenanss things and peepl which we detest,
meerly because we ar not belles and milyonaers, ar we? That's
a niess sort of morality."</p>

<p>"I can't argue about it, I oenly noe that it's th wae of th wurld;
and peepl hoo set themselvs against it oenly get laft at for thaer
paens. I don't liek reformers, and I hoep U wil never tri to be wun."</p>

<p>"I do liek them, and I shal be wun if I can; for in spiet of th
lafing, th wurld wuud never get on without them. We can't
agree about that, for U belong to th oeld set, and I to th nue:
U wil get on th best, but I shal hav th lievlyest tiem of it. I
should rather enjoy th brickbats and hooting, I think."</p>

<p>"Wel, compoez yuurself now, and don't wury ant with yuur nue
iedeeas."</p>

<p>"I'll tri not to, but I'm aulwaes possessed to burst out with sum
particularly blunt speech or revolooshonaery sentiment befor her; it's
mi doom, and I can't help it."</p>

<p>Thae found Ant Carrol with th oeld laedy, boeth absorbd in sum
verry interesting subjekt; but thae dropt it as th gurls caem in,
with a conshus luuk which betraed that thae had been tauking
about thaer neeses. Jo wuz not in a guud huemor, and th pervurss
fit returnd; but Amy, hoo had vurchu’usly dun her duty, kept her
temper, and pleezd everybody, wuz in a moest anjelik fraem of miend.
This aemiabl spirit wuz felt at wunss, and boeth th aunts "mi deared"
her affectionately, luuking whut thae afterwards sed emfatikaly,—"That
chield improovs every dae."</p>

<p>"Ar U going to help about th faer, deer?" askt Mrs. Carrol,
as Amy sat doun besied her with th confieding aer elderly peepl liek
so wel in th yung.</p>

<p>"Yes, ant. Mrs. Chester askt me if I wuud, and I oferd to
tend a taebl, as I hav nuthing but mi tiem to giv."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">362</span>
"I'm not," put in Jo decidedly. "I haet to be patronized, and th
Chesters think it's a graet faevor to alow us to help with thaer hiely
connected faer. I wunder U consented, Amy: thae oenly wont U
to wurk."</p>

<p>"I am wiling to wurk: it's for th freedmen as wel as th
Chesters, and I think it verry kiend of them to let me shaer th laebor
and th fun. Patronage duz not trubl me when it is wel ment."</p>

<p>"Qiet riet and proper. I liek yuur graetful spirit, mi deer; it's
a plezher to help peepl hoo appreciate our eforts: sum do not,
and that is trieing," obzurvd Ant March, luuking oever her spektakls at

cannot see whut goes on in th miends of our frends; beter for us that

<p class="h2a">CONSEQUENCES.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Mrs. Chester's</span> faer wuz so verry elegant and selekt that it wuz
considerd a graet onor by th yung laedys of th naeborhuud to
be invieted to taek a taebl, and every wun wuz much interested in th
mater. Amy wuz askt, but Jo wuz not, which wuz forchunat for all
partys, as her elboes wer decidedly akimbo at this period of her lief,
and it tuuk a guud meny hard noks to teech her how to get on
eezily. Th "hauty, uninteresting creecher" wuz let seveerly aloen;
but Amy's talent and taest wer duely complimented by th ofer of th
art-taebl, and she exerted herself to prepaer and secuer aproepriat
and valueable contributions to it.</p>

<p>Everything went on smoothly till th dae befor th faer oepend;
then thaer ocurd wun of th litl skirmishes which it is aulmoest imposibl
<span class="pagenum2">366</span>
to avoid, when sum fiev and twenty wimen, oeld and yung,
with all thaer private piques and prejudises, tri to wurk together.</p>

<p>Mae Chester wuz rather jelus of Amy because th later wuz a
graeter faevorit than herself, and, just at this tiem, several trifling
surcumstanses ocurd to increess th feeling. Amy's dainty pen-and-ink
wurk entierly eclipst Mae's paented vaeses,—that wuz wun
thorn; then th all-conkering Tudor had danst foer times with
Amy, at a laet party, and oenly wunss with Mae,—that wuz thorn number
too; but th cheef greevanss that rankld in her soel, and gaev
her an excuez for her unfrendly conduct, wuz a roomor which sum
obliejing gosip had whisperd to her, that th March gurls had maed
fun of her at th Lams'. All th blaem of this should hav faulen
upon Jo, for her nauty imitaeshon had been too liefliek to escaep
detekshon, and th froliksum Lams had permited th joek to escaep.
No hint of this had reached th culprits, however, and Amy's dismae
can be imajind, when, th verry evening befor th faer, as she wuz
putting th last tuches to her prity taebl, Mrs. Chester, hoo, of
corss, rezented th supoezd ridicuel of her dauter, sed, in a bland
toen, but with a coeld luuk,—</p>

<p>"I fiend, deer, that thaer is sum feeling amung th yung laedys
about mi giving this taebl to any wun but mi gurls. As this is th
moest prominent, and sum sae th moest atraktiv taebl of all, and
thae ar th cheef getters-up of th faer, it is thaut best for them to
taek this plaess. I'm sorry, but I noe U ar too sincerely interested
in th cauz to miend a litl pursonal disapointment, and U
shal hav anuther taebl if U liek."</p>

<p>Mrs. Chester had fansyd beforehand that it wuud be eezy to
deliver this litl speech; but when th tiem caem, she found it rather
dificult to uter it nacheraly, with Amy's unsuspicious ies luuking
straet at her, fuul of serpriez and trubl.</p>

<p>Amy felt that thaer wuz sumthing behind this, but cuud not ges
whut, and sed qieetly, feeling hurt, and shoeing that she did,—</p>

<p>"Perhaps U had rather I tuuk no taebl at all?"</p>

<p>"Now, mi deer, don't hav any il feeling, I beg; it's meerly a
mater of expeedi’ensy, U see; mi gurls wil nacheraly taek th leed,
and this taebl is considerd thaer proper plaess. <em>I</em> think it 
verry aproepriat <span class="pagenum2">367</span>
to U, and feel verry graetful for yuur eforts to maek it so
prity; but we must giv up our private wishes, of corss, and I wil
see that U hav a guud plaess elsewhere. Wouldn't U liek th
flower-taebl? Th litl gurls undertuuk it, but thae ar discurejd.
U cuud maek a charming thing of it, and th flower-taebl is aulwaes
atraktiv, U noe."</p>

<p>"Especially to jentlmen," aded Mae, with a luuk which enlightened
Amy as to wun cauz of her suden faul from faevor. She
culord anggrily, but tuuk no uther noetis of that gurlish sarcazm, and
anserd, with unexpekted aemiability,—</p>

<p>"It shal be as U pleez, Mrs. Chester. I'll giv up mi plaess
heer at wunss, and atend to th flowers, if U liek."</p>

<p>"U can put yuur oen things on yuur oen taebl, if U prefur,"
began Mae, feeling a litl conshenss-striken, as she luukt at th
prity raks, th paented shels, and qaent iloominaeshons Amy had so
carefully maed and so graesfuly araenjd. She ment it kiendly, but
Amy mistuuk her meening, and sed qikly,—</p>

<p>"O, surtenly, if thae ar in yuur wae;" and sweeping her contributions
into her apron, pelmel, she waukt off, feeling that
herself and her wurks of art had been insulted past forgivnes.</p>

<p>"Now she's mad. O, deer, I wish I hadn't askt U to speek,
maama," sed Mae, luuking disconsolatly at th empty spaeses on her
taebl.</p>

<p>"Gurls' qorrels ar soon oever," returnd her muther, feeling a trifle
ashamed of her oen part in this wun, as wel she miet.</p>

<p>Th litl gurls haeld Amy and her treasures with deliet, which
corjal resepshon sumwhot soothd her perturbed spirit, and she fel
to wurk, deturmind to succeed florally, if she cuud not artistikaly.
But everything seemd against her: it wuz laet, and she wuz tierd;
every wun wuz too busy with thaer oen affairs to help her; and th
litl gurls wer oenly hindranses, for th dears fust and chaterd
liek so meny magpies, maeking a graet deel of confuezhon in thaer artles
eforts to prezurv th moest perfect order. Th evergreen arch
wouldn't stae furm after she got it up, but wigld and thretend to
tumbl doun on her hed when th hanging baskets wer fild; her
best tiel got a splash of wauter, which left a seepia teer on th Cuepid's
<span class="pagenum2">368</span>
cheek; she broozd her hands with hamering, and got coeld wurking
in a draft, which last aflikshon fild her with aprehenshons for th
morro. Any gurl-reeder hoo has suferd liek aflikshons wil sympathize
with puur Amy, and wish her wel thru with her task.</p>

<p>Thaer wuz graet indignaeshon at hoem when she toeld her story that
evening. Her muther sed it wuz a shaem, but toeld her she had dun
riet; Beth declaerd she wouldn't go to th faer at all; and Jo demanded
whi she didn't taek all her prity things and leev thoes meen
peepl to get on without her.</p>

<p>"Because thae ar meen is no reezon whi I should be. I haet
such things, and tho I think I've a riet to be hurt, I don't
intend to sho it. Thae wil feel that mor than anggry speeches or
hufy akshons, wun't thae, Marmee?"</p>

<p>"That's th riet spirit, mi deer; a kis for a blo is aulwaes best,
tho it's not verry eezy to giv it sumtiems," sed her muther, with
th aer of wun hoo had lurnd th diferenss between preeching and
practising.</p>

<p>In spiet of vaerius verry nacheral temptaeshons to rezent and retaliaet,
Amy adheerd to her rezolooshon all th next dae, bent on conkering her
enemy by kiendnes. She began wel, thanks to a silent remiender that
caem to her unexpectedly, but moest opportunely. As she araenjd
her taebl that morning, whiel th litl gurls wer in an ante-room filing
th baskets, she tuuk up her pet produkshon,—a litl book, th
anteek cuver of which her faather had found amung his treasures, and
in which, on leevs of vellum, she had beautifully iloominaeted diferent
texts. As she turnd th paejes, rich in dainty devieses, with verry pardonable
pride, her ie fel upon wun vurss that maed her stop and
think. Fraemd in a brilliant scroel-wurk of scarlet, bloo, and goeld,
with litl spirits of guud-wil helping wun anuther up and doun
amung th thorns and flowers, wer th wurds, "Thow shalt luv thi
naebor as thyself."</p>

<p>"I aut, but I don't," thaut Amy, as her ie went from th
briet paej to Mae's discontented faess behind th big vaeses, that
cuud not hied th vaecansys her prity wurk had wunss fild. Amy
stuud a mienuet, turning th leevs in her hand, reeding on eech sum
sweet rebuek for all hart-burnings and uncharitableness of spirit.
<span class="pagenum2">369</span>
Meny wiez and troo surmons ar preecht us every dae by unconshus
ministers in street, scool, ofis, or hoem; eeven a faer-taebl
mae becum a pulpit, if it can ofer th guud and helpful wurds which
ar never out of seezon. Amy's conshenss preecht her a litl surmon
from that text, then and thaer; and she did whut meny of us do
not aulwaes do,—tuuk th surmon to hart, and straetwae put it in
praktis.</p>

<p>A groop of gurls wer standing about Mae's taebl, admiering th
prity things, and tauking oever th chaenj of saelzwimen. Thae
dropt thaer voises, but Amy knew thae wer speeking of her, heering
wun sied of th story, and jujing acordingly. It wuz not
plezant, but a beter spirit had cum oever her, and prezently a chanss
oferd for prooving it. She hurd Mae sae sorroefuly,—</p>

<p>"It's too bad, for thaer is no tiem to maek uther things, and I
don't wont to fil up with ods and ends. Th taebl wuz just complete
then: now it's spoilt."</p>

<p>"I daer sae she'd put them bak if U askt her," sugjested sum
wun.</p>

<p>"How cuud I after all th fus?" began Mae, but she did not
finish, for Amy's vois caem acros th haul, saeing pleasantly,—</p>

<p>"U mae hav them, and welcum, without asking, if U wont
them. I wuz just thinking I'd ofer to put them bak, for thae belong
to yuur taebl rather than mien. Heer thae ar; pleez taek them,
and forgiv me if I wuz hasty in carrying them away last niet."</p>

<p>As she spoek, Amy returnd her contribution, with a nod and a smiel,
and huryd away again, feeling that it wuz eezyer to do a frendly
thing than it wuz to stae and be thankt for it.</p>

<p>"Now, I call that luvly of her, don't U?" cried wun gurl.</p>

<p>Mae's anser wuz inaudibl; but anuther yung laedy, hoos temper
wuz evidently a litl sourd by maeking lemonaed, aded, with a disagreeabl
laf, "Verry luvly; for she knew she wouldn't sel them at
her oen taebl."</p>

<p>Now, that wuz hard; when we maek litl sacrifieses we liek to hav
them appreciated, at leest; and for a mienuet Amy wuz sorry she had
dun it, feeling that vurchoo wuz not aulwaes its oen reword. But it
is,—as she prezently discuverd; for her spirits began to riez, and
<span class="pagenum2">370</span>
her taebl to blossom under her skilful hands; th gurls wer verry
kiend, and that wun litl akt seemd to hav cleerd th atmosphere
amaezingly.</p>

<p>It wuz a verry long dae, and a hard wun to Amy, as she sat behind
her taebl, ofen qiet aloen, for th litl gurls dezurted verry soon: fue
caerd to bie flowers in sumer, and her bouquets began to droop long
befor niet.</p>

<p>Th art-taebl <em>wuz</em> th moest atraktiv in th room; thaer wuz a
croud about it all dae long, and th tenders wer constantly flieing to
and fro with important faeses and ratling muny-boxes. Amy ofen
luukt wistfuly acros, longing to be thaer, whaer she felt at hoem
and hapy, insted of in a corner with nuthing to do. It miet seem
no hardship to sum of us; but to a prity, blithe yung gurl, it wuz
not oenly teedius, but verry trieing; and th thaut of being found
thaer in th evening by her family, and Laurie and his frends, maed
it a reeal marterdom.</p>

<p>She did not go hoem till niet, and then she luukt so pale and
qieet that thae knew th dae had been a hard wun, tho she
maed no complaent, and did not eeven tel whut she had dun. Her
muther gaev her an extra corjal cup of tee, Beth helpt her dres,
and maed a charming litl reeth for her haer, whiel Jo astonisht
her family by geting herself up with uenuezhual caer, and hinting darkly
that th taebls wer about to be turnd.</p>

<p>"Don't do anything rood, prae, Jo. I wun't hav any fus maed,
so let it all pas, and behaev yuurself," begd Amy, as she departed
eerly, hoeping to fiend a re-inforsment of flowers to refreshes her puur
litl taebl.</p>

<p>"I meerly intend to maek mieself entrancingly agreeabl to every
wun I noe, and to keep them in yuur corner as long as posibl.
Teddy and his boys wil lend a hand, and we'll hav a guud tiem
yet," returnd Jo, leening oever th gaet to woch for Laurie. Prezently
th familyar tramp wuz hurd in th dusk, and she ran out to
meet him.</p>

<p>"Is that mi boy?"</p>

<p>"As shuur as this is mi gurl!" and Laurie tukt her hand under
his arm, with th aer of a man hoos every wish wuz gratified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">371</span>
"O Teddy, such dooings!" and Jo toeld Amy's rongs with sisterly
zeel.</p>

<p>"A flok of our feloes ar going to driev oever by and by, and I'll
be hangd if I don't maek them bie every flower she's got, and camp
doun befor her taebl afterward," sed Laurie, espousing her cauz
with warmth.</p>

<p>"Th flowers ar not at all niess, Amy sez, and th fresh wuns mae
not arrive in tiem. I don't wish to be unjust or suspishus, but I
shouldn't wunder if thae never caem at all. When peepl do wun
meen thing thae ar verry liekly to do anuther," obzurvd Jo, in a
disgusted toen.</p>

<p>"Didn't Hayes giv U th best out of our gardens? I toeld him
to."</p>

<p>"I didn't noe that; he forgot, I supoez; and, as yuur grandpa
wuz poorly, I didn't liek to wury him by asking, tho I did wont
sum."</p>

<p>"Now, Jo, how cuud U think thaer wuz any need of asking!
Thae ar just as much yuurs as mien. Don't we aulwaes go havs in
everything?" began Laurie, in th toen that aulwaes maed Jo turn
thorny.</p>

<p>"Graeshus, I hoep not! haf of sum of yuur things wouldn't suit
me at all. But we mustn't stand philandering heer; I've got to help
Amy, so U go and maek yuurself splendid; and if U'll be so verry
kiend as to let Hayes taek a fue niess flowers up to th Haul, I'll bles
U forever."</p>

<p>"Couldn't U do it now?" askt Laurie, so suggestively that Jo
shut th gaet in his faess with inhospitabl haest, and called thru
th bars, "Go away, Teddy; I'm busy."</p>

<p>Thanks to th conspirators, th taebls <em>wer</em> turnd that niet; for
Hayes sent up a wildernes of flowers, with a luvly basket, araenjd
in his best maner, for a senter-peess; then th March family turnd
out <i>en masse</i>, and Jo exerted herself to sum purpos, for peepl not
oenly caem, but staed, lafing at her nonsenss, admiering Amy's taest,
and apparently enjoying themselvs verry much. Laurie and his
frends galantly throo themselvs into th breach, bought up th bouquets,
encamped befor th taebl, and maed that corner th lievlyest
<span class="pagenum2">372</span>
spot in th room. Amy wuz in her element now, and, out of gratitood,
if nuthing mor, wuz as sprietly and graeshus as posibl,—cuming
to th concloozhon, about that tiem, that vurchoo <em>wuz</em> its oen
reword, after all.</p>

</div>

<p>Jo behaevd herself with exemplary propriety; and when Amy wuz
hapily serounded by her gard of onor, Jo surcuelaeted about th
haul, piking up vaerius bits of gosip, which enlightened her upon
th subjekt of th Chester chaenj of baess. She reproecht herself
for her shaer of th il-feeling, and rezolvd to exoneraet Amy as soon
as posibl; she aulso discuverd whut Amy had dun about th things
in th morning, and considerd her a model of magnanimity. As she
past th art-taebl, she glanst oever it for her sister's things, but saw
no siens of them. "Tukt away out of siet, I daer sae," thaut
Jo, hoo cuud forgiv her oen rongs, but hotly rezented any insult
oferd to her family.</p>

<p>"Guud evening, Mis Jo. How duz Amy get on?" askt Mae,
with a conciliatory aer, for she wontedw to sho that she aulso cuud
be jenerus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">373</span>
"She has soeld everything she had that wuz wurth seling, and now
she is enjoying herself. Th flower-taebl is aulwaes atraktiv, U
noe, 'especially to jentlmen.'"</p>

<p>Jo <em>couldn't</em> rezist giving that litl slap, but Mae tuuk it so meekly
she regreted it a mienuet after, and fel to praezing th graet vaeses,
which still remaend unsoeld.</p>

<p>"Is Amy's iloominaeshon anywhere about? I tuuk a fansy to bie
that for faather," sed Jo, verry anxious to lurn th faet of her sister's
wurk.</p>

<p>"Everything of Amy's soeld long ago; I tuuk caer that th riet
peepl saw them, and thae maed a niess litl sum of muny for us,"
returnd Mae, hoo had oevercum sundry small temptaeshons, as wel as
Amy, that dae.</p>

<p>Much gratified, Jo rusht bak to tel th guud nues; and Amy
luukt boeth tucht and serpriezd by th report of Mae's wurds and
maner.</p>

<p>"Now, jentlmen, I wont U to go and do yuur duty by th uther
taebls as jenerusly as U hav by mien—especially th art-taebl,"
she sed, ordering out "Teddy's Oen," as th gurls called th colej
frends.</p>

<p>"'Charj, Chester, charj!' is th moto for that taebl; but do
yuur duty liek men, and U'll get yuur muny's wurth of <em>art</em> 
in every senss of th wurd," sed th irepresibl Jo, as th devoeted 
phalanx prepaerd to taek th feeld.</p>

<p>"To heer is to oebae, but March is faerer far than Mae," sed litl
Parker, maeking a frantik efort to be boeth wity and tender, and geting
promptly qencht by Laurie, hoo sed, "Verry wel, mi sun,
for a small boy!" and waukt him off, with a paturnal pat on th
hed.</p>

<p>"Bie th vaeses," whisperd Amy to Laurie, as a fienal heeping of
coels of fier on her enemy's hed.</p>

<p>To Mae's graet deliet, Mr. Laurence not oenly bought th vaeses,
but pervaeded th haul with wun under eech arm. Th uther jentlmen
specuelaeted with equal rashnes in all sorts of frael trifles, and
waanderd helplessly about afterward, burdend with wax flowers,
paented fans, filigree portfolios, and uther uesful and aproepriat
purchases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">374</span>
Ant Carrol wuz thaer, hurd th story, luukt pleezd, and sed
sumthing to Mrs. March in a corner, which maed th later laedy beem
with satisfakshon, and woch Amy with a faess fuul of minggld pride
and anxiety, tho she did not betrae th cauz of her plezher till
several daes laeter.</p>

<p>Th faer wuz pronounced a success; and when Mae bade Amy guud
niet, she did not "gush" as uezhual, but gaev her an affectionate kis,
and a luuk which sed, "Forgiv and forget." That satisfied Amy;
and when she got hoem she found th vaeses paraded on th parlor
chimny-peess, with a graet bouquet in eech. "Th reword of merrit
for a magnanimus March," as Laurie anounst with a flurish.</p>

<p>"U've a deel mor prinsipl and jenerosity and nobleness of
carrakter than I ever gaev U credit for, Amy. U've behaevd
sweetly, and I respekt U with all mi hart," sed Jo wormly, as thae
brushed thaer haer together laet that niet.</p>

<p>"Yes, we all do, and luv her for being so redy to forgiv. It
must hav been dredfuly hard, after wurking so long, and setting
yuur hart on seling yuur oen prity things. I don't beleev I cuud
hav dun it as kiendly as U did," aded Beth from her pilo.</p>

<p>"Whi, gurls, U needn't praez me so; I oenly did as I'd be dun
by. U laf at me when I sae I wont to be a laedy, but I meen
a troo jentlwuuman in miend and maners, and I tri to do it as
far as I noe how. I can't explaen exaktly, but I wont to be abuv
th litl meannesses and folys and faults that spoil so meny
wimen. I'm far from it now, but I do mi best, and hoep in tiem to
be whut muther is."</p>

<p>Amy spoek urnestly, and Jo sed, with a corjal hug,—</p>

<p>"I understand now whut U meen, and I'll never laf at U
again. U ar geting on faster than U think, and I'll taek lesons
of U in troo polietnes, for U've lurnd th seecret, I beleev.
Tri away, deary; U'll get yuur reword sum dae, and no wun wil be
mor delieted than I shal."</p>

<p>A week laeter Amy did get her reword, and puur Jo found it hard
to be delieted. A leter caem from Ant Carrol, and Mrs. March's
faess wuz iloominaeted to such a degree, when she red it, that Jo and
Beth, hoo wer with her, demanded whut th glad tidings wer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">375</span>
"Ant Carrol is going abraud next munth, and wonts—"</p>

<p>"Me to go with her!" burst in Jo, flieing out of her chaer in an
uncontroelabl rapcher.</p>

<p>"No, deer, not U; it's Amy."</p>

<p>"O muther! she's too yung; it's mi turn furst. I've wontedw
it so long—it wuud do me so much guud, and be so aultogether splendid—I
<em>must</em> go."</p>

<p>"I'm afraed it's imposibl, Jo. Ant sez Amy, decidedly, and it
is not for us to diktaet when she ofers such a faevor."</p>

<p>"It's aulwaes so. Amy has all th fun and I hav all th wurk. It
isn't faer, o, it isn't faer!" cried Jo pashonatly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraed it is partly yuur oen fault, deer. When Ant spoek to
me th uther dae, she regreted yuur blunt maners and too independent
spirit; and heer she riets, as if qoeting sumthing U had
sed,—'I pland at furst to ask Jo; but as "faevors burden her," and
she "haets French," I think I wun't venture to inviet her. Amy is
mor docile, wil maek a guud companyon for Flo, and reseev graetfuly
any help th trip mae giv her.'"</p>

<p>"O, mi tung, mi abominabl tung! whi can't I lurn to
keep it qieet?" groend Jo, remembering wurds which had been her
undoing. When she had hurd th explanaeshon of th qoeted phrases,
Mrs. March sed sorroefuly,—</p>

<p>"I wish U cuud hav gon, but thaer is no hoep of it this tiem;
so tri to baer it cheerfuly, and don't sadden Amy's plezher by reproeches
or regrets."</p>

<p>"I'll tri," sed Jo, winking hard, as she knelt doun to pik up th
basket she had joyfuly upset. "I'll taek a leef out of her book, and
tri not oenly to seem glad, but to be so, and not gruj her wun mienuet
of hapynes; but it wun't be eezy, for it is a dredful disapointment;"
and puur Jo bedewed th litl fat pincuushon she held
with several verry biter teers.</p>

<p>"Jo, deer, I'm verry selfish, but I couldn't spaer U, and I'm glad
U ar not going qiet yet," whisperd Beth, embracing her, basket
and all, with such a clinging tuch and luving faess, that Jo felt cumforted
in spiet of th sharp regret that maed her wont to box her oen
eers, and humbly beg Ant Carrol to burden her with this faevor, and
see how graetfuly she wuud baer it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">376</span>
By th tiem Amy caem in, Jo wuz aebl to taek her part in th family
joobilaeshon; not qiet as hartily as uezhual, perhaps, but without
repinings at Amy's guud forchun. Th yung laedy herself reseevd th
nues as tidings of graet joy, went about in a solem sort of rapcher,
and began to sort her culors and pak her pensils that evening, leeving
such trifles as cloeths, muny, and passports to thoes les
absorbd in vizhons of art than herself.</p>

<p>"It isn't a meer plezher trip to me, gurls," she sed impresivly,
as she scraept her best palette. "It wil desied mi career; for if I
hav any jeenyus, I shal fiend it out in Rome, and wil do sumthing
to proov it."</p>

<p>"Supoez U haeven't?" sed Jo, soeing away, with red ies, at
th nue collars which wer to be handed oever to Amy.</p>

<p>"Then I shal cum hoem and teech drawing for mi living," replied
th aspirant for faem, with philosophic composure; but she maed a
rie faess at th prospekt, and scracht away at her palette as if bent
on vigorus mezhers befor she gaev up her hoeps.</p>

<p>"No, U wun't; U haet hard wurk, and U'll marry sum rich
man, and cum hoem to sit in th lap of lukshery all yuur daes,"

<p>"Yuur predictions sumtiems cum to pas, but I don't beleev that

I should liek to be aebl to help thoes hoo ar," sed Amy, smieling, as
if th part of Laedy Bountiful wuud suit her beter than that of a puur

<p>"Hum!" sed Jo, with a sie; "if U wish it U'll hav it, for
yuur wishes ar aulwaes granted—mien never."</p>

<p>"Wuud U liek to go?" askt Amy, thautfuly pating her

<p>"Rather!"</p>

<p>"Wel, in a yeer or too I'll send for U, and we'll dig in th
Forum for reliks, and carry out all th plans we've maed so meny

<p>"Thank U; I'll remiend U of yuur promis when that joyful

magnifisent ofer as graetfuly as she cuud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">377</span>
Thaer wuz not much tiem for preparaeshon, and th hous wuz in a
furment till Amy wuz off. Jo bor up verry wel till th last flutter of
bloo ribon vanisht, when she retierd to her refuej, th garret, and
cried till she couldn't cri any mor. Amy liekwiez bor up stoutly
till th steemer saeld; then, just as th ganwae wuz about to be
withdrawn, it sudenly caem oever her that a hoel oeshan wuz soon to
roel between her and thoes hoo luvd her best, and she clung to
Laurie, th last linggerer, saeing with a sob,—</p>

<p>"O, taek caer of them for me; and if anything should hapen—"</p>

<p>"I wil, deer, I wil; and if anything happens, I'll cum and cumfort
U," whisperd Laurie, litl dreeming that he wuud be called
upon to keep his wurd.</p>

<p>So Amy saeld away to fiend th oeld wurld, which is aulwaes nue and
buetiful to yung ies, whiel her faather and frend wocht her from
th shor, furvently hoeping that nun but jentl forchuns wuud befall
th hapy-hearted gurl, hoo waevd her hand to them till thae cuud
see nuthing but th sumer sunshine dazling on th see.</p>

Such wauks on dek, such sunsets, such splendid aer and waevs!
It wuz aulmoest as exsieting as rieding a fast horss, when we went rushing

<p>"It wuz all hevenly, but I wuz glad to see th Irish coest, and
found it verry luvly, so green and suny, with broun cabins heer and

"At Queenstown wun of mi nue acquaintances left us,—Mr.

<p class="noindent">Wasn't that nonsensikal?</p>

<p>"We oenly stopt at Liverpool a fue ours. It's a durty, noizy
plaess, and I wuz glad to leev it. Unkl rusht out and bought a
paer of dog-skin gluvs, sum ugly, thik shoos, and an umbrela, and
got shaevd <i>à laa</i> muton-chop, th furst thing. Then he 
flaterd himself that he luukt liek a troo Briton; but th furst 
tiem he had th mud cleend off his shoos, th litl bootblack knew 
that an American stuud in them, and sed, with a grin, 'Thaer yer har, 
sur. I've giv 'em
<span class="pagenum2">380</span>
th laetest Yankee shien.' It amuezd unkl imensly. O, I <em>must</em>
tel U whut that absurd Lennox did! He got his frend Word, hoo
caem on with us, to order a bouquet for me, and th furst thing I saw
in mi room wuz a luvly wun, with 'Robert Lennox's compliments,'
on th card. Wasn't that fun, gurls? I liek travelling.</p>

<p>"I never <em>shal</em> get to London if I don't hurry. Th trip wuz liek
rieding thru a long pikcher-galery, fuul of luvly landscaeps. Th
farmhouzes wer mi deliet; with thacht roofs, ievy up to th eevs,
latist windoes, and stout wimen with roezy children at th dors.
Th verry catl luukt mor tranquil than ours, as thae stuud nee-deep
in cloever, and th hens had a contented cluk, as if thae never
got nurvus, liek Yankee biddies. Such perfect culor I never saw,—th
gras so green, ski so bloo, graen so yelo, wuuds so dark,—I wuz
in a rapcher all th wae. So wuz Flo; and we kept bounsing from
wun sied to th uther, trieing to see everything whiel we wer whisking
along at th raet of sixty miels an our. Ant wuz tierd and went
to sleep, but unkl red his gied-book, and wouldn't be astonisht at
anything. This is th wae we went on: Amy, flieing up,—'O, that
must be Kenilworth, that grae plaess amung th trees!' Flo, darting
to mi windo,—'How sweet! We must go thaer sum tiem, wun't
we, papa?' Unkl, calmly admiering his boots,—'No, mi deer, not
unles U wont beer; that's a brooery.'</p>

<p>"A pause,—then Flo cried out, 'Bles me, thaer's a galoes and
a man going up.' 'Whaer, whaer?' shreeks Amy, staering out at too
taul poests with a cros-beem and sum dangling chaens. 'A colliery,'
remarks unkl, with a twinkle of th ie. 'Heer's a luvly flok of
<ins title="Add comma after lying down"> 
lams all lieing doun,' sez Amy.</ins> 'See, papa, aren't thae prity!'
aded Flo sentimentaly. 'Geess, yung laedys,' returns unkl, in a
toen that keeps us qieet till Flo setls doun to enjoy 'Th Flurtaeshons
of Capt. Cavendish,' and I hav th seenery all to mieself.</p>

<p>"Of corss it raend when we got to London, and thaer wuz nuthing
to be seen but fog and umbrelas. We rested, unpakt, and
shopt a litl between th showers. Ant Mary got me sum nue
things, for I caem off in such a hurry I wasn't haf redy. A whiet
hat and bloo fether, a muzlin dres to mach, and th luvyest mantl
U ever saw. Shoping in Reejent Street is perfectly splendid;
<span class="pagenum2">381</span>
things seem so cheep—niess ribons oenly sixpence a yard. I laed in
a stok, but shal get mi gluvs in Paris. Doesn't that sound sort of
elegant and rich?</p>

<p>"Flo and I, for th fun of it, orderd a hansom cab, whiel ant
and unkl wer out, and went for a driev, tho we lurnd afterward
that it wasn't th thing for yung laedys to ried in them aloen.
It wuz so droel! for when we wer shut in by th wuuden apron, th
man droev so fast that Flo wuz frietend, and toeld me to stop him.
But he wuz up outsied behind sumwhaer, and I couldn't get at him.
He didn't heer me call, nor see me flap mi parasol in frunt, and
thaer we wer, qiet helples, ratling away, and whurling around corners
at a braek-nek paess. At last, in mi despaer, I saw a litl dor
in th roof, and on poeking it oepen, a red ie apeerd, and a beery
vois sed,—</p>

<p>"'Now then, mum?'</p>

<p>"I gaev mi order as soeberly as I cuud, and slaming doun th
dor, with an 'Aye, aye, mum,' th man maed his horss wauk, as if
going to a fueneral. I poekt again, and sed, 'A litl faster;' then off
he went, helter-skelter, as befor, and we reziend ourselvs to our faet.</p>

<p>"To-dae wuz faer and we went to Hyde Park, cloez by, for we ar
mor aristocratic than we luuk. Th Duek of Devonshire lievs neer.
I ofen see his fuutmen lounging at th bak gaet; and th Duek of
Wellington's hous is not far off. Such siets as I saw, mi deer! It
wuz as guud as Punch, for thaer wer fat dowagers roeling about in
thaer red and yelo coeches, with gorjus Jeameses in silk stokings
and velvet coets, up behind, and pouderd coachmen in frunt.
Smart maeds, with th roezyest children I ever saw; handsum gurls,
luuking haf asleep; dandies, in qeer English hats and lavender kid,
lounging about, and taul soeljers, in short red jakets and mufin caps
stuk on wun sied, luuking so funy I longed to skech them.</p>

<p>"Roten Row (noun) means '<i>Root de Roi</i>,' or th king's wae; but now
it's mor liek a rieding-scool than anything else. Th horses ar
splendid, and th men, especially th grooms, ried wel; but th wimen
ar stif, and bounss, which isn't acording to our rools. I longed
to sho them a teering American galop, for thae trotted solemly up
and doun, in thaer scant habits and hie hats, luuking liek th wimen
<span class="pagenum2">382</span>
in a toy Noah's Ark. Every wun rieds,—oeld men, stout laedys, litl
children,—and th yung foeks do a deel of flurting heer; I saw a paer
exchange roezbuds, for it's th thing to waer wun in th buton-hoel,
and I thaut it rather a niess litl iedeea.</p>

<p>"In th <span class="smc">p.m.</span> 
to Westminster Aby; but don't expect me to descrieb
it, that's imposibl—so I'll oenly sae it wuz subliem! This
evening we ar going to see Fechter, which wil be an aproepriat
end to th hapyest dae of mi lief.</p>

<p>"It's verry laet, but I can't let mi leter go in th morning without
teling U whut happened last evening. Hoo do U think caem in,
as we wer at tee? Laurie's English frends, Fred and Frank Vaughn!
I wuz <em>so</em> serpriezd, for I shouldn't hav noen them but for th cards.
Boeth ar taul feloes, with whiskers; Fred handsum in th English
stiel, and Frank much beter, for he oenly limps slietly, and uezes no
cruches. Thae had hurd from Laurie whaer we wer to be, and
caem to ask us to thaer hous; but unkl wun't go, so we shal return
th call, and see them as we can. Thae went to th theeater with us,
and we did hav <em>such</em> a guud tiem, for Frank devoeted himself to Flo,
and Fred and I taukt oever past, prezent, and fuecher fun as if we had
noen eech uther all our daes. Tel Beth Frank askt for her, and
wuz sorry to heer of her il helth. Fred laft when I spoek of Jo,
and sent his 'respektful compliments to th big hat.' Neether of
them had forgoten Camp Laurence, or th fun we had thaer. Whut
aejes ago it seems, doesn't it?</p>

<p>"Ant is taping on th waul for th thurd tiem, so I <em>must</em> stop.
I reealy feel liek a dissipated London fien laedy, rieting heer so laet,
with mi room fuul of prity things, and mi hed a jumbl of parks,
theeaters, nue gouns, and galant creechers hoo sae 'Ah!' and twirl thaer

"In mi last I toeld U about our London vizit,—how kiend th
Vaughns wer, and whut plezant partys thae maed for us. I enjoyd
th trips to Hampton Cort and th Kensington Muezeeum
<span class="pagenum2">383</span>
mor than anything else,—for at Hampton I saw Raphael's cartoons,
and, at th Muezeeum, rooms fuul of pikchers by Turner, Lawrence,
Reynolds, Hogarth, and th uther graet creechers. Th dae
in Richmond Park wuz charming, for we had a reguelar English
picnic, and I had mor splendid oeks and groops of deer than I
cuud copy; aulso hurd a nietinggael, and saw larks go up. We 'did'
London to our harts' content, thanks to Fred and Frank, and wer
sorry to go away; for, tho English peepl ar slo to taek U in,
when thae wunss maek up thaer miends to do it thae cannot be outdun
in hospitality, <em>I</em> think. Th Vaughns hoep to meet us in Rome next
winter, and I shal be dredfuly disapointed if thae don't, for Graess

Fred.</p>

<p>"Wel, we wer hardly setld heer, when he turnd up again, saeing
he had cum for a holidae, and wuz going to Switzerland. Ant

speeks French liek a naetiv, and I don't noe whut we should do
without him. Unkl doesn't noe ten wurds, and insists on tauking
English verry loud, as if that wuud maek peepl understand him.
Ant's pronunciation is oeld-fashond, and Flo and I, tho we flaterd
ourselvs that we knew a guud deel, fiend we don't, and ar
verry graetful to hav Fred do th '<i>parley vooing</i>,' as unkl calls it.</p>

<p>"Such delietful times as we ar having! siet-seeing from morning

noez at sum of th fienest, because she has no soel for art; but 
<em>I</em> hav, and I'm cultivaeting ie and taest as fast as I can. 
She wuud liek th reliks of graet peepl beter, for I've seen her 
Napoleon's cokt hat and grae coet, his baeby's craedl and his oeld

"Having a qieet our befor we leev for Berne, I'll tri to tel
U whut has happened, for sum of it is verry important, as U wil
see.</p>

<p>"Th sael up th Rhine wuz perfect, and I just sat and enjoyd it
with all mi miet. Get faather's oeld gied-books, and red about it;
I haeven't wurds buetiful enough to descrieb it. At Coblentz we had
a luvly tiem, for sum stoodents from Bonn, with hoom Fred got aqaented
on th boet, gaev us a serenaed. It wuz a moonliet niet,
and, about wun o'clok, Flo and I wer waekt by th moest delicious
muezik under our windoes. We floo up, and hid behind th curtens;
but sli peeps shoed us Fred and th stoodents singing away doun
beloe. It wuz th moest roemantik thing I ever saw,—th river, th
bridge of boets, th graet fortres opozit, moonliet everywhaer,
and muezik fit to melt a hart of stoen.</p>

<p>"When thae wer dun we throo doun sum flowers, and saw them
scrambl for them, kis thaer hands to th invizibl laedys, and go
lafing away,—to smoek and drink beer, I supoez. Next morning
Fred shoed me wun of th crumpld flowers in his vest-poket,
and luukt verry sentimental. I laft at him, and sed I didn't
thro it, but Flo, which seemd to disgust him, for he tost it out of
th windo, and turnd sensibl again. I'm afraed I'm going to hav
trubl with that boy, it begins to luuk liek it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">386</span>
"Th baths at Nassau wer verry gae, so wuz Baden-Baden, whaer
Fred lost sum muny, and I scoelded him. He needs sum wun to
luuk after him when Frank is not with him. Kate sed wunss she
hoept he'd marry soon, and I qiet agree with her that it wuud be
wel for him. Frankfort wuz delietful; I saw Goethe's hous, Schiller's
stachoo, and Dannecker's faemus 'Ariadne.' It wuz verry luvly,
but I should hav enjoyd it mor if I had noen th story beter.
I didn't liek to ask, as every wun knew it, or pretended thae did. I
wish Jo wuud tel me all about it; I aut to hav red mor, for
I fiend I don't noe anything, and it mortifies me.</p>

<p>"Now cums th seerius part,—for it happened heer, and Fred is
just gon. He has been so kiend and joly that we all got qiet fond
of him; I never thaut of anything but a travelling frendship, till
th serenaed niet. Sinss then I've begun to feel that th moonliet
wauks, balcony tauks, and daily advenchers wer sumthing mor
to him than fun. I haeven't flurted, muther, truly, but rememberd
whut U sed to me, and hav dun mi verry best. I can't help it if
peepl liek me; I don't tri to maek them, and it wurys me if I
don't caer for them, tho Jo sez I haeven't got any hart. Now
I noe muther wil shaek her hed, and th gurls sae, 'O, th mursenaery
litl rech!' but I've maed up mi miend, and, if Fred asks
me, I shal accept him, tho I'm not madly in luv. I liek him,
and we get on comfortably together. He is handsum, yung, clever
enough, and verry rich,—ever so much richer than th Laurences.
I don't think his family wuud objekt, and I should be verry hapy,
for thae ar all kiend, wel-bred, jenerus peepl, and thae liek me.
Fred, as th eldest twin, wil hav th estate, I supoez, and such a
splendid wun as it is! A sity hous in a fashonabl street, not so
shoey as our big houses, but twice as comfortable, and fuul of solid
lukshery, such as English peepl beleev in. I liek it, for it's jenuein.
I've seen th plaet, th family jooels, th oeld survants, and pikchers
of th cuntry plaess, with its park, graet hous, luvly grounds, and
fien horses. O, it wuud be all I should ask! and I'd rather hav
it than any tietl such as gurls snap up so redily, and fiend nuthing behind.
I mae be mursenaery, but I haet poverty, and don't meen to
baer it a mienuet longer than I can help. Wun of us <em>must</em> marry wel;
<span class="pagenum2">387</span>
Meg didn't, Jo wun't, Beth can't yet, so I shal, and maek everything
cosey all round. I wouldn't marry a man I haeted or despiezd. U
mae be shuur of that; and, tho Fred is not mi model heero, he
duz verry wel, and, in tiem, I should get fond enough of him if he
wuz verry fond of me, and let me do just as I liked. So I've been
turning th mater oever in mi miend th last week, for it wuz imposibl
to help seeing that Fred liked me. He sed nuthing, but litl
things shoed it; he never goes with Flo, aulwaes gets on mi sied of
th carrej, taebl, or promenade, luuks sentimental when we ar
aloen, and frouns at any wun else hoo ventures to speek to me. Yesterdae,
at diner, when an Austrian
ofiser staerd at us, and then sed
sumthing to his frend,—a raekish-luuking
baron,—about '<i>ein wonderschönes
Blöndchen</i>,' Fred luukt
as feerss as a lieon, and cut his meet
so savejly, it neerly floo off his
plaet. He isn't wun of th cool, stif
Englishmen, but is rather pepery,
for he has Scotch blud in him, as
wun miet ges from his bonnie
bloo ies.</p>

<p>"Wel, last evening we went up to
th casl about sunset,—at leest
all of us but Fred, hoo wuz to meet
us thaer, after going to th Poest Restante
for leters. We had a charming
tiem poeking about th rooins, th
vaults whaer th monster tun is, and
th buetiful gardens maed by th elector, long ago, for his English
wief. I liked th graet terris best, for th vue wuz divine; so,
whiel th rest went to see th rooms insied, I sat thaer trieing to
skech th grae stoen lieon's hed on th waul, with scarlet wuudbien
spraes hanging round it. I felt as if I'd got into a roemanss, sitting
thaer, woching th Neckar roeling thru th valy, lisening to th
muezik of th Austrian band beloe, and waeting for mi luver, liek a
<span class="pagenum2">388</span>
reeal story-book gurl. I had a feeling that sumthing wuz going to
hapen, and I wuz redy for it. I didn't feel blushy or quakey, but
qiet cool, and oenly a litl exsieted.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"By and by I hurd Fred's vois, and then he caem hurying
thru th graet arch to fiend me. He luukt so trubld that I
forgot all about mieself, and askt whut th mater wuz. He sed
he'd just got a leter beging him to cum hoem, for Frank wuz verry
il; so he wuz going at wunss, in th niet traen, and oenly had tiem to
sae guud-by. I wuz verry sorry for him, and disapointed for mieself,
but oenly for a mienuet, because he sed, as he shuuk hands,—and
sed it in a wae that I cuud not mistaek,—'I shal soon
cum bak; U wun't forget me, Amy?'</p>

<p>"I didn't promis, but I luukt at him, and he seemd satisfied,
and thaer wuz no tiem for anything but mesejes and guud-byes, for
he wuz off in an our, and we all mis him verry much. I noe he
wontedw to speek, but I think, from sumthing he wunss hinted, that
he had promist his faather not to do anything of th sort yet awhile,
for he is a rash boy, and th oeld jentlman dreds a forin dauter-in-law.
We shal soon meet in Rome; and then, if I don't chaenj
mi miend, I'll sae 'Yes, thank U,' when he sez 'Wil U, pleez?'</p>

<p>"Of corss this is all <em>verry private</em>, but I wisht U to noe whut
wuz going on. Don't be anxious about me; remember I am yuur
'proodent Amy,' and be shuur I wil do nuthing rashly. Send me as
much advice as U liek; I'll uez it if I can. I wish I cuud see U
for a guud tauk, Marmee. Luv and trust me.</p>

<p class="h2a">TENDER Trubls.</p>

<p>"<span class="smc">Jo</span>, I'm anxious about Beth."</p>

<p>"Whi, muther, she has seemd unuezhualy wel sinss th baebys
caem."</p>

<p>"It's not her helth that trubls me now; it's her spirits. I'm
shuur thaer is sumthing on her miend, and I wont U to discuver
whut it is."</p>

<p>"Whut maeks U think so, muther?"</p>

<p>"She sits aloen a guud deel, and doesn't tauk to her faather as much
as she uezd. I found her crieing oever th baebys th uther dae.
When she sings, th songs ar aulwaes sad wuns, and now and then I
see a luuk in her faess that I don't understand. This isn't liek Beth,
and it wurys me."</p>

<p>"Hav U askt her about it?"</p>

<p>"I hav tried wunss or twice; but she eether evaeded mi qeschons,
or luukt so distressed that I stopt. I never forss mi children's
confidenss, and I seldom hav to waet for it long."</p>

<p>Mrs. March glanst at Jo as she spoek, but th faess opozit
seemd qiet unconshus of any seecret disquietude but Beth's; and,
after soeing thautfuly for a mienuet, Jo sed,—</p>

<p>"I think she is groeing up, and so begins to dreem dreems, and
hav hoeps and feers and fijets, without noeing whi, or being
aebl to explaen them. Whi, muther, Beth's aeteen, but we don't
reealiez it, and treat her liek a chield, forgeting she's a wuuman."</p>

<p>"So she is. Deer hart, how fast U do gro up," returnd her
muther, with a sie and a smiel.</p>

<p>"
<span class="pagenum2">390</span>
Can't be helpt, Marmee, so U must rezien yuurself to all sorts
of wurys, and let yuur burds hop out of th nest, wun by wun. I
promis never to hop verry far, if that is any cumfort to U."</p>

<p>"It is a graet cumfort, Jo; I aulwaes feel strong when U ar at
hoem, now Meg is gon. Beth is too feebl and Amy too yung to
depend upon; but when th tug cums, U ar aulwaes redy."</p>

<p>"Whi, U noe I don't miend hard jobs much, and thaer must
aulwaes be wun scrub in a family. Amy is splendid in fien wurks, and
I'm not; but I feel in mi element when all th carpets ar to be
taeken up, or haf th family faul sik at wunss. Amy is distingwishing
herself abraud; but if anything is amis at hoem, I'm yuur
man."</p>

<p>"I leev Beth to yuur hands, then, for she wil oepen her tender
litl hart to her Jo sooner than to any wun else. Be verry kiend, and
don't let her think any wun woches or tauks about her. If she oenly
wuud get qiet strong and cheerful again, I shouldn't hav a wish in
th wurld."</p>

<p>"Hapy wuuman! I've got heeps."</p>

<p>"Mi deer, whut ar thae?"</p>

<p>"I'll setl Bethy's trubls, and then I'll tel U mien. Thae
ar not verry waering, so thae'll keep;" and Jo stitched away, with a
wiez nod which set her muther's hart at rest about her, for th prezent
at leest.</p>

<p>Whiel apparently absorbd in her oen affairs, Jo wocht Beth;
and, after meny conflikting conjectures, fienaly setld upon wun which
seemd to explaen th chaenj in her. A sliet insident gaev Jo th
cloo to th mistery, she thaut, and lievly fansy, luving hart did
th rest. She wuz affecting to riet busily wun Saturday afternoon,
when she and Beth wer aloen together; yet as she scribld, she
kept her ie on her sister, hoo seemd unuezhualy qieet. Sitting at
th windo, Beth's wurk ofen dropt into her lap, and she leend
her hed upon her hand, in a dejekted atitued, whiel her ies rested
on th dul, autumnal landscaep. Sudenly sum wun past beloe,
whisling liek an operatik blakburd, and a vois called out,—</p>

</div>

<p>"All sereen! Cuming in to-niet."</p>

<p>Beth started, leend forward, smield and noded, wocht th
<span class="pagenum2">391</span>
passer-by till his qik tramp died away, then sed softly, as if to herself,—</p>

<p>"How strong and wel and hapy that deer boy luuks."</p>

<p>"Hum!" sed Jo, still intent upon her sister's faess; for th briet
culor faeded as qikly as it caem, th smiel vanisht, and prezently
a teer lae shiening on th windo-ledge. Beth whiskt it off, and
glanst aprehensivly at Jo; but she wuz scraching away at a tremendous
raet, apparently engroest in "Olympia's Oeth." Th instant
Beth turnd, Jo began her woch again, saw Beth's hand go
qieetly to her ies mor than wunss, and, in her haf-avurted faess,
red a tender sorro that maed her oen ies fil. Feering to betrae
herself, she slipt away, murmering sumthing about needing mor
paeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">392</span>
"Mursy on me, Beth luvs Laurie!" she sed, sitting doun in her
oen room, pale with th shok of th discuvery which she beleevd
she had just maed. "I never drempt of such a thing. Whut <em>wil</em>
muther sae? I wunder if he—" thaer Jo stopt, and turnd scarlet
with a suden thaut. "If he shouldn't luv bak again, how
dredful it wuud be. He must; I'll maek him!" and she shuuk her
hed threteningly at th pikcher of th mischivus-luuking boy
lafing at her from th waul. "O deer, we <em>ar</em> groeing up with a
venjenss. Heer's Meg marryd and a maama, Amy flurishing
away at Paris, and Beth in luv. I'm th oenly wun that has senss
enough to keep out of mischif." Jo thaut intently for a mienuet,
with her ies fixed on th pikcher; then she smoothd out her rinkld
forhed, and sed, with a desieded nod at th faess opozit,
"No, thank U, sur; U're verry charming, but U've no mor stability
than a wethercok; so U needn't riet tuching noets, and
smiel in that insinueaeting wae, for it wun't do a bit of guud, and I
wun't hav it."</p>

<p>Then she sighed, and fel into a reverie, from which she did not
waek till th eerly twilight sent her doun to taek nue obzervaeshons,
which oenly confurmd her suspishon. Tho Laurie flurted with
Amy and joekt with Jo, his maner to Beth had aulwaes been peculiarly
kiend and jentl, but so wuz everybody's; thaerfor, no wun
thaut of imajining that he caerd mor for her than for th others.
Indeed, a jeneral impreshon had prevaeld in th family, of laet, that
"our boy" wuz geting fonder than ever of Jo, hoo, however, wouldn't
heer a wurd upon th subjekt, and scoelded vieolently if any wun dared
to sugjest it. If thae had noen th vaerius tender pasejes of th
past yeer, or rather atempts at tender pasejes which had been
nipt in th bud, thae wuud hav had th imenss satisfakshon of
saeing, "I toeld U so." But Jo haeted "philandering," and wouldn't
alow it, aulwaes having a joek or a smiel redy at th leest sien of impending
daenjer.</p>

<p>When Laurie furst went to colej, he fel in luv about wunss a
munth; but thees small flaems wer as brief as ardent, did no damej,
and much amuezd Jo, hoo tuuk graet interest in th aulternaeshons
of hoep, despaer, and rezignaeshon, which wer confieded to her in
<span class="pagenum2">393</span>
thaer weekly conferences. But thaer caem a tiem when Laurie seest
to wurship at meny shriens, hinted darkly at wun all-absorbing pashon,
and induljd ocaezhonaly in Byronic fits of gloom. Then he
avoided th tender subjekt aultogether, roet philosophical noets to
Jo, turnd stoodius, and gaev out that he wuz going to "dig," intending
to grajuaet in a blaez of glory. This suited th yung laedy
beter than twilight confidenses, tender preshers of th hand, and
eloquent glanses of th ie; for with Jo, braen developt urlyer than
hart, and she prefurd imajinarry heroes to reeal wuns, because,
when tierd of them, th former cuud be shut up in th tin-kichen
till called for, and th later wer les manejabl.</p>

<p>Things wer in this staet when th grand discuvery wuz maed, and
Jo wocht Laurie that niet as she had never dun befor. If she
had not got th nue iedeea into her hed, she wuud hav seen nuthing
uenuezhual in th fakt that Beth wuz verry qieet, and Laurie verry kiend
to her. But having given th raen to her lievly fansy, it galopt
away with her at a graet paess; and common senss, being rather
weekend by a long corss of roemanss rieting, did not cum to th
rescue. As uezhual, Beth lae on th soefa, and Laurie sat in a loe chaer
cloez by, amuezing her with all sorts of gosip; for she depended on
her weekly "spin," and he never disapointed her. But that evening,
Jo fansyd that Beth's ies rested on th lievly, dark faess besied
her with peculiar plezher, and that she lisend with intenss interest
to an account of sum exsieting criket-mach, tho th phrases,
"caut off a tice," "stumpt off his ground," and "th leg hit for
three," wer as intelijibl to her as Sanscrit. She aulso fansyd, having
set her hart upon seeing it, that she saw a surten increess of
jentlnes in Laurie's maner, that he dropt his vois now and then,
laft les than uezhual, wuz a litl absent-miended, and setld th
afghan oever Beth's feet with an assiduity that wuz reealy aulmoest tender.</p>

<p>"Hoo noes? straenjer things hav happened," thaut Jo, as she
fust about th room. "She wil maek qiet an aenjel of him, and
he wil maek lief delietfuly eezy and plezant for th deer, if thae
oenly luv eech uther. I don't see how he can help it; and I do beleev
he wuud if th rest of us wer out of th wae."</p>

<p>As every wun <em>wuz</em> out of th wae but herself, Jo began to feel that
<span class="pagenum2">394</span>
she aut to dispoez of herself with all speed. But whaer should she
go? and burning to lae herself upon th shrien of sisterly devoeshon,
she sat doun to setl that pointer.</p>

<p>Now, th oeld soefa wuz a reguelar patriarch of a soefa,—long, braud,
wel-cuushond, and loe; a trifle shaby, as wel it miet be, for th
gurls had slept and sprawled on it as baebys, fished oever th bak,
roed on th arms, and had menajerys under it as children, and
rested tierd heds, dreemd dreems, and lisend to tender tauk on
it as yung wimen. Thae all luvd it, for it wuz a family refuej,
and wun corner had aulwaes been Jo's faevorit lounging-plaess. Amung
th meny piloes that adornd th venerable couch wuz wun, hard,
round, cuverd with prickly hors-haer, and furnisht with a noby
buton at eech end; this repulsiv pilo wuz her especial property,
being uezd as a wepon of defence, a barricade, or a sturn preventive
of too much slumber.</p>

<p>Laurie knew this pilo wel, and had cauz to regard it with deep
avurzhon, having been unmercifully pummelled with it in former daes,
when romping wuz alowd, and now freeqently debard by it from
taeking th seet he moest cuveted, next to Jo in th soefa corner. If
"th sausej" as thae called it, stuud on end, it wuz a sien that he
miet approach and repoez; but if it lae flat acros th soefa, wo to
th man, wuuman, or chield hoo dared disturb it! That evening Jo
forgot to barricade her corner, and had not been in her seet fiev minits,
befor a masiv form apeerd besied her, and, with boeth arms
spred oever th soefa-bak, boeth long legs strecht out befor him,
Laurie exclaemd, with a sie of satisfakshon,—</p>

<p>"Now, <em>this</em> is filing at th priess."</p>

</div>

<p>"No slang," snapt Jo, slaming doun th pilo. But it wuz
too laet, thaer wuz no room for it; and, coesting on to th flor, it
disapeerd in a moest misteerius maner.</p>

<p>"Cum, Jo, don't be thorny. After studying himself to a skeleton
all th week, a felo dezurvs peting, and aut to get it."</p>

<p>"Beth wil pet U; I'm busy."</p>

<p>"No, she's not to be botherd with me; but U liek that sort of
thing, unles U've sudenly lost yuur taest for it. Hav U?
Do U haet yuur boy, and wont to fier piloes at him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">395</span>
Anything mor wheedlesome than that tuching apeel wuz seldom
hurd, but Jo qencht "her boy" by turning on him with th sturn
qeery,—</p>

<p>"How meny bouquets hav U sent Mis Randal this week?"</p>

<p>"Not wun, upon mi wurd. She's engaejd. Now then."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it; that's wun of yuur foolish extravagances,—sending
flowers and things to gurls for hoom U don't caer too pins," continued
Jo reproovingly.</p>

<p>"Sensibl gurls, for hoom I do caer hoel paepers of pins, wun't
let me send them 'flowers and things,' so whut can I do? Mi
feelings must hav a <em>went</em>."</p>

<p>"Muther doesn't aproov of flurting, eeven in fun; and U do flurt
desperatly, Teddy."</p>

<p>"I'd giv anything if I cuud anser, 'So do U.' As I can't,
I'll meerly sae that I don't see any harm in that plezant litl gaem,
if all partys understand that it's oenly plae."</p>

<p>"Wel, it duz luuk plezant, but I can't lurn how it's dun. I've
tried, because wun feels aukward in company, not to do as everybody
else is dooing; but I don't seem to get on," sed Jo, forgeting to plae
Mentor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">396</span>
"Taek lesons of Amy; she has a reguelar talent for it."</p>

<p>"Yes, she duz it verry pritily, and never seems to go too far. I
supoez it's nacheral to sum peepl to pleez without trieing, and
others to aulwaes sae and do th rong thing in th rong plaess."</p>

<p>"I'm glad U can't flurt; it's reealy refreshing to see a sensibl,
straetforward gurl, hoo can be joly and kiend without maeking a fool
of herself. Between ourselvs, Jo, sum of th gurls I noe reealy do
go on at such a raet I'm ashamed of them. Thae don't meen any
harm, I'm shuur; but if thae knew how we feloes taukt about them
afterward, thae'd mend thaer waes, I fansy."</p>

<p>"Thae do th saem; and, as thaer tungs ar th sharpest, U
feloes get th wurst of it, for U ar as sily as thae, every bit. If
U behaevd properly, thae wuud; but, noeing U liek thaer nonsenss,
thae keep it up, and then U blaem them."</p>

<p>"Much U noe about it, maa'am," sed Laurie, in a superior toen.
"We don't liek romps and flurts, tho we mae akt as if we did
sumtiems. Th prity, modest gurls ar never taukt about, exsept
respektfuly, amung jentlmen. Bles yuur inosent soel! If U
cuud be in mi plaess for a munth U'd see things that wuud astonish
U a trifle. Upon mi wurd, when I see wun of thoes harum-scarum
gurls, I aulwaes wont to sae with our frend Cok Robin,—</p>

<div class="poem1">
<p class="indent30 left-indent15">
   "'Out upon U, fie upon U,</p>
<p class="indent25 left-indent15">
      Boeld-faest jig!'"</p>
</div>

<p>It wuz imposibl to help lafing at th funy conflikt between
Laurie's chivalrous reluktanss to speek il of wuumankiend, and his
verry nacheral disliek of th unfeminine foly of which fashonabl soesieety
shoed him meny sampls. Jo knew that "yung Laurence"
wuz regarded as a moest eligible <i>parti</i> by wurldly maamas, wuz much
smield upon by thaer dauters, and flaterd enough by laedys of all
aejes to maek a coxcomb of him; so she wocht him rather jealously,
feering he wuud be spoilt, and rejoist mor than she confest
to fiend that he still beleevd in modest gurls. Returning
sudenly to her admonitory toen, she sed, droping her vois, "If
U <em>must</em> hav a 'went,' Teddy, go and devoet yuurself to wun of th
'prity, modest gurls' hoom U do respekt, and not waest yuur tiem
with th sily wuns."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">397</span>
"U reealy advise it?" and Laurie luukt at her with an od
mixcher of anxiety and merriment in his faess.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do; but U'd beter waet till U ar thru colej, on
th hoel, and be fitting yuurself for th plaess meentiem. U're
not haf guud enough for—wel, hooever th modest gurl mae be,"
and Jo luukt a litl qeer liekwiez, for a naem had aulmoest escaept
her.</p>

<p>"That I'm not!" aqi’est Laurie, with an expreshon of huemility
qiet nue to him, as he dropt his ies, and absently woond
Jo's apron-tasel round his fingger.</p>

<p>"Mursy on us, this wil never do," thaut Jo; ading aloud,
"Go and sing to me. I'm dieing for sum muezik, and aulwaes liek
yuurs."</p>

<p>"I'd rather stae heer, thank U."</p>

<p>"Wel, U can't; thaer isn't room. Go and maek yuurself uesful,
sinss U ar too big to be ornamental. I thaut U haeted to be
tied to a wuuman's apron-string?" retorted Jo, qoeting surten rebelyus
wurds of his oen.</p>

<p>"Ah, that depends on hoo waers th apron!" and Laurie gaev an
audaeshus tweak at th tasel.</p>

<p>"Ar U going?" demanded Jo, diving for th pilo.</p>

<p>He fled at wunss, and th mienuet it wuz wel "Up with th bonnets
of bonnie Dundee," she slipt away, to return no mor till th
yung jentlman had departed in hie dujon.</p>

</div>

<p>Jo lae long awake that niet, and wuz just droping off when th
sound of a stifled sob maed her fli to Beth's bedside, with th anxious
inqiery, "Whut is it, deer?"</p>

<p>"I thaut U wer asleep," sobd Beth.</p>

<p>"Is it th oeld paen, mi precious?"</p>

<p>"No; it's a nue wun; but I can baer it," and Beth tried to chek
her teers.</p>

<p>"Tel me all about it, and let me cuer it as I ofen did th uther."</p>

<p>"U can't; thaer is no cuer." Thaer Beth's vois gaev wae,
and, clinging to her sister, she cried so despaeringly that Jo wuz
frietend.</p>

<p>"Whaer is it? Shal I call muther?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">398</span>
Beth did not anser th furst qeschon; but in th dark wun hand
went involuntarrily to her hart, as if th paen wer thaer; with th
uther she held Jo fast, whispering eegerly, "No, no, don't call her,
don't tel her. I shal be beter soon. Lie doun heer and 'puur'
mi hed. I'll be qieet, and go to sleep; indeed I wil."</p>

<p>Jo oebaed; but as her hand went softly to and fro acros Beth's
hot forhed and wet ielids, her hart wuz verry fuul, and she longed
to speek. But yung as she wuz, Jo had lurnd that harts, liek
flowers, cannot be roodly handld, but must oepen nacheraly; so,
tho she beleevd she knew th cauz of Beth's nue paen, she oenly
sed, in her tenderest toen, "Duz anything trubl U, deary?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">399</span>
"Yes, Jo," after a long pause.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it cumfort U to tel me whut it is?"</p>

<p>"Not now, not yet."</p>

<p>"Then I wun't ask; but remember, Bethy, that muther and Jo ar
aulwaes glad to heer and help U, if thae can."</p>

<p>"I noe it. I'll tel U by and by."</p>

<p>"Is th paen beter now?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, much beter; U ar so comfortable, Jo!"</p>

<p>"Go to sleep, deer; I'll stae with U."</p>

<p>So cheek to cheek thae fel asleep, and on th morro Beth seemd
qiet herself again; for at aeteen, neether heds nor harts aek
long, and a luving wurd can medisin moest ils.</p>

<p>But Jo had maed up her miend, and, after pondering oever a projekt
for sum daes, she confieded it to her muther.</p>

<p>"U askt me th uther dae whut mi wishes wer. I'll tel U
wun of them, Marmee," she began, as thae sat aloen together. "I
wont to go away sumwhaer this winter for a chaenj."</p>

<p>"Whi, Jo?" and her muther luukt up qikly, as if th wurds
sugjested a dubl meening.</p>

<p>With her ies on her wurk, Jo anserd soeberly, "I wont sumthing
nue; I feel restles, and anxious to be seeing, dooing, and lurning
mor than I am. I brood too much oever mi oen small affairs,
and need sturing up, so, as I can be spaerd this winter, I'd liek to
hop a litl wae, and tri mi wings."</p>

<p>"Whaer wil U hop?"</p>

<p>"To Nue York. I had a briet iedeea yesterdae, and this is it.
U noe Mrs. Kirke roet to U for sum respektabl yung purson

thing, but I think I should suit if I tried."</p>

<p>"Mi deer, go out to survis in that graet boarding-hous!" and
Mrs. March luukt serpriezd, but not displeezd.</p>

<p>"It's not exaktly going out to survis; for Mrs. Kirke is yuur
frend,—th kiendest soel that ever livd,—and wuud maek things
plezant for me, I noe. Her family is separet from th rest, and no
wun noes me thaer. Don't caer if thae do; it's onest wurk, and
I'm not ashamed of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">400</span>
"Nor I; but yuur rieting?"</p>

<p>"All th beter for th chaenj. I shal see and heer nue things,
get nue iedeeas, and, eeven if I haeven't much tiem thaer, I shal bring
hoem qontitys of mateerial for mi rubish."</p>

<p>"I hav no dout of it; but ar thees yuur oenly reezons for this
suden fansy?"</p>

<p>"No, muther."</p>

<p>"Mae I noe th others?"</p>

<p>Jo luukt up and Jo luukt doun, then sed sloely, with suden
culor in her cheeks, "It mae be vaen and rong to sae it, but—I'm
afraed—Laurie is geting too fond of me."</p>

<p>"Then U don't caer for him in th wae it is evident he begins
to caer for U?" and Mrs. March luukt anxious as she put th
qeschon.</p>

<p>"Mursy, no! I luv th deer boy, as I aulwaes hav, and am imensly
proud of him; but as for anything mor, it's out of th
qeschon."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that, Jo."</p>

<p>"Whi, pleez?"</p>

<p>"Because, deer, I don't think U suited to wun anuther. As
frends U ar verry hapy, and yuur freeqent qorrels soon blo
oever; but I feer U wuud boeth rebl if U wer maeted for lief.
U ar too much aliek and too fond of freedom, not to menshon hot
tempers and strong wils, to get on hapily together, in a relaeshon which
needs infinit paeshenss and forbaeranss, as wel as luv."</p>

<p>"That's just th feeling I had, tho I couldn't expres it. I'm
glad U think he is oenly begining to caer for me. It wuud trubl
me sadly to maek him unhapy; for I couldn't faul in luv with th
deer oeld felo meerly out of gratitood, cuud I?"</p>

<p>"U ar shuur of his feeling for U?"</p>

<p>Th culor deepend in Jo's cheeks, as she anserd, with th luuk
of minggld plezher, pride, and paen which yung gurls waer when
speeking of furst luvers,—</p>

<p>"I'm afraed it is so, muther; he hasn't sed anything, but he luuks
a graet deel. I think I had beter go away befor it cums to anything."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">401</span>
"I agree with U, and if it can be manejd U shal go."</p>

<p>Jo luukt releevd, and, after a pause, sed, smieling, "How Mrs.
Moffat wuud wunder at yuur wont of manejment, if she knew; and
how she wil rejois that Annie still mae hoep."</p>

<p>"Ah, Jo, muthers mae difer in thaer manejment, but th hoep
is th saem in all,—th dezier to see thaer children hapy. Meg
is so, and I am content with her success. U I leev to enjoy yuur
liberty till U tier of it; for oenly then wil U fiend that thaer is
sumthing sweeter. Amy is mi cheef caer now, but her guud senss
wil help her. For Beth, I indulj no hoeps exsept that she mae be
wel. By th wae, she seems brieter this last dae or too. Hav U
spoeken to her?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she oend she had a trubl, and promist to tel me by
and by. I sed no mor, for I think I noe it;" and Jo toeld her litl
story.</p>

<p>Mrs. March shuuk her hed, and did not taek so roemantik a vue
of th caess, but luukt graev, and repeeted her opinyon that, for
Laurie's saek, Jo should go away for a tiem.</p>

<p>"Let us sae nuthing about it to him till th plan is setld; then
I'll run away befor he can colekt his wits and be tragical. Beth
must think I'm going to pleez mieself, as I am, for I can't tauk about
Laurie to her; but she can pet and cumfort him after I'm gon, and
so cuer him of this roemantik noeshon. He's been thru so meny
litl trieals of th sort, he's uezd to it, and wil soon get oever his luv-lornity."</p>

<p>Jo spoek hoepfuly, but cuud not rid herself of th forboeding feer
that this "litl trieal" wuud be harder than th others, and that Laurie
wuud not get oever his "luv-lornity" as eezily as heertofor.</p>

<p>Th plan wuz taukt oever in a family council, and agreed upon; for
Mrs. Kirke gladly accepted Jo, and promist to maek a plezant
hoem for her. Th teeching wuud render her independent; and
such leezher as she got miet be maed profitabl by rieting, whiel th
nue seens and soesieety wuud be boeth uesful and agreeabl. Jo liked
th prospekt and wuz eeger to be gon, for th hoem-nest wuz groeing
too narro for her restles naechuur and advencherus spirit. When all
wuz setld, with feer and trembling she toeld Laurie; but to her serpriez
<span class="pagenum2">402</span>
he tuuk it verry qieetly. He had been graever than uezhual of laet,
but verry plezant; and, when joekingly accused of turning oever a nue
leef, he anserd soeberly, "So I am; and I meen this wun shal stae
turnd."</p>

<p>Jo wuz verry much releevd that wun of his vurchu’us fits should cum
on just then, and maed her preparaeshons with a lietend hart,—for
Beth seemd mor cheerful,—and hoept she wuz dooing th best
for all.</p>

<p>"Wun thing I leev to yuur especial caer," she sed, th niet
befor she left.</p>

<p>"U meen yuur paepers?" askt Beth.</p>

<p>"No, mi boy. Be verry guud to him, wun't U?"</p>

<p>"Of corss I wil; but I can't fil yuur plaess, and he'll mis U
sadly."</p>

<p>"It wun't hurt him; so remember, I leev him in yuur charj, to
plaeg, pet, and keep in order."</p>

<p>"I'll do mi best, for yuur saek," promist Beth, wundering whi Jo
luukt at her so qeerly.</p>

<p>When Laurie sed "Guud-by," he whisperd significantly, "It
wun't do a bit of guud, Jo. Mi ie is on U; so miend whut U do,
or I'll cum and bring U hoem."</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">"<span class="smc">Nue York</span>, November.</p>

<p class="noindent smc">"Deer Marmee and Beth,—</p>

<p>"I'm going to riet U a reguelar voluem, for I've got heeps to
tel, tho I'm not a fien yung laedy travelling on th continent.
When I lost siet of faather's deer oeld faess, I felt a trifle bloo, and
miet hav shed a brieny drop or too, if an Irish laedy with foer small
children, all crieing mor or les, hadn't divurted mi miend; for I
amuezd mieself by droping jinjerbred nuts oever th seet every tiem
thae oepend thaer mouths to ror.</p>

<p>"Soon th sun caem out, and taeking it as a guud oemen, I cleerd
up liekwiez, and enjoyd mi jurny with all mi hart.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Kirke welcumd me so kiendly I felt at hoem at wunss, eeven
in that big hous fuul of straenjers. She gaev me a funy litl ski-parlor—all
<span class="pagenum2">404</span>
she had; but thaer is a stoev in it, and a niess taebl in a
suny windo, so I can sit heer and riet whenever I liek. A fien
vue and a church-tower opozit atone for th meny staers, and I
tuuk a fansy to mi den on th spot. Th nursery, whaer I am to
teech and soe, is a plezant room next Mrs. Kirke's private parlor,
and th too litl gurls ar prity children,—rather spoilt, I fansy, but
thae tuuk to me after teling them 'Th Seven Bad Pigs;' and I've
no dout I shal maek a model guvernes.</p>

<p>"I am to hav mi meels with th children, if I prefur it to th
graet taebl, and for th prezent I do, for I <em>am</em> bashful, tho no wun
wil beleev it.</p>

<p>"'Now, mi deer, maek yuurself at hoem,' sed Mrs. K. in her
mutherly wae; 'I'm on th driev from morning to niet, as U mae
supoez with such a family; but a graet anxiety wil be off mi miend
if I noe th children ar saef with U. Mi rooms ar aulwaes oepen
to U, and yuur oen shal be as comfortable as I can maek it. Thaer
ar sum plezant peepl in th hous if U feel soeshabl, and yuur
evenings ar aulwaes free. Cum to me if anything goes rong, and
be as hapy as U can. Thaer's th tee-bel; I must run and chaenj
mi cap;' and off she busld, leeving me to setl mieself in mi nue
nest.</p>

<p>"As I went dounstaers, soon after, I saw sumthing I liked. Th
flights ar verry long in this taul hous, and as I stuud waeting at th
hed of th thurd wun for a litl survant gurl to lumber up, I saw a
jentlman cum along behind her, taek th hevy hod of coel out of
her hand, carry it all th wae up, put it doun at a dor neer by, and
wauk away, saeing, with a kiend nod and a forin accent,—</p>

<p>"'It goes beter so. Th litl bak is too yung to haf such
<ins title="period after heaviness."> hevynes.'</ins></p>

<p>"Wasn't it guud of him? I liek such things, for, as faather sez,
trifles sho carrakter. When I menshond it to Mrs. K., that evening,
she laft, and sed,—</p>

<p>"'That must hav been Professor Bhaer; he's aulwaes dooing things
of that sort.'</p>

<p>"Mrs. K. toeld me he wuz from Berlin; verry lurnd and guud, but
puur as a church-mous, and givs lesons to suport himself and too
<span class="pagenum2">405</span>
litl orfan nefues hoom he is ejucaeting heer, acording to th
wishes of his sister, hoo marryd an American. Not a verry roemantik
story, but it interested me; and I wuz glad to heer that Mrs. K. lends
him her parlor for sum of his scolars. Thaer is a glas dor between
it and th nursery, and I meen to peep at him, and then I'll
tel U how he luuks. He's aulmoest forty, so it's no harm, Marmee.</p>

<p>"After tee and a go-to-bed romp with th litl gurls, I attacked
th big wurk-basket, and had a qieet evening chating with mi nue
frend. I shal keep a jurnal-leter, and send it wunss a week; so
guud-niet, and mor to-morro."</p>

<hr class="tiny">

<p class="right">"<i>Tuesday Eve.</i></p>

<p>"Had a lievly tiem in mi seminarry, this morning, for th children
akted liek Sancho; and at wun tiem I reealy thaut I should shaek
them all round. Sum guud aenjel inspired me to tri gymnastics, and
I kept it up till thae wer glad to sit doun and keep still. After lunchon,
th gurl tuuk them out for a wauk, and I went to mi needl-wurk,
liek litl Mabel, 'with a wiling miend.' I wuz thanking mi stars
that I'd lurnd to maek niess buton-hoels, when th parlor-dor
oepend and shut, and sum wun began to hum,—</p>

<p class="center noindent">'Kennst du das land,'</p>

<p class="noindent">
liek a big bumble-bee. It wuz dredfuly improper, I noe, but I
couldn't rezist th temptaeshon; and lifting wun end of th curten
befor th glas dor, I peept in. Professor Bhaer wuz thaer; and
whiel he araenjd his books, I tuuk a guud luuk at him. A reguelar
German,—rather stout, with broun haer tumbld all oever his hed, a
bushy beard, guud noez, th kiendest ies I ever saw, and a splendid
big vois that duz wun's eers guud, after our sharp or slipshod American
gabl. His cloeths wer rusty, his hands wer larj, and he
hadn't a reealy handsum feechuur in his faess, exsept his buetiful
teeth; yet I liked him, for he had a fien hed; his linen wuz verry
niess, and he luukt liek a jentlman, tho too butons wer off his
coet, and thaer wuz a pach on wun shoo. He luukt soeber in spiet
of his huming, till he went to th windo to turn th hieasinth
bulbs tord th sun, and stroek th cat, hoo reseevd him liek an
oeld frend. Then he smield; and when a tap caem at th dor,
called out in a loud, brisk toen,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">406</span>
"'Herein!'</p>

<p>"I wuz just going to run, when I caut siet of a morsel
of a chield carrying a big book, and stopt to see whut wuz
going on.</p>

<p>"'Me wonts mi Bhaer,' sed th miet, slaming doun her book,
and runing to meet him.</p>

</div>

<blockquote>
<p>"'Thow shalt haf thi Bhaer; cum, then, and taek a goot hug
from him, mi Tina,' sed th Professor, caching her up, with a laf,
and hoelding her so hie oever
his hed that she had to
stoop her litl faess to kis
him.</p>

<p>"'Now me mus tuddy mi
lessin,' went on th funy
litl thing; so he put her up
at th taebl, oepend th
graet dikshonaery she had
brought, and gaev her a paeper
and pensil, and she scribld
away, turning a leef now
and then, and pasing her
litl fat fingger doun th
paej, as if fiending a wurd,
so soeberly that I neerly betraed
mieself by a laf,
whiel Mr. Bhaer stuud stroeking
her prity haer, with a
faatherly luuk, that maed me
think she must be his oen,
tho she luukt mor
French than German.</p>

<p>"Anuther nok and th
apeeranss of too yung laedys
sent me bak to mi wurk, and thaer I vurchu’usly remaend
thru all th noiz and gabling that went on next dor. Wun of
th gurls kept lafing affectedly, and saeing 'Now Professor,' in a
<span class="pagenum2">407</span>
coquettish toen, and th uther pronounced her German with an
accent that must hav maed it hard for him to keep soeber.</p>

<p>"Boeth seemd to tri his paeshenss sorly; for mor than wunss I
hurd him sae emfatikaly, 'No, no, it is <em>not</em> so; U haf not atend
to whut I sae;' and wunss thaer wuz a loud rap, as if he struk th
taebl with his book, foloed by th despaering exclamation, 'Prut!
it all goes bad this dae.'</p>

<p>"Puur man, I pityd him; and when th gurls wer gon, tuuk
just wun mor peep, to see if he servievd it. He seemd to hav
throen himself bak in his chaer, tierd out, and sat thaer with his
ies shut till th clok struk too, when he jumpt up, put his
books in his poket, as if redy for anuther leson, and, taeking litl
Tina, hoo had faulen asleep on th soefa, in his arms, he carried her
qieetly away. I fansy he has a hard lief of it.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Kirke askt me if I wouldn't go doun to th fiev o'clok
diner; and, feeling a litl bit hoemsik, I thaut I wuud, just to
see whut sort of peepl ar under th saem roof with me. So I maed
mieself respektabl, and tried to slip in behind Mrs. Kirke; but as
she is short, and I'm taul, mi eforts at concealment wer rather a
faeluer. She gaev me a seet by her, and after mi faess coold off, I
plukt up curej, and luukt about me. Th long taebl wuz fuul,
and every wun intent on geting thaer diner,—th jentlmen especially,
hoo seemd to be eating on tiem, for thae <em>bolted</em> in every senss
of th wurd, vanishing as soon as thae wer dun. Thaer wuz th
uezhual assortment of yung men absorbd in themselvs; yung
cupls absorbd in eech uther; marryd laedys in thaer baebys, and
oeld jentlmen in politiks. I don't think I shal caer to hav much
to do with any of them, exsept wun sweet-faest maeden laedy, hoo
luuks as if she had sumthing in her.</p>

<p>"Cast away at th verry bottom of th taebl wuz th Professor,
shouting ansers to th qeschons of a verry inqizitiv, def oeld jentlman
on wun sied, and tauking philosophy with a Frenchman on th
uther. If Amy had been heer, she'd hav turnd her bak on him
forever, because, sad to relaet, he had a graet apetiet, and shovelled
in his diner in a maner which wuud hav horrified 'her ladyship.'
I didn't miend, for I liek 'to see foeks eat with a relish,' as Hannah
<span class="pagenum2">408</span>
sez, and th puur man must hav needed a deel of food after
teeching idiots all dae.</p>

<p>"As I went upstaers after diner, too of th yung men wer setling
thaer hats befor th haul-miror, and I hurd wun sae loe to th
uther, 'Hoo's th nue party?'</p>

<p>"'Guvernes, or sumthing of that sort.'</p>

<p>"'Whut th deuce is she at our taebl for?'</p>

<p>"'Frend of th oeld laedy's.'</p>

<p>"'Handsum hed, but no stiel.'</p>

<p>"'Not a bit of it. Giv us a liet and cum on.'</p>

<p>"I felt anggry at furst, and then I didn't caer, for a guvernes is as
guud as a clurk, and I've got senss, if I haeven't stiel, which is mor
than sum peepl hav, jujing from th remarks of th elegant
beings hoo claterd away, smoeking liek bad chimnys. I haet ordinaery
peepl!"</p>

<hr class="tiny">

<p class="right">"<i>Thursday.</i></p>

<p>"Yesterdae wuz a qieet dae, spent in teeching, soeing, and rieting
in mi litl room, which is verry cosey, with a liet and fier. I pikt
up a fue bits of nues, and wuz introduest to th Professor. It seems
that Tina is th chield of th Frenchwoman hoo duz th fien ieerning
in th laundry heer. Th litl thing has lost her hart to Mr.
Bhaer, and foloes him about th hous liek a dog whenever he is at
hoem, which deliets him, as he is verry fond of children, tho a
'bacheldore.' Kity and Minnie Kirke liekwiez regard him with
affection, and tel all sorts of storys about th plaes he invents, th
prezents he brings, and th splendid taels he tels. Th yung men
qiz him, it seems, call him Oeld Fritz, Laeger Beer, Ursa Maejor, and
maek all maner of joeks on his naem. But he enjoys it liek a boy,
Mrs. K. sez, and taeks it so guud-naturedly that thae all liek him, in
spiet of his forin waes.</p>

<p>"Th maeden laedy is a Mis Norton,—rich, cultivaeted, and kiend.
She spoek to me at diner to-dae (for I went to taebl again, it's such
fun to woch peepl), and askt me to cum and see her at her room.
She has fien books and pikchers, noes interesting pursons, and seems
frendly; so I shal maek mieself agreeabl, for I <em>do</em> wont to get into
guud soesieety, oenly it isn't th saem sort that Amy lieks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">409</span>
"I wuz in our parlor last evening, when Mr. Bhaer caem in with
sum nuezpaepers for Mrs. Kirke. She wasn't thaer, but Minnie, hoo
is a litl oeld wuuman, introduest me verry pritily: 'This is maama's

<p>"'Yes; and she's joly and we liek her lots,' aded Kity, hoo is
an <i>enfant terribl</i>.</p>

<p>"We boeth bowd, and then we laft, for th prim introdukshon
and th blunt adishon wer rather a comikal contrast.</p>

<p>"'Ah, yes, I heer thees nauty wuns go to vex U, Mees Marsch.

qieet, thae ar rather amuezing, for which, o, be joyful! After whut
Amy wuud call Herculaneum eforts, in th wae of mental and moral
agriculcher, mi yung iedeeas begin to shoot and mi litl twigs to
bend as I cuud wish. Thae ar not so interesting to me as Tina
and th boys, but I do mi duty by them, and thae ar fond of me.
Franz and Emil ar joly litl lads, qiet after mi oen hart; for th
mixcher of German and American spirit in them produces a constant
staet of effervescence. Saturday afternoons ar rieotus times, whether
spent in th hous or out; for on plezant daes thae all go to wauk,
<span class="pagenum2">412</span>
liek a seminarry, with th Professor and mieself to keep order; and
then such fun!</p>

<p>"We ar verry guud frends now, and I've begun to taek lesons.
I reealy couldn't help it, and it all caem about in such a droel
wae that I must tel U. To begin at th begining, Mrs. Kirke
called to me, wun dae, as I past Mr. Bhaer's room, whaer she wuz
rumejing.</p>

<p>"'Did U ever see such a den, mi deer? Just cum and help me
put thees books to riets, for I've turnd everything upsied doun,
trieing to discuver whut he has dun with th six nue hankerchifs I
gaev him not long ago.'</p>

<p>"I went in, and whiel we wurkt I luukt about me, for it wuz 'a
den,' to be shuur. Books and paepers everywhaer; a broeken meershaum,
and an oeld floot oever th mantel-peess as if dun with; a
raged burd, without any tael, churpt on wun windo-seet, and a box of
whiet miess adornd th uther; haf-finisht boets and bits of string
lae amung th manuescripts; durty litl boots stuud drieing befor th
fier; and traeses of th deerly beluved boys, for hoom he maeks a
slaev of himself, wer to be seen all oever th room. After a grand
rumej three of th mising artikls wer found,—wun oever th
burd-caej, wun cuverd with ink, and a thurd burnt broun, having been
uezd as a hoelder.</p>

<p>"'Such a man!' laft guud-naecherd Mrs. K., as she put th
reliks in th rag-bag. 'I supoez th others ar torn up to rig ships,
bandage cut finggers, or maek kiet-taels. It's dredful, but I can't
scoeld him: he's so absent-miended and guud-naecherd, he lets thoes
boys ried oever him ruf-shod. I agreed to do his woshing and
mending, but he forgets to giv out his things and I forget to luuk
them oever, so he cums to a sad pas sumtiems.'</p>

<p>"'Let me mend them,' sed I. 'I don't miend it, and he needn't
noe. I'd liek to,—he's so kiend to me about bringing mi leters
and lending books.'</p>

<p>"So I hav got his things in order, and nit heels into too paers of
th soks,—for thae wer boggled out of shaep with his qeer darns.
Nuthing wuz sed, and I hoept he wouldn't fiend it out, but wun dae
last week he caut me at it. Heering th lesons he givs to others
<span class="pagenum2">413</span>
has interested and amuezd me so much that I tuuk a fansy to lurn;
for Tina runs in and out, leeving th dor oepen, and I can heer. I
had been sitting neer this dor, finishing off th last sok, and trieing
to understand whut he sed to a nue scolar, hoo is as stoopid as I am.
Th gurl had gon, and I thaut he had aulso, it wuz so still, and I wuz
busily gabling oever a verb, and roking to and fro in a moest absurd
wae, when a litl cro maed me luuk up, and thaer wuz Mr. Bhaer
luuking and lafing qieetly, whiel he maed siens to Tina not to betrae
him.</p>

<p>"'So!' he sed, as I stopt and staerd liek a gooss, 'U peep at
me, I peep at U, and that is not bad; but see, I am not pleasanting
when I sae, haf U a wish for German?'</p>

<p>"'Yes; but U ar too busy. I am too stoopid to lurn,' I blunderd
out, as red as a peony.</p>

<p>"'Prut! we wil maek th tiem, and we fael not to fiend th
senss. At efening I shal gif a litl leson with much gladnes; for,
luuk U, Mees Marsch, I haf this det to pae,' and he pointed to
mi wurk. 'Yes, thae sae to wun anuther, thees so kiend laedys, "he is
a stoopid oeld felo; he wil see not whut we do; he wil never opserve
that his sok-heels go not in hoels any mor, he wil think his butons
gro out nue when thae faul, and beleev that strings maek theirselves."
Ah! but I haf an ie, and I see much. I haf a hart, and I
feel th thanks for this. Cum, a litl leson then and now, or no
mor guud faery wurks for me and mien.'</p>

<p>"Of corss I couldn't sae anything after that, and as it reealy is a
splendid oportuenity, I maed th bargan, and we began. I tuuk foer
lesons, and then I stuk fast in a gramatikal bog. Th Professor
wuz verry paeshent with me, but it must hav been torment to him, and
now and then he'd luuk at me with such an expreshon of mield
despaer that it wuz a tos-up with me whether to laf or cri. I
tried boeth waes; and when it caem to a snif of uter mortificaeshon
and wo, he just throo th gramar on to th flor, and marcht out
of th room. I felt mieself disgraest and dezurted forever, but didn't
blaem him a partikl, and wuz scrambling mi paepers together, meening
to rush upstaers and shaek mieself hard, when in he caem, as
brisk and beeming as if I'd cuverd mieself with glory.</p>

"'Now we shal tri a nue wae. U and I wil red thees plezant
litl Märchen together, and dig no mor in that dri book, that goes

<p>"He spoek so kiendly, and oepend Hans Andersen's faery taels so
invietingly befor me, that I wuz mor ashamed than ever, and went at
mi leson in a nek-or-nuthing stiel that seemd to amuez him
imensly. I forgot mi bashfulness, and pegd away (no uther wurd
wil expres it) with all mi miet, tumbling oever long wurds, pronouncing
acording to th inspiraeshon of th mienuet, and dooing mi verry

he clapt his hands and cried out, in his harty wae, 'Das ist gute!
Now we go wel! Mi turn. I do him in German; gif me yuur

vois, and a relish which wuz guud to see as wel as heer. Forchunatly
th story wuz th 'Constant Tin Soeljer,' which is droel, U
noe, so I cuud laf,—and I did,—tho I didn't understand
haf he red, for I couldn't help it, he wuz so urnest, I so exsieted,
and th hoel thing so comikal.</p>

<p>"After that we got on beter, and now I red mi lesons prity

gets tukt into th taels and poetry as wun givs pils in jely. I
liek it verry much, and he doesn't seem tierd of it yet,—which is verry
guud of him, isn't it? I meen to giv him sumthing on Christmas, for
I daer not ofer muny. Tel me sumthing niess, Marmee.</p>

<p>"I'm glad Laurie seems so hapy and busy, that he has given up

<p>"Speeking of books remiends me that I'm geting rich in that lien
for, on Nue Yeer's Dae, Mr. Bhaer gaev me a fien Shakespeare. It is
wun he values much, and I've ofen admierd it, set up in th plaess
of onor, with his German Biebl, Plato, Hoemer, and Milton; so U
mae imajin how I felt when he brought it doun, without its cuver,
and shoed me mi naem in it, 'from mi frend Friedrich Bhaer.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">416</span>
"'U sae ofen U wish a liebraery: heer I gif U wun; for between

<p>"I thankt him as wel as I cuud, and tauk now about 'mi liebraery,'
as if I had a hundred books. I never knew how much thaer wuz in
Shakespeare befor; but then I never had a Bhaer to explaen it to me.
Now <em>don't</em> laf at his horrid naem; it isn't pronounced eether Baer

<p>"Not having much muny, or noeing whut he'd liek, I got several
litl things, and put them about th room, whaer he wuud fiend them
unexpectedly. Thae wer uesful, prity, or funy,—a nue standish
on his taebl, a litl vaess for his flower,—he aulwaes has wun, or a bit
of green in a glas, to keep him fresh, he sez,—and a hoelder for his
blower, so that he needn't burn up whut Amy calls 'mouchoirs.' I
maed it liek thoes Beth invented,—a big butterfly with a fat body, and
blak and yelo wings, wuusted feelers, and beed ies. It tuuk his
fansy imensly, and he put it on his mantel-peess as an artikl of
<i>vertu</i>; so it wuz rather a faeluer after all. Puur as he is, he didn't
forget a survant or a chield in th hous; and not a soel heer, from
th French laundry-wuuman to Mis Norton, forgot him. I wuz so glad
of that.</p>

<p>"Thae got up a maskeraed, and had a gae tiem Nue Yeer's Eve.
I didn't meen to go doun, having no dres; but at th last mienuet,
Mrs. Kirke rememberd sum oeld broekaeds, and Mis Norton lent me
laess and fethers; so I drest up as Mrs. Malaprop, and saeld in
with a mask on. No wun knew me, for I disgiezd mi vois, and no

verry stif and cool, moest of them; and so I am to whipper-snapers)
cuud danss and dres, and burst out into a 'niess deraenjment of

<p class="h2a">A Frend.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Tho</span> verry hapy in th soeshal atmosphere about her, and verry
busy with th daily wurk that urnd her bred, and maed it sweeter
for th efort, Jo still found tiem for literaery laebors. Th purpos
which now tuuk possession of her wuz a nacheral wun to a puur and
ambishus gurl; but th means she tuuk to gaen her end wer not th
best. She saw that muny confurd power: muny and power, thaerfor,
she rezolvd to hav; not to be uezd for herself aloen, but for
thoes hoom she luvd mor than self.</p>

<p>Th dreem of filing hoem with cumforts, giving Beth everything she
wontedw, from strawberrys in winter to an organ in her bedroom; going
abraud herself, and aulwaes having <em>mor</em> than enough, so that she
<span class="pagenum2">419</span>
miet indulj in th lukshery of charrity, had been for yeers Jo's moest
cherrisht casl in th aer.</p>

<p>Th priez-story expeeri’enss had seemd to oepen a wae which miet,
after long travelling and much up-hil wurk leed to this delietful
<i>château en Espagne</i>. But th novel dizaster qencht her curej
for a tiem, for public opinyon is a jieant which has frietend stouter-hearted
Jaks on biger been-stauks than hers. Liek that immortal
heero, she repoezd awhile after th furst atempt, which rezulted in a
tumbl, and th leest luvly of th jieant's treasures, if I remember
rietly. But th "up again and taek anuther" spirit wuz as strong in
Jo as in Jak; so she scrambld up, on th shaedy sied this tiem, and
got mor booty, but neerly left behind her whut wuz far mor precious
than th muny-bags.</p>

<p>She tuuk to rieting sensaeshon storys; for in thoes dark aejes, eeven
all-perfect America red rubish. She toeld no wun, but concocted a
"thriling tael," and boeldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood, editor of
th "Weekly Volcaeno." She had never red "Sartor Resartus," but
she had a wuumanly instinkt that cloeths possess an inflooenss mor
powerful oever meny than th wurth of carrakter or th majik of maners.
So she drest herself in her best, and, trieing to persuade
herself that she wuz neether exsieted nor nurvus, bravely cliemd too
paers of dark and durty staers to fiend herself in a disorderly room, a
cloud of sigar-smoek, and th presence of three jentlmen, sitting
with thaer heels rather hieer than thaer hats, which artikls of dres
nun of them tuuk th trubl to remoov on her apeeranss. Sumwhot
daunted by this resepshon, Jo hezitaeted on th threshhoeld, murmering
in much embarrassment,—</p>

<p>"Excuez me, I wuz luuking for th 'Weekly Volcaeno' ofis; I
wisht to see Mr. Dashwood."</p>

<p>Doun went th hieest paer of heels, up roez th smoekyest jentlman,
and, carefully cherrishing his sigar between his finggers, he advanst,
with a nod, and a countenanss expresiv of nuthing but
sleep. Feeling that she must get thru th mater sumhow, Jo
produced her manuescript, and, blushing reder and reder with eech
sentenss, blunderd out fragments of th litl speech carefully prepaerd
for th ocaezhon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">420</span>
"A frend of mien dezierd me to ofer—a story—just as an experriment—wuud
liek yuur opinyon—be glad to riet mor if this
suits."</p>

<p>Whiel she blushed and blunderd, Mr. Dashwood had taeken th
manuescript, and wuz turning oever th leevs with a paer of rather durty
finggers, and casting critikal glanses up and doun th neet paejes.</p>

<p>"Not a furst atempt, I taek it?" obzurving that th paejes wer
numberd, cuverd oenly on wun sied, and not tied up with a ribon,—shuur
sien of a novis.</p>

<p>"No, sur; she has had sum expeeri’enss, and got a priez for a tael
in th 'Blarneystone Baner.'"</p>

<p>"O, did she?" and Mr. Dashwood gaev Jo a qik luuk, which
seemd to taek noet of everything she had on, from th boe in her
bonnet to th butons on her boots. "Wel, U can leev it, if U
liek. We've mor of this sort of thing on hand than we noe whut
to do with at prezent; but I'll run mi ie oever it, and giv U an
anser next week."</p>

<p>Now, Jo did <em>not</em> liek to leev it, for Mr. Dashwood didn't suit her
at all; but, under th surcumstanses, thaer wuz nuthing for her to do
but boe and wauk away, luuking particularly taul and dignified, as
she wuz apt to do when netld or abasht. Just then she wuz boeth;
for it wuz perfectly evident, from th noeing glanses exchanged
amung th jentlmen, that her litl fikshon of "mi frend" wuz considerd
a guud joek; and a laf, produced by sum inaudibl remark
of th editor, as he cloezd th dor, completed her discumficher.
Haf rezolving never to return, she went hoem, and wurkt off her
iritaeshon by stitching pinafores vigorusly; and in an our or too
wuz cool enough to laf oever th seen, and long for next week.</p>

<p>When she went again, Mr. Dashwood wuz aloen, whaerat she rejoist;
Mr. Dashwood wuz much wieder awake than befor, which wuz
agreeabl; and Mr. Dashwood wuz not too deeply absorbd in a sigar
to remember his maners: so th second intervue wuz much mor
comfortable than th furst.</p>

<p>"We'll taek this" (editors never sae I), "if U don't objekt to a
fue aulteraeshons. It's too long, but oemiting th pasejes I've markt
wil maek it just th riet length," he sed, in a business-liek toen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">421</span>
Jo hardly knew her oen MS. again, so crumpld and underscord
wer its paejes and parragrafs; but, feeling as a tender paerent miet
on being askt to cut off her baeby's legs in order that it miet fit into
a nue craedl, she luukt at th markt pasejes, and wuz serpriezd to
fiend that all th moral reflekshons—which she had carefully put in as
balast for much roemanss—had been striken out.</p>

<p>"But, sur, I thaut every story should hav sum sort of a moral,
so I tuuk caer to hav a fue of mi sinners repent."</p>

<p>Mr. Dashwood's editorial gravity relaxt into a smiel, for Jo had
forgoten her "frend," and spoeken as oenly an author cuud.</p>

<p>"Peepl wont to be amuezd, not preecht at, U noe. Morals
don't sel nowadaes;" which wuz not qiet a corekt statement, by
th wae.</p>

<p>"U think it wuud do with thees aulteraeshons, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it's a nue plot, and prity wel wurkt up—langgwej
guud, and so on," wuz Mr. Dashwood's affable replie.</p>

<p>"Whut do U—that is, whut compensaeshon—" began Jo, not
exaktly noeing how to expres herself.</p>

<p>"O, yes, wel, we giv from twenty-fiev to thurty for things of this
sort. Pae when it cums out," returnd Mr. Dashwood, as if that
pointer had escaept him; such trifles ofen do escaep th editorial
miend, it is sed.</p>

<p>"Verry wel; U can hav it," sed Jo, handing bak th story,
with a satisfied aer; for, after th dolar-a-column wurk, eeven twenty-fiev
seemd guud pae.</p>

<p>"Shal I tel mi frend U wil taek anuther if she has wun beter
than this?" askt Jo, unconshus of her litl slip of th tung, and
emboldened by her success.</p>

<p>"Wel, we'll luuk at it; can't promis to taek it. Tel her to maek
it short and spiesy, and never miend th moral. Whut naem wuud
yuur frend liek to put to it?" in a careless toen.</p>

<p>"Nun at all, if U pleez; she doesn't wish her naem to apeer,
and has no <i>nom de plume</i>," sed Jo, blushing in spiet of herself.</p>

<p>"Just as she lieks, of corss. Th tael wil be out next week;
wil U call for th muny, or shal I send it?" askt Mr. Dashwood,
hoo felt a nacheral dezier to noe hoo his nue contributor miet be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">422</span>
"I'll call. Guud morning, sur."</p>

<p>As she departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his feet, with th graesful
remark, "Puur and proud, as uezhual, but she'll do."</p>

<p>Foloeing Mr. Dashwood's direkshons, and maeking Mrs. Northbury
her model, Jo rashly tuuk a plunj into th frothy see of sensaeshonal
literachuur; but, thanks to th lief-preserver throen her by a frend,
she caem up again, not much th wurss for her duking.</p>

<p>Liek moest yung scriblers, she went abraud for her carrakters
and seenery; and banditti, counts, jipsys, nuns, and ducheses apeerd
upon her staej, and plaed thaer parts with as much accuracy
and spirit as cuud be expected. Her reeders wer not particular
about such trifles as gramar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr.
Dashwood graeshusly permited her to fil his columns at th loeest
prieses, not thinking it nesesaery to tel her that th reeal cauz of his
hospitality wuz th fakt that wun of his haks, on being oferd hieer
waejes, had basely left him in th lurch.</p>

<p>She soon becaem interested in her wurk, for her emaeshiaeted purss
groo stout, and th litl hord she wuz maeking to taek Beth to th
mountens next sumer groo sloely but surely as th weeks past.
Wun thing disturbs her satisfakshon, and that wuz that she did not
tel them at hoem. She had a feeling that faather and muther wuud
not aproov, and prefurd to hav her oen wae furst, and beg pardon
afterward. It wuz eezy to keep her seecret, for no naem apeerd
with her storys; Mr. Dashwood had, of corss, found it out verry
soon, but promist to be dum; and, for a wunder, kept his wurd.</p>

<p>She thaut it wuud do her no harm, for she sincerely ment to
riet nuthing of which she should be ashamed, and qieeted all priks
of conshenss by antisipaeshons of th hapy mienuet when she should
sho her urnestly and laf oever her wel-kept seecret.</p>

<p>But Mr. Dashwood rejekted any but thriling taels; and, as thrils
cuud not be produced exsept by harroeing up th soels of th reeders,
history and roemanss, land and see, sieenss and art, poleess records
and loonatik asylums, had to be ransakt for th purpos. Jo soon
found that her inosent expeeri’enss had given her but fue glimpses of
th trajik wurld which underlies soesieety; so, regarding it in a business
liet, she set about suplieing her defishensys with carrakteristik
<span class="pagenum2">423</span>
enerjy. Eeger to fiend mateerial for storys, and bent on maeking them
orijinal in plot, if not masterly in exsecueshon, she surcht nuezpaepers
for accidents, insidents, and criems; she exsieted th suspishons of
public liebraerians by asking for wurks on poizons; she studyd faeses in
th street, and carrakters, guud, bad, and indiferent, all about her;
she delvd in th dust of ancient times for fakts or fikshons so oeld that
thae wer as guud as nue, and introduest herself to foly, sin, and
mizery, as wel as her limited oportuenitys alowd. She thaut she
wuz prospering fienly; but, unconshusly, she wuz begining to desecraet
sum of th womanliest atribuets of a wuuman's carrakter.
She wuz living in bad soesieety; and, imajinarry tho it wuz, its inflooenss
affected her, for she wuz feeding hart and fansy on daenjerus and
unsubstantial food, and wuz fast brushing th inosent bloom from her
naechuur by a premature aqaentanss with th darker sied of lief, which
cums soon enough to all of us.</p>

<p>She wuz begining to feel rather than see this, for much descriebing
of uther peepl's pashons and feelings set her to studying and specuelaeting
about her oen,—a morbid amuezment, in which helthy yung
miends do not voluntaerily indulj. Rong-dooing aulwaes brings its
oen punishment; and, when Jo moest needed hers, she got it.</p>

<p>I don't noe whether th study of Shakespeare helpt her to red
carrakter, or th nacheral instinkt of a wuuman for whut wuz onest,
braev, and strong; but whiel endowing her imajinarry heroes with
every perfection under th sun, Jo wuz discuvering a liv heero, hoo
interested her in spiet of meny hueman imperfekshons. Mr. Bhaer, in
wun of thaer conversations, had advised her to study simpl, troo, and
luvly carrakters, whaerever she found them, as guud traening for a
rieter. Jo tuuk him at his wurd, for she coolly turnd round and
studyd him,—a proceeding which wuud hav much serpriezd him,
had he noen it, for th wurthy Professor wuz verry humbl in his oen
conseet.</p>

<p>Whi everybody liked him wuz whut puzzled Jo, at furst. He wuz
neether rich nor graet, yung nor handsum; in no respekt whut is
called fasinaeting, impoezing, or brilliant; and yet he wuz as atraktiv
as a jeenial fier, and peepl seemd to gather about him as nacheraly
as about a worm harth. He wuz puur, yet aulwaes apeerd to be giving
<span class="pagenum2">424</span>
sumthing away; a straenjer, yet every wun wuz his frend; no
longer yung, but as hapy-hearted as a boy; plaen and peculiar, yet
his faess luukt buetiful to meny, and his oditys wer freely forgiven
for his saek. Jo ofen wocht him, trieing to discuver th charm,
and, at last, desieded that it wuz benevolenss which wurkt th mirakl.
If he had any sorro, "it sat with its hed under its wing,"
and he turnd oenly his suny sied to th wurld. Thaer wer liens
upon his forhed, but Tiem seemd to hav tucht him jently,
remembering how kiend he wuz to others. Th plezant curvs about
his mouth wer th memorials of meny frendly wurds and cheery
lafs; his ies wer never coeld or hard, and his big hand had a
worm, strong grasp that wuz mor expresiv than wurds.</p>

<p>His verry cloeths seemd to partaek of th hospitabl naechuur of th
wearer. Thae luukt as if thae wer at eez, and liked to maek him
comfortable; his capacious waestcoet wuz suggestive of a larj hart
underneeth; his rusty coet had a soeshal aer, and th bagy pokets
plainly proovd that litl hands ofen went in empty and caem out
fuul; his verry boots wer benevolent, and his collars never stif and
raspy liek uther peepl's.</p>

<p>"That's it!" sed Jo to herself, when she at length discuverd that
jenuein guud-wil tords' wun's felo-men cuud beautify and dignifi
eeven a stout German teecher, hoo shovelled in his diner, darnd his
oen soks, and wuz burdend with th naem of Bhaer.</p>

<p>Jo valued guudnes hiely, but she aulso possessed a moest feminine
respekt for intelekt, and a litl discuvery which she maed about th
Professor aded much to her regard for him. He never spoek of himself,
and no wun ever knew that in his naetiv sity he had been a man
much onord and esteemed for lurning and integrity, till a countryman
caem to see him, and, in a conversation with Mis Norton, divulged
th pleezing fakt. From her Jo lurnd it, and liked it all th
beter because Mr. Bhaer had never toeld it. She felt proud to noe
that he wuz an onord Professor in Berlin, tho oenly a puur
langgwej-master in America; and his hoemly, hard-wurking lief wuz
much beautified by th spiess of roemanss which this discuvery gaev it.</p>

<p>Anuther and a beter gift than intelekt wuz shoen her in a moest
unexpekted maner. Mis Norton had th <i>entrée</i> into literaery soesieety,
<span class="pagenum2">425</span>
which Jo wuud hav had no chanss of seeing but for her. Th solitaery
wuuman felt an interest in th ambishus gurl, and kiendly confurd
meny faevors of this sort boeth on Jo and th Professor. She tuuk them
with her, wun niet, to a selekt simpoezium, held in onor of several
selebritys.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 576px;">

</div>

<p>Jo went prepaerd to boe doun and ador th miety wuns hoom
she had wurshipt with yoothful enthusiasm afar off. But her reverenss
for jeenyus reseevd a seveer shok that niet, and it tuuk her
sum tiem to recuver from th discuvery that th graet creechers wer
oenly men and wimen after all. Imajin her dismae, on stealing a
glanss of timid admeraeshon at th poeet hoos liens sugjested an etheerial
being fed on "spirit, fier, and due," to behoeld him devouring his
super with an ardor which flusht his intelekchual countenanss.
Turning as from a faulen iedol, she maed uther discuverys which rapidly
dispeld her roemantik iloozhons. Th graet novelist viebraeted between
too decanters with th reguelarrity of a penjulum; th faemus
divine flurted oepenly with wun of th Madame de Staëls of th aej,
hoo luukt dagers at anuther Corinne, hoo wuz amiably satiriezing
<span class="pagenum2">426</span>
her, after out-manœuvring her in eforts to absorb th profound philosopher,
hoo imbiebed tee Johnsonianly and apeerd to slumber, th
loeqasity of th laedy rendering speech imposibl. Th sieentifikly
selebritys, forgeting thaer molusks and glaeshal periods, gosipt
about art, whiel devoeting themselvs to oisters and ieses with carrakteristik
enerjy; th yung muezishan, hoo wuz charming th sity liek
a second Orpheus, taukt horses; and th specimen of th British
noebility prezent happened to be th moest ordinaery man of th party.</p>

<p>Befor th evening wuz haf oever, Jo felt so completely 
<i>désillusionée</i>, that she sat doun in a corner to 
recuver herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joind her, luuking rather out of his 
element, and prezently several of th philosophers, eech mounted on 
his hoby, caem ambling up to hoeld an intelekchual tuurnament in th 
resess (vurb). Th conversation wuz miels beyond Jo's comprehension, but she 
enjoyd it, tho Kant and Hegel wer unnoen gods, th Subjektiv 
and Objektiv unintelijibl turms; and th oenly thing "evolved from 
her iner conshusnes," wuz a bad hedaek after it wuz all oever. 
It daund upon her grajualy that th wurld wuz being pikt to pieces, 
and put together on nue, and, acording to th taekers, on infinitly 
beter prinsipls than befor; that relijon wuz in a faer wae to be 
reezond into nuthingnes, and intelekt wuz to be th oenly God. Jo knew
nuthing about philosophy or metafiziks of any sort, but a cuerius
exsietment, haf plezherabl, haf paenful, caem oever her, as she lisend
with a senss of being turnd adrift into tiem and spaess, liek a
yung balloon out on a holidae.</p>

<p>She luukt round to see how th Professor liked it, and found him
luuking at her with th grimest expreshon she had ever seen him
waer. He shuuk his hed, and becond her to cum away; but she
wuz fasinaeted, just then, by th freedom of Specuelaetiv Philosophy,
and kept her seet, trieing to fiend out whut th wiez jentlmen intended
to relie upon after thae had anieilaeted all th oeld beleefs.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Bhaer wuz a difident man, and slo to ofer his oen
opinyons, not because thae wer unsetld, but too sincere and urnest
to be lietly spoeken. As he glanst from Jo to several uther yung
peepl, atrakted by th brilliancy of th philosophic pyrotechnics, he
nit his brows, and longed to speek, feering that sum inflamabl
<span class="pagenum2">427</span>
yung soel wuud be led astray by th rokets, to fiend, when th displae
wuz oever, that thae had oenly an empty stik or a scorcht hand.</p>

<p>He bor it as long as he cuud; but when he wuz apeeld to for
an opinyon, he blaezd up with onest indignaeshon, and defended relijon
with all th eloquence of trooth,—an eloquence which maed his
broeken English muezikal, and his plaen faess buetiful. He had a hard
fiet, for th wiez men argued wel; but he didn't noe when he wuz
beeten, and stuud to his culors liek a man. Sumhow, as he taukt,
th wurld got riet again to Jo; th oeld beleefs, that had lasted so
long, seemd beter than th nue; God wuz not a bliend forss, and
imortality wuz not a prity faebl, but a blest fakt. She felt as if
she had solid ground under her feet again; and when Mr. Bhaer
paused, out-taukt, but not wun whit convinced, Jo wontedw to clap
her hands and thank him.</p>

<p>She did neether; but she rememberd this seen, and gaev th
Professor her hartyest respekt, for she knew it cost him an efort to
speek out then and thaer, because his conshenss wuud not let him
be silent. She began to see that carrakter is a beter possession than
muny, rank, intelekt, or buety; and to feel that if graetnes is whut
a wiez man has defiend it to be, "trooth, reverenss, and guud-wil,"
then her frend Friedrich Bhaer wuz not oenly guud, but graet.</p>

<p>This beleef strengthend daily. She valued his esteem, she cuveted
his respekt, she wontedw to be wurthy of his frendship; and, just when
th wish wuz sincerest, she caem neer loozing everything. It all groo
out of a cokt hat; for wun evening th Professor caem in to giv
Jo her leson, with a paeper soeljer-cap on his hed, which Tina had
put thaer, and he had forgoten to taek off.</p>

<p>"It's evident he doesn't luuk in his glas befor cuming doun,"
thaut Jo, with a smiel, as he sed "Goot efening," and sat soeberly
doun, qiet unconshus of th loodicrus contrast between his subjekt
and his hed-geer, for he wuz going to red her th "Deth of
Wallenstein."</p>

</div>

<p>She sed nuthing at furst, for she liked to heer him laf out his
big, harty laf, when anything funy happened, so she left him to
discuver it for himself, and prezently forgot all about it; for to heer a
German red Schiller is rather an absorbing ocuepaeshon. After th
<span class="pagenum2">428</span>
reeding caem th leson, which wuz a lievly wun, for Jo wuz in a gae
mood that niet, and th cokt-hat kept her ies dansing with merriment.
Th Professor didn't noe whut to maek of her, and stopt
at last, to ask, with an aer of mield serpriez that wuz irezistibl,—</p>

<p>"Mees Marsch, for whut do U laf in yuur master's faess? Haf
U no respekt for me, that U go on so bad?"</p>

<p>"How can I be respektful, sur, when U forget to taek yuur hat
off?" sed Jo.</p>

<p>Lifting his hand to his hed, th absent-miended Professor gravely
felt and remoovd th litl cokt-hat, luukt at it a mienuet, and then
throo bak his hed, and laft liek a merry bas-vieol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">429</span>
"Ah! I see him now; it is that imp Tina hoo maeks me a fool
with mi cap. Wel, it is nuthing; but see U, if this leson goes
not wel, U too shal waer him."</p>

<p>But th leson did not go at all for a fue minits, because Mr.
Bhaer caut siet of a pikcher on th hat, and, unfoelding it, sed,
with an aer of graet disgust,—</p>

<p>"I wish thees paepers did not cum in th hous; thae ar not for
children to see, nor yung peepl to red. It is not wel, and I haf
no paeshenss with thoes hoo maek this harm."</p>

<p>Jo glanst at th sheet, and saw a pleezing ilustraeshon compoezd
of a loonatik, a corps, a vilan, and a vieper. She did not liek it;
but th impulss that maed her turn it oever wuz not wun of displeasure,
but feer, because, for a mienuet, she fansyd th paeper wuz th "Volcaeno."
It wuz not, however, and her panik subsided as she rememberd
that, eeven if it had been, and wun of her oen taels in it, thaer
wuud hav been no naem to betrae her. She had betraed herself,
however, by a luuk and a blush; for, tho an absent man, th Professor
saw a guud deel mor than peepl fansyd. He knew that Jo
roet, and had met her doun amung th nuezpaeper ofises mor than
wunss; but as she never spoek of it, he askt no qeschons, in spiet
of a strong dezier to see her wurk. Now it ocurd to him that she
wuz dooing whut she wuz ashamed to oen, and it trubld him. He
did not sae to himself, "It is nun of mi business; I've no riet to sae
anything," as meny peepl wuud hav dun; he oenly rememberd that
she wuz yung and puur, a gurl far away from muther's luv and faather's
caer; and he wuz moovd to help her with an impulss as qik
and nacheral as that which wuud prompt him to put out his hand to
saev a baeby from a pudl. All this flasht thru his miend in a
mienuet, but not a traess of it apeerd in his faess; and by th tiem
th paeper wuz turnd, and Jo's needl threded, he wuz redy to sae
qiet nacheraly, but verry gravely,—</p>

<p>"Yes, U ar riet to put it from U. I do not liek to think
that guud yung gurls should see such things. Thae ar maed
plezant to sum, but I wuud mor rather giv mi boys gunpowder
to plae with than this bad trash."</p>

<p>"All mae not be bad, oenly sily, U noe; and if thaer is a demand
<span class="pagenum2">430</span>
for it, I don't see any harm in suplieing it. Meny verry respektabl
peepl maek an onest living out of whut ar called sensaeshon
storys," sed Jo, scraching gathers so enerjetikaly that a row (noun) of
litl slits foloed her pin.</p>

<p>"Thaer is a demand for whisky, but I think U and I do not
caer to sel it. If th respektabl peepl knew whut harm thae did,
thae wuud not feel that th living <em>wuz</em> onest. Thae haf no riet to
put poizon in th sugar-plum, and let th small wuns eat it. No;
thae should think a litl, and sweep mud in th street befor thae do
this thing."</p>

<p>Mr. Bhaer spoek wormly, and waukt to th fier, crumpling th
paeper in his hands. Jo sat still, luuking as if th fier had cum to
her; for her cheeks burnd long after th cokt hat had turnd to
smoek, and gon harmlessly up th chimny.</p>

<p>"I should liek much to send all th rest after him," muterd th
Professor, cuming bak with a releevd aer.</p>

<p>Jo thaut whut a blaez her piel of paepers upstaers wuud maek,
and her hard-urnd muny lae rather hevily on her conshenss at
that mienuet. Then she thaut consolingly to herself, "Mien ar not
liek that; thae ar oenly sily, never bad, so I wun't be wuryd;" and
taeking up her book, she sed, with a stoodius faess,—</p>

<p>"Shal we go on, sur? I'll be verry guud and proper now."</p>

<p>"I shal hoep so," wuz all he sed, but he ment mor than she
imajind; and th graev, kiend luuk he gaev her maed her feel as if
th wurds "Weekly Volcaeno" wer printing in larj tiep on her forhed.</p>

<p>As soon as she went to her room, she got out her paepers, and carefully
re-red every wun of her storys. Being a litl short-sieted, Mr.
Bhaer sumtiems uezd ie-glases, and Jo had tried them wunss, smieling
to see how thae magnified th fien print of her book; now she
seemd to hav got on th Professor's mental or moral spektakls
aulso; for th faults of thees puur storys glaerd at her dredfuly, and
fild her with dismae.</p>

<p>"Thae <em>ar</em> trash, and wil soon be wurss than trash if I go on; for
eech is mor sensaeshonal than th last. I've gon bliendly on, hurting
mieself and uther peepl, for th saek of muny; I noe it's so, for
<span class="pagenum2">431</span>
I can't red this stuf in soeber urnest without being horribly ashamed
of it; and whut <em>should</em> I do if thae wer seen at hoem, or Mr. Bhaer
got hoeld of them?"</p>

<p>Jo turnd hot at th baer iedeea, and stuft th hoel bundle into her
stoev, neerly setting th chimny afire with th blaez.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 552px;">
<a name="b158.png" id="b158.png"></a>
<img src="./LitlWimen_files/b158.png" width="552" height="400" alt="Jo stuffed the whole bundle into the stove" title="Jo stuffed the whole bundle into the stove">
</div>

<p>"Yes, that's th best plaess for such inflamabl nonsenss; I'd
beter burn th hous doun, I supoez, than let uther peepl blo
themselvs up with mi gunpowder," she thaut, as she wocht th
"Deemon of th Jura" whisk away, a litl blak cinder with fiery ies.</p>

<p>But when nuthing remaend of all her three munths' wurk exsept a
heep of ashes, and th muny in her lap, Jo luukt soeber, as she sat on
th flor, wundering whut she aut to do about her waejes.</p>

<p>"I think I haeven't dun much harm <em>yet</em>, and mae keep this to pae
for mi tiem," she sed, after a long meditaeshon, ading impaeshently,
"I aulmoest wish I hadn't any conshenss, it's so inconveeni’ent. If
I didn't caer about dooing riet, and didn't feel uncumfortabl when
dooing rong, I should get on capitally. I can't help wishing sumtiems,
that faather and muther hadn't been so particular about such
things."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">432</span>
Ah, Jo, insted of wishing that, thank God that "faather and
muther <em>wer</em> particular," and pity from yuur hart thoes hoo hav
no such guardians to hej them round with prinsipls which mae
seem liek prizon-wauls to impaeshent yooth, but which wil proov shuur
foundaeshons to build carrakter upon in wuumanhuud.</p>

<p>Jo roet no mor sensaeshonal storys, desieding that th muny did
not pae for her shaer of th sensaeshon; but, going to th uther extreem,
as is th wae with peepl of her stamp, she tuuk a corss of
Mrs. Sherwood, Mis Edgeworth, and Hannah Mor; and then produced
a tael which miet hav been mor properly called an essay or
a surmon, so intensely moral wuz it. She had her doubts about it
from th begining; for her lievly fansy and gurlish roemanss felt as il
at eez in th nue stiel as she wuud hav dun maskeraeding in th
stif and cumbrus costume of th last senchery. She sent this diedaktik
jem to several markets, but it found no purchaser; and she wuz
inclined to agree with Mr. Dashwood, that morals didn't sel.</p>

<p>Then she tried a chield's story, which she cuud eezily hav dispoezd
of if she had not been mursenaery enough to demand filthy looker for
it. Th oenly purson hoo oferd enough to maek it wurth her whiel
to tri jooveniel literachuur wuz a wurthy jentlman hoo felt it his mishon
to convurt all th wurld to his particular beleef. But much as she
liked to riet for children, Jo cuud not consent to depikt all her
nauty boys as being eeten by baers or tost by mad buuls, because
thae did not go to a particular Sabath-scool, nor all th guud infants,
hoo did go, as reworded by every kiend of bliss, from gilded jinjerbred
to escorts of aenjels, when thae departed this lief with psalms or surmons
on thaer lisping tungs. So nuthing caem of thees trieals; and Jo
corkt up her inkstand, and sed, in a fit of verry hoelsum huemility,—</p>

<p>"I don't noe anything; I'll waet till I do befor I tri again, and,
meentiem, 'sweep mud in th street,' if I can't do beter; that's
onest, at leest;" which desizhon proovd that her second tumbl
doun th been-stauk had dun her sum guud.</p>

<p>Whiel thees inturnal revolooshons wer going on, her exturnal lief
had been as busy and uneventful as uezhual; and if she sumtiems
luukt seerius or a litl sad no wun obzurvd it but Professor Bhaer.
He did it so qieetly that Jo never knew he wuz woching to see if she
<span class="pagenum2">433</span>
wuud accept and profit by his reproof; but she stuud th test, and
he wuz satisfied; for, tho no wurds past between them, he
knew that she had given up rieting. Not oenly did he ges it by th
fakt that th second fingger of her riet hand wuz no longer inky, but
she spent her evenings dounstaers now, wuz met no mor amung
nuezpaeper ofises, and studyd with a dogd paeshenss, which ashuurd
him that she wuz bent on ocuepieing her miend with sumthing uesful,
if not plezant.</p>

<p>He helpt her in meny waes, prooving himself a troo frend, and Jo
wuz hapy; for, whiel her pen lae iedl, she wuz lurning uther lesons
besied German, and laeing a foundaeshon for th sensaeshon story of her
oen lief.</p>

<p>It wuz a plezant winter and a long wun, for she did not leev Mrs.
Kirke till June. Every wun seemd sorry when th tiem caem; th
children wer inconsolabl, and Mr. Bhaer's haer stuk straet up all
oever his hed, for he aulwaes rumpld it wieldly when disturbs in
miend.</p>

<p>"Going hoem? Ah, U ar hapy that U haf a hoem to go in,"
he sed, when she toeld him, and sat silently puuling his beard, in th
corner, whiel she held a litl levee on that last evening.</p>

<p>She wuz going eerly, so she bade them all guud-by oever niet;
and when his turn caem, she sed wormly,—</p>

<p>"Now, sur, U wun't forget to cum and see us, if U ever travel
our wae, wil U? I'll never forgiv U if U do, for I wont them
all to noe mi frend."</p>

<p>"Do U? Shal I cum?" he askt, luuking doun at her with
an eeger expreshon which she did not see.</p>

<p>"Yes, cum next munth; Laurie grajuatts then, and U'd enjoy
Commencement as sumthing nue."</p>

<p>"That is yuur best frend, of hoom U speek?" he sed, in an
aulterd toen.</p>

<p>"Yes, mi boy Teddy; I'm verry proud of him, and should liek U
to see him."</p>

<p>Jo luukt up then, qiet unconshus of anything but her oen
plezher in th prospekt of shoeing them to wun anuther. Sumthing
in Mr. Bhaer's faess sudenly recauld th fakt that she miet fiend
<span class="pagenum2">434</span>
Laurie mor than a "best frend," and, simply because she particularly
wisht not to luuk as if anything wuz th mater, she involuntarrily
began to blush; and th mor she tried not to, th reder
she groo. If it had not been for Tina on her nee, she didn't noe
whut wuud hav becum of her. Forchunatly, th chield wuz moovd
to hug her; so she manejd to hied her faess an instant, hoeping th
Professor did not see it. But he did, and his oen chaenjd again
from that moementaery anxiety to its uezhual expreshon, as he sed
corjaly,—</p>

<p>"I feer I shal not maek th tiem for that, but I wish th frend
much success, and U all hapynes. Gott bles U!" and with
that, he shuuk hands wormly, shouldered Tina, and went away.</p>

<p>But after th boys wer abed, he sat long befor his fier, with th
tierd luuk on his faess, and th "<i>heimweh</i>," or hoemsiknes, lieing
hevy at his hart. Wunss, when he rememberd Jo, as she sat with
th litl chield in her lap and that nue softnes in her faess, he leend
his hed on his hands a mienuet, and then roemd about th room, as
if in surch of sumthing that he cuud not fiend.</p>

<p>"It is not for me; I must not hoep it now," he sed to himself,
with a sie that wuz aulmoest a groen; then, as if reproeching himself
for th longing that he cuud not repres, he went and kist th
too towzled heds upon th pilo, tuuk doun his seldom-uezd meershaum,
and oepend his Plato.</p>

<p>He did his best, and did it manfuly; but I don't think he found
that a paer of rampant boys, a piep, or eeven th divine Plato, wer
verry satisfaktory substitoots for wief and chield and hoem.</p>

<p>Eerly as it wuz, he wuz at th staeshon, next morning, to see Jo off;
and, thanks to him, she began her solitaery jurny with th plezant
memory of a familyar faess smieling its faerwel, a bunch of vieolets to
keep her company, and, best of all, th hapy thaut,—</p>

<p>"Wel, th winter's gon, and I've riten no books, urnd no
forchun; but I've maed a frend wurth having, and I'll tri to keep
him all mi lief."</p>

oraeshon with th graess of a Phillips and th eloquence of a Demosthenes,
so his frends sed. Thae wer all thaer, his grandfaather,—o,
so proud!—Mr. and Mrs. March, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and
all exulted oever him with th sincere admeraeshon which boys maek liet
of at th tiem, but fael to win from th wurld by any after-trieumfs.</p>

<p>"I've got to stae for this confounded super, but I shal be hoem
eerly to-morro; U'll cum and meet me as uezhual, gurls?" Laurie
sed, as he put th sisters into th carrej after th joys of th dae
wer oever. He sed "gurls," but he ment Jo, for she wuz th oenly
wun hoo kept up th oeld custom; she had not th hart to refuez her
splendid, successful boy anything, and anserd wormly,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">436</span>
"I'll cum, Teddy, raen or shien, and march befor U, plaeing
'<em>Hael th conkering heero cums</em>,' on a jews-harp."</p>

<p>Laurie thankt her with a luuk that maed her think, in a suden
panik, "O, deary me! I noe he'll sae sumthing, and then whut
shal I do?"</p>

<p>Evening meditaeshon and morning wurk sumwhot alaed her feers,
and having desieded that she wouldn't be vaen enough to think peepl
wer going to propoez when she had given them every reezon to
noe whut her anser wuud be, she set forth at th appointed tiem,
hoeping Teddy wouldn't do anything to maek her hurt his puur litl
feelings. A call at Meg's, and a refreshing snif and sip at th Daezy
and Demijon, still further fortified her for th 
<i>tête-à-tête</i>, but when she saw a staulwart 
figuer looming in th distanss, she had a strong dezier to turn about 
and run away.</p>

<p>"Whaer's th jews-harp, Jo?" cried Laurie, as soon as he wuz
within speeking distanss.</p>

<p>"I forgot it;" and Jo tuuk hart again, for that saluetaeshon cuud
not be called luver-liek.</p>

<p>She aulwaes uezd to taek his arm on thees ocaezhons; now she did
not, and he maed no complaent, which wuz a bad sien, but taukt on
rapidly about all sorts of far-away subjekts, till thae turnd from th
roed into th litl path that led hoemward thru th groev. Then
he waukt mor sloely, sudenly lost his fien flo of langgwej, and,
now and then, a dredful pause ocurd. To rescue th conversation
from wun of th wels of silence into which it kept fauling, Jo sed
haestily,—</p>

<p>"Now U must hav a guud long holidae!"</p>

<p>"I intend to."</p>

<p>Sumthing in his rezoloot toen maed Jo luuk up qikly to fiend
him luuking doun at her with an expreshon that ashuurd her th
dreded moement had cum, and maed her put out her hand with an
imploring,—</p>

<p>"No, Teddy, pleez don't!"</p>

<p>"I wil, and U <em>must</em> heer me. It's no uez, Jo; we've got to
hav it out, and th sooner th beter for boeth of us," he anserd,
geting flusht and exsieted all at wunss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">437</span>
"Sae whut U liek, then; I'll lisen," sed Jo, with a desperat
sort of paeshenss.</p>

<p>Laurie wuz a yung luver, but he wuz in urnest, and ment to
"hav it out," if he died in th atempt; so he plunjd into th subjekt
with carrakteristik impechuosity, saeing in a vois that <em>wuud</em> get
choky now and then, in spiet of manful eforts to keep it steady,—</p>

<p>"I've luvd U ever sinss I've noen U, Jo; couldn't help it,
U've been so guud to me. I've tried to sho it, but U wouldn't
let me; now I'm going to maek U heer, and giv me an anser,
for I <em>can't</em> go on so any longer."</p>

<p>"I wontedw to saev U this; I thaut U'd understand—" began
Jo, fiending it a graet deel harder than she expected.</p>

<p>"I noe U did; but gurls ar so qeer U never noe whut
thae meen. Thae sae No when thae meen Yes, and driev a man
out of his wits just for th fun of it," returnd Laurie, entrenching himself
behind an undeniable fakt.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> don't. I never wontedw to maek U caer for me so, and I went
away to keep U from it if I cuud."</p>

<p>"I thaut so; it wuz liek U, but it wuz no uez. I oenly luvd
U all th mor, and I wurkt hard to pleez U, and I gaev
up billiards and everything U didn't liek, and waeted and never
complaend, for I hoept U'd luv me, tho I'm not haf guud
enough—" heer thaer wuz a choek that couldn't be controeld, so he
decapitaeted buttercups whiel he cleerd his "confounded throet."</p>

<p>"Yes, U ar; U're a graet deel too guud for me, and I'm so
graetful to U, and so proud and fond of U, I don't see whi I can't
luv U as U wont me to. I've tried, but I can't chaenj th feeling,
and it wuud be a lie to sae I do when I don't."</p>

<p>"Reealy, truly, Jo?"</p>

<p>He stopt short, and caut boeth her hands as he put his qeschon
with a luuk that she did not soon forget.</p>

<p>"Reealy, truly, deer."</p>

<p>Thae wer in th groev now, cloez by th stiel; and when th last
wurds fel reluktantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropt her hands and
turnd as if to go on, but for wunss in his lief that fenss wuz too much
for him; so he just laed his hed doun on th mosy poest, and stuud
so still that Jo wuz frietend.</p>

"O Teddy, I'm so sorry, so desperatly sorry, I cuud kil mieself
if it wuud do any guud! I wish U wouldn't taek it so hard. I
can't help it; U noe it's imposibl for peepl to maek themselvs
luv uther peepl if thae don't," cried Jo inelegantly but remorsfuly,
as she softly pated his shoulder, remembering th tiem
when he had cumforted her so long ago.</p>

<p>"Thae do sumtiems," sed a mufld vois from th poest.</p>

<p>"I don't beleev it's th riet sort of luv, and I'd rather not tri
it," wuz th desieded anser.</p>

<p>Thaer wuz a long pause, whiel a blakburd sung blithely on th wilo
by th river, and th taul gras rusld in th wiend. Prezently Jo
sed verry soeberly, as she sat doun on th step of th stiel,—</p>

<p>"Laurie, I wont to tel U sumthing."</p>

<p>He started as if he had been shot, throo up his hed, and cried
out, in a feerss toen—</p>

<p>"<em>Don't</em> tel me that, Jo; I can't baer it now!"</p>

<p>"Tel whut?" she askt, wundering at his vieolenss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">439</span>
"That U luv that oeld man."</p>

<p>"Whut oeld man?" demanded Jo, thinking he must meen his
grandfaather.</p>

<p>"That devilish Professor U wer aulwaes rieting about. If U
sae U luv him, I noe I shal do sumthing desperat;" and he
luukt as if he wuud keep his wurd, as he clencht his hands, with a
rathful spark in his ies.</p>

<p>Jo wontedw to laf, but restraend herself, and sed wormly, for
she, too, wuz geting exsieted with all this,—</p>

<p>"Don't swear, Teddy! He isn't oeld, nor anything bad, but guud
and kiend, and th best frend I've got, next to U. Prae, don't fli
into a pashon; I wont to be kiend, but I noe I shal get anggry if
U abuez mi Professor. I haeven't th leest iedeea of luving him or
anybody else."</p>

<p>"But U wil after a whiel, and then whut wil becum of me?"</p>

<p>"U'll luv sum wun else too, liek a sensibl boy, and forget all
this trubl."</p>

<p>"I <em>can't</em> luv any wun else; and I'll never forget U, Jo, never!
never!" with a stamp to emfasiez his pashonat wurds.</p>

<p>"Whut <em>shal</em> I do with him?" sighed Jo, fiending that emotions
wer mor unmanejabl than she expected. "U haeven't hurd
whut I wontedw to tel U. Sit doun and lisen; for indeed I wont
to do riet and maek U hapy," she sed, hoeping to sooth him
with a litl reezon, which proovd that she knew nuthing about luv.</p>

<p>Seeing a rae of hoep in that last speech, Laurie throo himself doun
on th gras at her feet, leend his arm on th loeer step of th stiel,
and luukt up at her with an expectant faess. Now that araenjment
wuz not conducive to calm speech or cleer thaut on Jo's part; for
how <em>cuud</em> she sae hard things to her boy whiel he wocht her with
ies fuul of luv and longing, and lashes still wet with th biter drop
or too her hardnes of hart had wrung from him? She jently
turnd his hed away, saeing, as she stroekt th waevy haer which
had been alowd to gro for her saek,—how tuching that wuz, to
be shuur!—</p>

<p>"I agree with muther that U and I ar not suited to eech uther,
because our qik tempers and strong wils wuud probably maek us
<span class="pagenum2">440</span>
verry mizerabl, if we wer so foolish as to—" Jo paused a litl oever
th last wurd, but Laurie uterd it with a rapcherus expreshon,—</p>

<p>"Marry,—no, we shouldn't! If U luvd me, Jo, I should be a
perfect saent, for U cuud maek me anything U liek."</p>

<p>"No, I can't. I've tried it and faeld, and I wun't risk our hapynes
by such a seerius experriment. We don't agree and we never
shal; so we'll be guud frends all our lievs, but we wun't go and do
anything rash."</p>

<p>"Yes, we wil if we get th chanss," muterd Laurie rebelyusly.</p>

<p>"Now do be reezonabl, and taek a sensibl vue of th caess," implord
Jo, aulmoest at her wit's end.</p>

<p>"I wun't be reezonabl; I don't wont to taek whut U call 'a sensibl
vue;' it wun't help me, and it oenly maeks U harder. I don't
beleev U've got any hart."</p>

<p>"I wish I hadn't!"</p>

<p>Thaer wuz a litl qiver in Jo's vois, and, thinking it a guud oemen,
Laurie turnd round, bringing all his persuasive powers to baer as he
sed, in th wheedlesome toen that had never been so dangerously
wheedlesome befor,—</p>

<p>"Don't disapoint us, deer! Every wun expects it. Grandpa has
set his hart upon it, yuur peepl liek it, and I can't get on without
U. Sae U wil, and let's be hapy. Do, do!"</p>

<p>Not until munths afterward did Jo understand how she had th
strength of miend to hoeld fast to th rezolooshon she had maed when she
desieded that she did not luv her boy, and never cuud. It wuz verry
hard to do, but she did it, noeing that delae wuz boeth uesles and
crooel.</p>

<p>"I can't sae 'Yes' truly, so I wun't sae it at all. U'll see that
I'm riet, by and by, and thank me for it"—she began solemly.</p>

<p>"I'll be hangd if I do!" and Laurie bounst up off th gras,
burning with indignaeshon at th baer iedeea.</p>

<p>"Yes, U wil!" persisted Jo; "U'll get oever this after a whiel,
and fiend sum luvly, accomplished gurl, hoo wil ador U, and
maek a fien mistres for yuur fien hous. I shouldn't. I'm hoemly
and aukward and od and oeld, and U'd be ashamed of me, and
we should qorrel,—we can't help it eeven now, U see,—and I
<span class="pagenum2">441</span>
shouldn't liek elegant soesieety and U wuud, and U'd haet mi
scribling, and I couldn't get on without it, and we should be unhapy,
and wish we hadn't dun it, and everything wuud be horrid!"</p>

<p>"Anything mor?" askt Laurie, fiending it hard to lisen paeshently
to this prophetic burst.</p>

<p>"Nuthing mor, exsept that I don't beleev I shal ever marry.
I'm hapy as I am, and luv mi liberty too wel to be in any hurry
to giv it up for any mortal man."</p>

<p>"I noe beter!" broek in Laurie. "U think so now; but thaer'll
cum a tiem when U <em>wil</em> caer for sumbody, and U'll luv him
tremendously, and liv and die for him. I noe U wil, it's yuur
wae, and I shal hav to stand by and see it;" and th despaering
luver cast his hat upon th ground with a jescher that wuud hav
seemd comikal, if his faess had not been so tragical.</p>

<p>"Yes, I <em>wil</em> liv and die for him, if he ever cums and maeks me
luv him in spiet of mieself, and U must do th best U can!"
cried Jo, loozing paeshenss with puur Teddy. "I've dun mi best, but
U <em>wun't</em> be reezonabl, and it's selfish of U to keep teezing for
whut I can't giv. I shal aulwaes be fond of U, verry fond indeed,
as a frend, but I'll never marry U; and th sooner U beleev it,
th beter for boeth of us,—so now!"</p>

<p>That speech wuz liek fier to gunpowder. Laurie luukt at her a
mienuet as if he did not qiet noe whut to do with himself, then
turnd sharply away, saeing, in a desperat sort of toen,—</p>

<p>"U'll be sorry sum dae, Jo."</p>

<p>"O, whaer ar U going?" she cried, for his faess frietend her.</p>

<p>"To th devil!" wuz th consoeling anser.</p>

<p>For a mienuet Jo's hart stuud still, as he swung himself doun th
bank, tord th river; but it taeks much foly, sin, or mizery to send
a yung man to a vieolent deth, and Laurie wuz not wun of th week
sort hoo ar conkerd by a singgl faeluer. He had no thaut of a
melodramatik plunj, but sum bliend instinkt led him to fling hat and
coet into his boet, and row (noun) away with all his miet, maeking beter
tiem up th river than he had dun in meny a raess. Jo droo a long
breth and unclaspt her hands as she wocht th puur felo trieing
to outstrip th trubl which he carried in his hart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">442</span>
"That wil do him guud, and he'll cum hoem in such a tender,
penitent staet of miend, that I sha'n't daer to see him," she sed; ading,
as she went sloely hoem, feeling as if she had murderd sum
inosent thing, and berryd it under th leevs,—</p>

<p>"Now I must go and prepaer Mr. Laurence to be verry kiend to mi
puur boy. I wish he'd luv Beth; perhaps he mae, in tiem, but I
begin to think I wuz mistaeken about her. O deer! how can gurls liek
to hav luvers and refuez them. I think it's dredful."</p>

<p>Being shuur that no wun cuud do it so wel as herself, she went
straet to Mr. Laurence, toeld th hard story bravely thru, and then
broek doun, crieing so dizmaly oever her oen insensibility that th
kiend oeld jentlman, tho sorly disapointed, did not uter a reproech.
He found it dificult to understand how any gurl cuud help
luving Laurie, and hoept she wuud chaenj her miend, but he knew
eeven beter than Jo that luv cannot be forst, so he shuuk his hed
sadly, and rezolvd to carry his boy out of harm's wae; for Yung
Impechuosity's parting wurds to Jo disturbs him mor than he wuud
confes.</p>

<p>When Laurie caem hoem, ded tierd, but qiet compoezd, his
grandfaather met him as if he knew nuthing, and kept up th deloozhon
verry successfully for an our or too. But when thae sat together in
th twilight, th tiem thae uezd to enjoy so much, it wuz hard wurk for
th oeld man to rambl on as uezhual, and harder still for th yung wun
to lisen to praezes of th last yeer's success, which to him now seemd
luv's laebor lost. He bor it as long as he cuud, then went to his
piano, and began to plae. Th windoes wer oepen; and Jo, wauking
in th garden with Beth, for wunss understuud muezik beter than her
sister, for he plaed th "Sonaata Pathétique," and plaed it as he
never did befor.</p>

<p>"That's verry fien, I daer sae, but it's sad enough to maek wun cri;
giv us sumthing gayer, lad," sed Mr. Laurence, hoos kiend oeld
hart wuz fuul of simpathy, which he longed to sho, but knew not how.</p>

<p>Laurie dasht into a lievlyer straen, plaed stormily for several minits,
and wuud hav got thru bravely, if, in a moementaery lul, Mrs.
March's vois had not been hurd calling,—</p>
<p>"Jo, deer, cum in; I wont U."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">443</span>
Just whut Laurie longed to sae, with a diferent meening! As he
lisend, he lost his plaess; th muezik ended with a broeken cord, and
th muezishan sat silent in th dark.</p>

<p>"I can't stand this," muterd th oeld jentlman. Up he got,
groept his wae to th piano, laed a kiend hand on eether of th braud
shoulders, and sed, as jently as a wuuman,—</p>

<p>"I noe, mi boy, I noe."</p>

<p>No anser for an instant; then Laurie askt sharply,—</p>

<p>"Hoo toeld U?"</p>

<p>"Jo herself."</p>

<p>"Then thaer's an end of it!" and he shuuk off his grandfaather's
hands with an impaeshent moeshon; for, tho graetful for th simpathy,
his man's pride cuud not baer a man's pity.</p>

<p>"Not qiet; I wont to sae wun thing, and then thaer shal be an
end of it," returnd Mr. Laurence, with uenuezhual mieldnes. "U
wun't caer to stae at hoem just now, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"I don't intend to run away from a gurl. Jo can't prevent mi seeing
her, and I shal stae and do it as long as I liek," interupted
Laurie, in a defieant toen.</p>

<p>"Not if U ar th jentlman I think U. I'm disapointed,
but th gurl can't help it; and th oenly thing left for U to do is to
go away for a tiem. Whaer wil U go?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere. I don't caer whut becums of me;" and Laurie got
up, with a rekles laf, that graeted on his grandfaather's eer.</p>

<p>"Taek it liek a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's saek.
Whi not go abraud, as U pland, and forget it?"</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"But U've been wield to go, and I promist U should when
U got thru colej."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I didn't meen to go aloen!" and Laurie waukt fast
thru th room, with an expreshon which it wuz wel his grandfaather
did not see.</p>

<p>"I don't ask U to go aloen; thaer's sum wun redy and glad to
go with U, anywhere in th wurld."</p>

<p>"Hoo, sur?" stoping to lisen.</p>

<p>"Mieself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">444</span>
Laurie caem bak as qikly as he went, and put out his hand, saeing
huskily,—</p>

<p>"I'm a selfish broot; but—U noe—grandfaather—"</p>

<p>"Lord help me, yes, I do noe, for I've been thru it all befor,
wunss in mi oen yung daes, and then with yuur faather. Now, mi
deer boy, just sit qieetly doun, and heer mi plan. It's all setld, and
can be carried out at wunss," sed Mr. Laurence, keeping hoeld of th
yung man, as if feerful that he wuud braek away, as his faather had
dun befor him.</p>

<p>"Wel, sur, whut is it?" and Laurie sat doun, without a sien of interest
in faess or vois.</p>

<p>"Thaer is business in London that needs luuking after; I ment
U should atend to it; but I can do it beter mieself, and things heer
wil get on verry wel with Brooke to manej them. Mi partners do
aulmoest everything; I'm meerly hoelding on till U taek mi plaess, and
can be off at any tiem."</p>

<p>"But U haet travelling, sur; I can't ask it of U at yuur aej," began
Laurie, hoo wuz graetful for th sacrifiess, but much prefurd to
go aloen, if he went at all.</p>

<p>Th oeld jentlman knew that perfectly wel, and particularly dezierd
to prevent it; for th mood in which he found his grandson ashuurd
him that it wuud not be wiez to leev him to his oen devieses. So,
stifling a nacheral regret at th thaut of th hoem cumforts he wuud
leev behind him, he sed stoutly,—</p>

<p>"Bles yuur soel, I'm not superannuated yet. I qiet enjoy th
iedeea; it wil do me guud, and mi oeld bones wun't sufer, for travelling
nowadaes is aulmoest as eezy as sitting in a chaer."</p>

<p>A restles moovment from Laurie sugjested that <em>his</em> chaer wuz not eezy,
or that he did not liek th plan, and maed th oeld man ad haestily,—</p>

<p>"I don't meen to be a marplot or a burden; I go because I think
U'd feel hapyer than if I wuz left behind. I don't intend to gad
about with U, but leev U free to go whaer U liek, whiel I amuez
mieself in mi oen wae. I've frends in London and Paris, and
should liek to vizit them; meentiem U can go to Italy, Germany,
Switzerland, whaer U wil, and enjoy pikchers, muezik, seenery, and
advenchers to yuur hart's content."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">445</span>
Now, Laurie felt just then that his hart wuz entierly broeken, and
th wurld a houling wildernes; but at th sound of surten wurds
which th oeld jentlman artfuly introduest into his cloezing sentenss,
th broeken hart gaev an unexpekted leep, and a green oeaesis or too
sudenly apeerd in th houling wildernes. He sighed, and then
sed, in a spiritles toen,—</p>

<p>"Just as U liek, sur; it doesn't mater whaer I go or whut
I do."</p>

<p>"It duz to me, remember that, mi lad; I giv U entier liberty,
but I trust U to maek an onest uez of it. Promis me that,
Laurie."</p>

<p>"Anything U liek, sur."</p>

<p>"Guud," thaut th oeld jentlman. "U don't caer now, but
thaer'll cum a tiem when that promis wil keep U out of mischif,
or I'm much mistaeken."</p>

<p>Being an enerjetik indivijual, Mr. Laurence struk whiel th ieern
wuz hot; and befor th blieted being recuverd spirit enough to
rebl, thae wer off. Duuring th tiem nesesaery for preparaeshon,
Laurie bor himself as yung jentlmen uezhualy do in such caeses.
He wuz moody, iritabl, and pensiv by turns; lost his apetiet, neglekted
his dres, and devoeted much tiem to plaeing tempestuously on
his piano; avoided Jo, but consoeld himself by staering at her from
his windo, with a tragical faess that haunted her dreems by niet,
and oprest her with a hevy senss of guilt by dae. Unliek sum
suferers, he never spoek of his unreqieted pashon, and wuud alow
no wun, not eeven Mrs. March, to atempt consolaeshon or ofer simpathy.
On sum accounts, this wuz a releef to his frends; but th
weeks befor his deparcher wer verry uncumfortabl, and every wun
rejoist that th "puur, deer felo wuz going away to forget his
trubl, and cum hoem hapy." Of corss, he smield darkly at thaer
deloozhon, but past it by, with th sad superiority of wun hoo knew
that his fiedelity, liek his luv, wuz unaulterabl.</p>

<p>When th parting caem he affected hie spirits, to conceal surten
inconveeni’ent emotions which seemd inclined to assert themselvs.
This gaeety did not impoez upon anybody, but thae tried to luuk as
if it did, for his saek, and he got on verry wel till Mrs. March kist
<span class="pagenum2">446</span>
him, with a whisper fuul of mutherly solisitued; then, feeling that he
wuz going verry fast, he haestily embraced them all round, not forgeting
th aflikted Hannah, and ran dounstaers as if for his lief. Jo foloed
a mienuet after to waev her hand to him if he luukt round.
He did luuk round, caem bak, put his arms about her, as she stuud
on th step abuv him, and luukt up at her with a faess that maed
his short apeel boeth eloquent and pathetik.</p>

<p>"O Jo, can't U?"</p>

<p>"Teddy, deer, I wish I cuud!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">447</span>
That wuz all, exsept a litl pause; then Laurie straetend himself
up, sed "It's all riet, never miend," and went away without anuther
wurd. Ah, but it wasn't all riet, and Jo <em>did</em> miend; for whiel th
curly hed lae on her arm a mienuet after her hard anser, she felt as
if she had stabd her deerest frend; and when he left her without
a luuk behind him, she knew that th boy Laurie never wuud cum
again.</p>

<p class="h2a">BETH'S Seecret.</p>

<p><span class="smc">When</span> Jo caem hoem that spring, she had been struk with th
chaenj in Beth. No wun spoek of it or seemd aware of it, for it had
cum too grajualy to startl thoes hoo saw her daily; but to ies
sharpend by absence, it wuz verry plaen; and a hevy waet fel on
Jo's hart as she saw her sister's faess. It wuz no paler and but litl
thiner than in th autumn; yet thaer wuz a straenj, transpaerent
luuk about it, as if th mortal wuz being sloely refiend away, and th
immortal shiening thru th frael flesh with an indescriebably pathetik
buety. Jo saw and felt it, but sed nuthing at th tiem, and soon th
furst impreshon lost much of its power; for Beth seemd hapy, no
wun apeerd to dout that she wuz beter; and, prezently, in uther
caers, Jo for a tiem forgot her feer.</p>

<p>But when Laurie wuz gon, and peess prevaeld again, th vaeg
anxiety returnd and haunted her. She had confest her sins and
been forgiven; but when she shoed her saevings and propoezd th
mounten trip, Beth had thankt her hartily, but begd not to go
so far away from hoem. Anuther litl vizit to th seeshor wuud
suit her beter, and, as grandmaa cuud not be prevaeld upon to leev
th baebys, Jo tuuk Beth doun to th qieet plaess, whaer she cuud
liv much in th oepen aer, and let th fresh see-breezes blo a litl
culor into her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>It wuz not a fashonabl plaess, but, eeven amung th plezant peepl
thaer, th gurls maed fue frends, prefuring to liv for wun anuther.
Beth wuz too shi to enjoy soesieety, and Jo too rapt up in her to caer
for any wun else; so thae wer all in all to eech uther, and caem and
went, qiet unconshus of th interest thae exsieted in thoes about
<span class="pagenum2">449</span>
them, hoo wocht with simpathetik ies th strong sister and th
feebl wun, aulwaes together, as if thae felt instinktivly that a long
separaeshon wuz not far away.</p>

<p>Thae did feel it, yet neether spoek of it; for ofen between ourselvs
and thoes neerest and deerest to us thaer exists a rezurv which
it is verry hard to oevercum. Jo felt as if a vael had faulen between her
hart and Beth's; but when she put out her hand to lift it up, thaer
seemd sumthing saecred in th silence, and she waeted for Beth to
speek. She wunderd, and wuz thankful aulso, that her paerents did
not seem to see whut she saw; and, duuring th qieet weeks, when th
shado groo so plaen to her, she sed nuthing of it to thoes at hoem,
beleeving that it wuud tel itself when Beth caem bak no beter. She
wunderd still mor if her sister reealy guessed th hard trooth, and
whut thoughts wer pasing thru her miend duuring th long ours
when she lae on th worm roks, with her hed in Jo's lap, whiel th
wiends blew helthfuly oever her, and th see maed muezik at her feet.</p>

</div>

<p>Wun dae Beth toeld her. Jo thaut she wuz asleep, she lae so still;
and, putting doun her book, sat luuking at her with wistful ies, trieing
to see siens of hoep in th faent culor on Beth's cheeks. But she
cuud not fiend enough to satisfi her, for th cheeks wer verry thin,
and th hands seemd too feebl to hoeld eeven th roezy litl shels
thae had been gathering. It caem to her then mor biterly than ever
that Beth wuz sloely drifting away from her, and her arms instinktivly
tightened thaer hoeld upon th deerest treasure she possessed. For
a mienuet her ies wer too dim for seeing, and, when thae cleerd,
Beth wuz luuking up at her so tenderly that thaer wuz hardly any need
for her to sae,—</p>

<p>"Jo, deer, I'm glad U noe it. I've tried to tel U, but I
couldn't."</p>

<p>Thaer wuz no anser exsept her sister's cheek against her oen,
not eeven teers; for when moest deeply moovd, Jo did not cri. She wuz
th weeker, then, and Beth tried to cumfort and sustaen her, with her
arms about her, and th soothing wurds she whisperd in her eer.</p>

<p>"I've noen it for a guud whiel, deer, and, now I'm uezd to it, it
isn't hard to think of or to baer. Tri to see it so, and don't be
trubld about me, because it's best; indeed it is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">450</span>
"Is this whut maed U so unhapy in th autumn, Beth? U
did not feel it then, and keep it to yuurself so long, did U?" askt
Jo, refuezing to see or sae that it <em>wuz</em> best, but glad to noe that Laurie
had no part in Beth's trubl.</p>

<p>"Yes, I gaev up hoeping then, but I didn't liek to oen it. I tried to
think it wuz a sik fansy, and wuud not let it trubl any wun. But
when I saw U all so wel and strong, and fuul of hapy plans, it
wuz hard to feel that I cuud never be liek U, and then I wuz mizerabl,
Jo."</p>

<p>"O Beth, and U didn't tel me, didn't let me cumfort and help
U! How cuud U shut me out, and baer it all aloen?"</p>

<p>Jo's vois wuz fuul of tender reproech, and her hart aekt to think
of th solitaery strugl that must hav gon on whiel Beth lurnd to
sae guud-by to helth, luv, and lief, and taek up her cros so cheerfuly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it wuz rong, but I tried to do riet; I wasn't shuur,
no wun sed anything, and I hoept I wuz mistaeken. It wuud hav
been selfish to frieten U all when Marmee wuz so anxious about
Meg, and Amy away, and U so hapy with Laurie,—at leest, I
thaut so then."</p>

<p>"And I thaut that U luvd him, Beth, and I went away because
I couldn't," cried Jo, glad to sae all th trooth.</p>

<p>Beth luukt so amaezd at th iedeea that Jo smield in spiet of
her paen, and aded softly,—</p>

<p>"Then U didn't, deary? I wuz afraed it wuz so, and imajind
yuur puur litl hart fuul of luv-lornity all that whiel."</p>

<p>"Whi, Jo, how cuud I, when he wuz so fond of U?" askt Beth,
as inosently as a chield. "I do luv him deerly; he is so guud to
me, how can I help it? But he never cuud be anything to me but
mi bruther. I hoep he truly wil be, sumtiem."</p>

<p>"Not thru me," sed Jo decidedly. "Amy is left for him, and
thae wuud suit exselently; but I hav no hart for such things,
now. I don't caer whut becums of anybody but U, Beth. U
<em>must</em> get wel."</p>

<p>"I wont to, o, so much! I tri, but every dae I looz a litl, and
feel mor shuur that I shal never gaen it bak. It's liek th tied, Jo,
when it turns, it goes sloely, but it can't be stopt."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">451</span>
"It <em>shal</em> be stopt, yuur tied must not turn so soon, nienteen 
is too yung. Beth,  <ins title="Add period after let you go"> 
I can't let U go.</ins> I'll wurk and prae and fiet
against it. I'll keep U in spiet of everything; thaer must be waes,
it can't be too laet. God wun't be so crooel as to taek U from me,"
cried puur Jo rebelyusly, for her spirit wuz far les piously submissive
than Beth's.</p>

<p>Simpl, sincere peepl seldom speek much of thaer piety; it
shoes itself in akts, rather than in wurds, and has mor inflooenss
than homilys or protestations. Beth cuud not reezon upon or explaen
th faeth that gaev her curej and paeshenss to giv up lief, and
cheerfuly waet for deth. Liek a confieding chield, she askt no
qeschons, but left everything to God and naechuur, Faather and muther
of us all, feeling shuur that thae, and thae oenly, cuud teech and
strengthen hart and spirit for this lief and th lief to cum. She did
not rebuek Jo with saently speeches, oenly luvd her beter for her
pashonat affection, and clung mor cloesly to th deer hueman luv,
from which our Faather never means us to be weend, but thru
which He draws us cloeser to Himself. She cuud not sae, "I'm glad
to go," for lief wuz verry sweet to her; she cuud oenly sob out, "I tri
to be wiling," whiel she held fast to Jo, as th furst biter waev of
this graet sorro broek oever them together.</p>

<p>By and by Beth sed, with recuverd serenity,—</p>

<p>"U'll tel them this when we go hoem?"</p>

<p>"I think thae wil see it without wurds," sighed Jo; for now it
seemd to her that Beth chaenjd every dae.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; I've hurd that th peepl hoo luv best ar ofen
bliendest to such things. If thae don't see it, U wil tel them for
me. I don't wont any seecrets, and it's kiender to prepaer them.
Meg has John and th baebys to cumfort her, but U must stand by
faather and muther, wun't U, Jo?"</p>

<p>"If I can; but, Beth, I don't giv up yet; I'm going to beleev
that it <em>is</em> a sik fansy, and not let U think it's troo," sed Jo, trieing
to speek cheerfuly.</p>

<p>Beth lae a mienuet thinking, and then sed in her qieet wae,—</p>

<p>"I don't noe how to expres mieself, and shouldn't tri, to any wun
but U, because I can't speek out, exsept to mi Jo. I oenly meen
<span class="pagenum2">452</span>
to sae that I hav a feeling that it never wuz intended I should
liv long. I'm not liek th rest of U; I never maed any plans
about whut I'd do when I groo up; I never thaut of being marryd,
as U all did. I couldn't seem to imajin mieself anything but
stoopid litl Beth, troting about at hoem, of no uez anywhere but
thaer. I never wontedw to go away, and th hard part now is th leeving
U all. I'm not afraed, but it seems as if I should be hoemsik
for U eeven in heven."</p>

<p>Jo cuud not speek; and for several minits thaer wuz no sound
but th sie of th wiend and th laping of th tied. A whiet-wingd
gul floo by, with th flash of sunshine on its silvery breast; Beth
wocht it till it vanisht, and her ies wer fuul of sadnes. A litl
grae-coeted sand-burd caem triping oever th beech, "peeping" softly
to itself, as if enjoying th sun and see; it caem qiet cloez to Beth,
luukt at her with a frendly ie, and sat upon a worm stoen, dresing
its wet fethers, qiet at hoem. Beth smield, and felt cumforted, for
th tieny thing seemd to ofer its small frendship, and remiend her
that a plezant wurld wuz still to be enjoyd.</p>

<p>"Deer litl burd! See, Jo, how taem it is. I liek peeps beter
than th guls: thae ar not so wield and handsum, but thae seem
hapy, confieding litl things. I uezd to call them mi burds, last
sumer; and muther sed thae remiended her of me,—busy, quaker-culord
creechers, aulwaes neer th shor, and aulwaes churping that
contented litl song of theirs. U ar th gul, Jo, strong and wield,
fond of th storm and th wiend, flieing far out to see, and hapy all
aloen. Meg is th turtle-duv, and Amy is liek th lark she riets
about, trieing to get up amung th clouds, but aulwaes droping doun
into its nest again. Deer litl gurl! she's so ambishus, but her hart
is guud and tender; and no mater how hie she flies, she never wil
forget hoem. I hoep I shal see her again, but she seems <em>so</em> far
away."</p>

<p>"She is cuming in th spring, and I meen that U shal be all
redy to see and enjoy her. I'm going to hav U wel and roezy by
that tiem," began Jo, feeling that of all th chaenjes in Beth, th tauking
chaenj wuz th graetest, for it seemd to cost no efort now, and
she thaut aloud in a wae qiet unliek bashful Beth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">453</span>
"Jo, deer, don't hoep any mor; it wun't do any guud, I'm shuur of
that. We wun't be mizerabl, but enjoy being together whiel we waet.
We'll hav hapy times, for I don't sufer much, and I think th tied
wil go out eezily, if U help me."</p>

<p>Jo leend doun to kis th tranquil faess; and with that silent kis,
she dedicated herself soel and body to Beth.</p>

<p>She wuz riet: thaer wuz no need of any wurds when thae got
hoem, for faather and muther saw plainly, now, whut thae had praed
to be saevd from seeing. Tierd with her short jurny, Beth went at
wunss to bed, saeing how glad she wuz to be at hoem; and when Jo
went doun, she found that she wuud be spaerd th hard task of teling
Beth's seecret. Her faather stuud leening his hed on th mantel-peess,
and did not turn as she caem in; but her muther strecht
out her arms as if for help, and Jo went to cumfort her without a
wurd.</p>

<p class="h2a">Nue Impreshons.</p>

<p><span class="smc">At</span> three o'clok in th afternoon, all th fashonabl wurld at
Niess mae be seen on th Promenade des Anglais,—a charming plaess;
for th wied wauk, bordered with paams, flowers, and tropikaly shrubs,
is bounded on wun sied by th see, on th uther by th grand driev,
liend with hoetels and vilas, whiel beyond lie orenj-orchards and th
hils. Meny naeshons ar reprezented, meny langgwejes spoeken, meny
costumes worn; and, on a suny dae, th spektakl is as gae and
brilliant as a carnival. Hauty English, lievly French, soeber Germans,
handsum Spaniards, ugly Russians, meek Jews, free-and-eezy
Americans, all driev, sit, or saunter heer, chating oever th nues, and
criticising th laetest selebrity hoo has arrived,—Ristori or Dickens,
Viktor Emmanuel or th Qeen of th Sandwich Ielands. Th equipages
ar as vaeryd as th company, and atrakt as much atenshon, especially
th loe basket-barouches in which laedys driev themselvs,
with a paer of dashing ponies, gae nets to keep thaer volueminus
<span class="pagenum2">455</span>
flounses from oeverfloeing th diminuetiv veeikls, and litl grooms
on th purch behind.</p>

<p>Along this wauk, on Christmas Dae, a taul yung man waukt sloely,
with his hands behind him, and a sumwhot absent expreshon of
countenanss. He luukt liek an Italian, wuz drest liek an Englishman,
and had th independent aer of an American,—a combinaeshon
which cauzd sundry paers of feminine ies to luuk approvingly after
him, and sundry dandies in blak velvet suits, with roez-culord nekties,
buff gluvs, and orenj-flowers in thaer buton-hoels, to shrug
thaer shoulders, and then envy him his inches. Thaer wer plenty of
prity faeses to admier, but th yung man tuuk litl noetis of them,
exsept to glanss, now and then, at sum blonde gurl, or laedy in bloo.
Prezently he stroeld out of th promenade, and stuud a moement at
th crosing, as if undecided whether to go and lisen to th band in
th Jardin Publique, or to waander along th beech tord Casl Hil.
Th qik trot of ponies' feet maed him luuk up, as wun of th litl
carrejs, containing a singgl laedy, caem rapidly doun th street. Th
laedy wuz yung, blonde, and drest in bloo. He staerd a mienuet,
then his hoel faess woek up, and, waeving his hat liek a boy, he huryd
forward to meet her.</p>

<p>"O Laurie, is it reealy U? I thaut U'd never cum!"
cried Amy, droping th raens, and hoelding out boeth hands, to th
graet scandalization of a French maama, hoo haesnd her dauter's
steps, lest she should be demoraliezed by behoelding th free maners
of thees "mad English."</p>

<p>"I wuz detaend by th wae, but I promist to spend Christmas
with U, and heer I am."</p>

<p>"How is yuur grandfaather? When did U cum? Whaer ar
U staeing?"</p>

<p>"Verry wel—last niet—at th Chauvain. I called at yuur hoetel,
but U wer all out."</p>

<p>"I hav so much to sae, I don't noe whaer to begin! Get in,
and we can tauk at our eez; I wuz going for a driev, and longing for
company. Flo's saeving up for to-niet."</p>

<p>"Whut happens then, a baul?"</p>

<p>"A Christmas party at our hoetel. Thaer ar meny Americans
<span class="pagenum2">456</span>
thaer, and thae giv it in onor of th dae. U'll go with us, of
corss? Ant wil be charmd."</p>

<p>"Thank U. Whaer now?" askt Laurie, leening bak and foelding
his arms, a proceeding which suited Amy, hoo prefurd to driev;
for her parasol-whip and bloo raens oever th whiet ponies' baks, afforded
her infinit satisfakshon.</p>

<p>"I'm going to th banker's furst, for leters, and then to Casl
Hil; th vue is so luvly, and I liek to feed th peacocks. Hav
U ever been thaer?"</p>

<p>"Ofen, yeers ago; but I don't miend having a luuk at it."</p>

<p>"Now tel me all about yuurself. Th last I hurd of U, yuur
grandfaather roet that he expected U from Berlin."</p>

<p>"Yes, I spent a munth thaer, and then joind him in Paris, whaer
he has setld for th winter. He has frends thaer, and fiends plenty
to amuez him; so I go and cum, and we get on capitally."</p>

<p>"That's a soeshabl araenjment," sed Amy, mising sumthing in
Laurie's maner, tho she couldn't tel whut.</p>

<p>"Whi, U see he haets to travel, and I haet to keep still; so we
eech suit ourselvs, and thaer is no trubl. I am ofen with him,
and he enjoys mi advenchers, whiel I liek to feel that sum wun is glad
to see me when I get bak from mi waanderings. Durty oeld hoel, isn't
it?" he aded, with a luuk of disgust, as thae droev along th boulevard
to th Plaess Napoleon, in th oeld sity.</p>

<p>"Th durt is picturesque, so I don't miend. Th river and th hils
ar delicious, and thees glimpses of th narro cros-streets ar mi
deliet. Now we shal hav to waet for that procession to pas; it's
going to th Church of St. John."</p>

<p>Whiel Laurie listlesly wocht th procession of preests under
thaer canopys, whiet-vaeld nuns bearing lieted taepers, and sum
brutherhuud in bloo, chanting as thae waukt, Amy wocht him, and
felt a nue sort of shienes steal oever her; for he wuz chaenjd, and she
cuud not fiend th merry-faest boy she left in th moody-luuking
man besied her. He wuz hansumer than ever, and graetly improovd,
she thaut; but now that th flush of plezher at meeting her wuz
oever, he luukt tierd and spiritles,—not sik, nor exaktly unhapy,
but oelder and graever than a yeer or too of prosperous lief should hav
<span class="pagenum2">457</span>
maed him. She couldn't understand it, and did not venture to ask
qeschons; so she shuuk her hed, and tucht up her ponies, as th
procession woond away acros th arches of th Paglioni bridge, and
vanisht in th church.</p>

<p>"<i>Que pensez vous</i>?" she sed, aering her French, which had improovd
in qontity, if not in qolity, sinss she caem abraud.</p>

<p>"That mademezel has maed guud uez of her tiem, and th rezult
is charming," replied Laurie, bowing, with his hand on his hart, and
an admiering luuk.</p>

<p>She blushed with plezher, but sumhow th compliment did not
satisfi her liek th blunt praezes he uezd to giv her at hoem, when he
promenaded round her on festival ocaezhons, and toeld her she wuz
"aultogether joly," with a harty smiel and an aprooving pat on th
hed. She didn't liek th nue toen; for, tho not <i>blasé</i>, 
it sounded indiferent in spiet of th luuk.</p>

<p>"If that's th wae he's going to gro up, I wish he'd stae a boy,"
she thaut, with a cuerius senss of disapointment and discumfort,
trieing meentiem to seem qiet eezy and gae.</p>

<p>At Avigdor's she found th precious hoem-leters, and, giving th
raens to Laurie, red them lugzhuriusly as thae woond up th shaedy
roed between green hejes, whaer tee-roezes bloomd as freshly as in
June.</p>

<p>"Beth is verry poorly, muther sez. I ofen think I aut to go
hoem, but thae all sae 'stae;' so I do, for I shal never hav anuther
chanss liek this," sed Amy, luuking soeber oever wun paej.</p>

<p>"I think U ar riet, thaer; U cuud do nuthing at hoem, and
it is a graet cumfort to them to noe that U ar wel and hapy, and
enjoying so much, mi deer."</p>

<p>He droo a litl neerer, and luukt mor liek his oeld self, as he sed
that; and th feer that sumtiems waed on Amy's hart wuz lietend,
for th luuk, th akt, th brutherly "mi deer," seemd to ashuur
her that if any trubl did cum, she wuud not be aloen in a straenj
land. Prezently she laft, and shoed him a small skech of Jo in
her scribling-suit, with th boe rampantly erekt upon her cap, and
ishooing from her mouth th wurds, "Jeenyus burns!"</p>

<p>Laurie smield, tuuk it, put it in his vest-poket, "to keep it from
<span class="pagenum2">458</span>
bloeing away," and lisend with interest to th lievly leter Amy red
him.</p>

<p>"This wil be a reguelarly merry Christmas to me, with prezents in
th morning, U and leters in th afternoon, and a party at niet,"
sed Amy, as thae alieted amung th rooins of th oeld fort, and a flok
of splendid peacocks caem trooping about them, tamely waeting to be
fed. Whiel Amy stuud lafing on th bank abuv him as she scaterd
crums to th brilliant burds, Laurie luukt at her as she had
luukt at him, with a nacheral cueriosity to see whut chaenjes tiem and
absence had raut. He found nuthing to perplex or disapoint,
much to admier and aproov; for, oeverluuking a fue litl affectations
of speech and maner, she wuz as sprietly and graesful as ever, with
th adishon of that indescriebabl sumthing in dres and bearing which
we call eleganss. Aulwaes matuur for her aej, she had gaend a surten
<i>aplum</i> in boeth carrej and conversation, which maed her seem
mor of a wuuman of th wurld than she wuz; but her oeld petulance
now and then shoed itself, her strong wil still held its oen, and her
naetiv franknes wuz unspoiled by forin polish.</p>

<p>Laurie did not red all this whiel he wocht her feed th peacocks,
but he saw enough to satisfi and interest him, and carried away a
prity litl pikcher of a briet-faest gurl standing in th sunshine,
which brought out th soft hue of her dres, th fresh culor of her
cheeks, th goelden glos of her haer, and maed her a prominent figuer
in th plezant seen.</p>

<p>As thae caem up on to th stoen plateau that crouns th hil, Amy
waevd her hand as if welcuming him to her faevorit haunt, and sed,
pointing heer and thaer,—</p>

<p>"Do U remember th Catheedral and th Corso, th fishermen
draging thaer nets in th bae, and th luvly roed to Vila Franca,
Schubert's Tower, just beloe, and, best of all, that spek far out to
see which thae sae is Corsica?"</p>

<p>"I remember; it's not much chaenjd," he anserd, without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Whut Jo wuud giv for a siet of that faemus spek!" sed
Amy, feeling in guud spirits, and anxious to see him so aulso.</p>

<p>"Yes," wuz all he sed, but he turnd and straend his ies to see
<span class="pagenum2">459</span>
th ieland which a graeter uesurper than eeven Napoleon now maed
interesting in his siet.</p>

<p>"Taek a guud luuk at it for her saek, and then cum and tel me
whut U hav been dooing with yuurself all this whiel," sed Amy,
seeting herself, redy for a guud tauk.</p>

<p>But she did not get it; for, tho he joind her, and anserd
all her qeschons freely, she cuud oenly lurn that he had roevd about
th continent and been to Greece. So, after iedling away an our,
thae droev hoem again; and, having paed his respekts to Mrs. Carrol,
Laurie left them, promising to return in th evening.</p>

<p>It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberatly "prinked" that
niet. Tiem and absence had dun its wurk on boeth th yung peepl;
she had seen her oeld frend in a nue liet, not as "our boy,"
but as a handsum and agreeabl man, and she wuz conshus of a
verry nacheral dezier to fiend faevor in his siet. Amy knew her guud
points, and maed th moest of them, with th taest and skil which is
a forchun to a puur and prity wuuman.</p>

<p>Tarlatan and tulle wer cheep at Niess, so she enveloped herself in
them on such ocaezhons, and, foloeing th sensibl English fashon of
simpl dres for yung gurls, got up charming litl toilettes with fresh
flowers, a fue trinkets, and all maner of dainty devieses, which wer
boeth inexpensiv and efektiv. It must be confest that th artist
sumtiems got possession of th wuuman, and induljd in anteek
<i>coiffures</i>, statuesque atitoods, and classic draeperys. But, deer hart,
we all hav our litl weekneses, and fiend it eezy to pardon such in
th yung, hoo satisfi our ies with thaer comeliness, and keep our
harts merry with thaer artles vanitys.</p>

<p>"I do wont him to think I luuk wel, and tel them so at hoem,"
sed Amy to herself, as she put on Flo's oeld whiet silk baul-dres, and
cuverd it with a cloud of fresh iloozhon, out of which her whiet
shoulders and goelden hed emerged with a moest artistik efekt. Her
haer she had th senss to let aloen, after gathering up th thik waevs
and curls into a Hebe-liek not at th bak of her hed.</p>

<p>"It's not th fashon, but it's becuming, and I can't afford to
maek a friet of mieself," she uezd to sae, when advised to frizl, puff,
or braed, as th laetest stiel comanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">460</span>
Having no ornaments fien enough for this important ocaezhon, Amy
loopt her fleesy scurts with roezy clusters of azalea, and fraemd th
whiet shoulders in delicat green viens. Remembering th paented
boots, she survaed her whiet satin slipers with gurlish satisfakshon,
and <i>chasséed</i> doun th room, admiering her aristocratic feet all by
herself.</p>

<p>"Mi nue fan just maches mi flowers, mi gluvs fit to a charm,
and th reeal laess on ant's <i>mouchoir</i> givs an aer to mi hoel dres.
If I oenly had a classical noez and mouth I should be perfectly hapy,"
she sed, survaeing herself with a critikal ie, and a candle in
eech hand.</p>

<p>In spiet of this aflikshon, she luukt unuezhualy gae and graesful as
she glieded away; she seldom ran,—it did not suit her stiel, she
thaut, for, being taul, th stately and Junoesque wuz mor aproepriat
than th sportive or piquante. She waukt up and doun th
long saloon whiel waeting for Laurie, and wunss araenjd herself under
th shandeleer, which had a guud efekt upon her haer; then she
thaut beter of it, and went away to th uther end of th room,
as if ashamed of th gurlish dezier to hav th furst vue a propitious
wun. It so happened that she cuud not hav dun a beter thing,
for Laurie caem in so qieetly she did not heer him; and, as she
stuud at th distant windo, with her hed haf turnd, and wun
hand gathering up her dres, th slender, whiet figuer against th red
curtens wuz as efektiv as a wel-plaest stachoo.</p>

<p>"Guud evening, Diana!" sed Laurie, with th luuk of satisfakshon
she liked to see in his ies when thae rested on her.</p>

<p>"Guud evening, Apollo!" she anserd, smieling bak at him, for
he, too, luukt unuezhualy <i>debonnaire</i>, and th thaut of entering th
baul-room on th arm of such a personable man cauzd Amy to pity
th foer plaen Mises Davis from th bottom of her hart.</p>

<p>"Heer ar yuur flowers; I araenjd them mieself, remembering
that U didn't liek whut Hannah calls a 'sot-bookay,'" sed Laurie,
handing her a delicat noezgae, in a hoelder that she had long
cuveted as she daily past it in Cardiglia's windo.</p>

<p>"How kiend U ar!" she exclaemd graetfuly. "If I'd noen
U wer cuming I'd hav had sumthing redy for U to-dae,
tho not as prity as this, I'm afraed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">461</span>
"Thank U; it isn't whut it should be, but U hav improovd
it," he aded, as she snapt th silver braeslet on her rists.</p>

<p>"Pleez don't."</p>

<p>"I thaut U liked that sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"Not from U; it doesn't sound nacheral, and I liek yuur oeld
bluntness beter."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it," he anserd, with a luuk of releef; then butond
her gluvs for her, and askt if his tie wuz straet, just as
he uezd to do when thae went to partys together, at hoem.</p>

<p>Th company asembld in th long <i>salle à maenjer</i>, 
that evening, wuz such as wun sees no-whaer but on th Continent. Th
hospitabl Americans had invieted every aqaentanss thae had in
Niess, and, having no prejudis against tietls, secuerd a fue to ad
lustre to thaer Christmas baul.</p>

<p>A Russian prinss condescended to sit in a corner for an our,
and tauk with a masiv laedy, drest liek Hamlet's muther, in blak
velvet, with a pearl bridle under her chin. A Polish count, aejd
<span class="pagenum2">462</span>
aeteen, devoeted himself to th laedys, hoo pronounced him "a
fasinaeting deer," and a German Sereen Sumthing, having cum
for th super aloen, roemd vaegly about, seeking whut he miet
devour. Baron Rothschild's private secretaery, a larj-noezd Jew,
in tight boots, affably beemd upon th wurld, as if his master's
naem cround him with a goelden haelo; a stout Frenchman, hoo
knew th Emperor, caem to indulj his maenia for dansing, and
Laedy de Jones, a British maetron, adornd th seen with her litl
family of aet. Of corss, thaer wer meny liet-fuuted, shril-voist
American gurls, handsum, liefles-luuking English ditto, and
a fue plaen but piquante French demoiselles; liekwiez th uezhual
set of travelling yung jentlmen, hoo disported themselvs gaely,
whiel maamas of all naeshons liend th wauls, and smield upon them
benignly when thae danst with thaer dauters.</p>

<p>Any yung gurl can imajin Amy's staet of miend when she "tuuk
th staej" that niet, leening on Laurie's arm. She knew she luukt
wel, she luvd to danss, she felt that her fuut wuz on her naetiv heeth
in a baul-room, and enjoyd th delietful senss of power which cums
when yung gurls furst discuver th nue and luvly kingdom thae ar
born to rool by vurchoo of buety, yooth, and wuumanhuud. She did
pity th Davis gurls, hoo wer aukward, plaen, and destitoot of escort,
exsept a grim papa and three grimer maeden aunts, and she bowd
to them in her frendlyest maner as she past; which wuz guud of
her, as it permited them to see her dres, and burn with cueriosity to
noe hoo her distingwhisht-luuking frend miet be. With th furst
burst of th band, Amy's culor roez, her ies began to sparkl, and
her feet to tap th flor impaeshently; for she danst wel, and wontedw
Laurie to noe it: thaerfor th shok she reseevd can beter be imajind
than descriebd, when he sed, in a perfectly tranquil toen,—</p>

<p>"Do U caer to danss?"</p>

<p>"Wun uezhualy duz at a baul."</p>

<p>Her amaezd luuk and qik anser cauzd Laurie to repaer his
error as fast as posibl.</p>

<p>"I ment th furst danss. Mae I hav th onor?"</p>

<p>"I can giv U wun if I put off th Count. He danses divinely;
but he wil excuez me, as U ar an oeld frend," sed Amy, hoeping
<span class="pagenum2">463</span>
that th naem wuud hav a guud efekt, and sho Laurie that she
wuz not to be trifled with.</p>

<p>"Niess litl boy, but rather a short Poel to suport</p>

<div class="poem1">
<p class="indent30 left-indent10">
   "'A dauter of th gods,</p>
<p class="indent25 left-indent10">
       Divinely taul, and moest divinely faer,'"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">wuz all th satisfakshon she got, however.</p>

<p>Th set in which thae found themselvs wuz compoezd of English,
and Amy wuz compeld to wauk decorusly thru a cotillon, feeling
all th whiel as if she cuud danss th Taranchula with a relish. Laurie
reziend her to th "niess litl boy," and went to do his duty to Flo,
without secuering Amy for th joys to cum, which reprehensibl wont
of forthaut wuz properly punisht, for she imeediatly engaejd
herself till super, meening to relent if he then gaev any siens of
penitenss. She shoed him her baul-book with demure satisfakshon
when he stroeld, insted of rushing, up to claem her for th next, a
glorius polka-redowa; but his poliet regrets didn't impoez upon her,
and when she gallopaded away with th Count, she saw Laurie sit
doun by her ant with an akchual expreshon of releef.</p>

<p>That wuz unpardonable; and Amy tuuk no mor noetis of him for
a long whiel, exsept a wurd now and then, when she caem to her
shaperoen, between th danses, for a nesesaery pin or a moement's rest.
Her angger had a guud efekt, however, for she hid it under a smieling
faess, and seemd unuezhualy blithe and brilliant. Laurie's ies foloed
her with plezher, for she neether rompt nor saunterd, but
danst with spirit and graess, maeking th delightsome pastime whut it
should be. He verry nacheraly fel to studying her from this nue pointer
of vue; and, befor th evening wuz haf oever, had desieded that "litl
Amy wuz going to maek a verry charming wuuman."</p>

<p>It wuz a lievly seen, for soon th spirit of th soeshal seezon tuuk
possession of every wun, and Christmas merriment maed all faeses
shien, harts hapy, and heels liet. Th muezishans fiddled, tooted,
and bangd as if thae enjoyd it; everybody danst hoo cuud, and
thoes hoo couldn't admierd thaer naebors with uncomon warmth.
Th aer wuz dark with Davises, and meny Joneses gambold liek a
flok of yung jirafs. Th goelden secretaery darted thru th
<span class="pagenum2">464</span>
room liek a meetior, with a dashing Frenchwoman, hoo carpeted th
flor with her pink satin traen. Th Sereen Teuton found th super-taebl,
and wuz hapy, eating steadily thru th bil of faer, and dismaed
th <i>garçons</i> by th ravejes he comited. But th Emperor's
frend cuverd himself with glory, for he danst everything, whether he
knew it or not, and introduest impromptoo pirouettes when th figuers
bewildered him. Th boyish abandon of that stout man wuz charming
to behoeld; for, tho he "carried waet," he danst liek an
india-ruber baul. He ran, he floo, he pranst; his faess gloed, his
bauld hed shone; his coet-taels waevd wieldly, his pumps akchualy
twinkled in th aer, and when th muezik stopt, he wiept th drops
from his brow, and beemd upon his felo-men liek a French Pickwick
without glases.</p>

<p>Amy and her Poel distingwhisht themselvs by equal enthusiasm,
but mor graesful ajility; and Laurie found himself involuntarrily
keeping tiem to th rithmik riez and faul of th whiet slipers as
thae floo by as indefatigably as if wingd. When litl Vladimir
fienaly relinqisht her, with assurances that he wuz "desolated to
leev so eerly," she wuz redy to rest, and see how her recriant niet
had borne his punishment.</p>

<p>It had been successful; for, at three-and-twenty, blieted affections
fiend a balm in frendly soesieety, and yung nerves wil thril, yung
blud danss, and helthy yung spirits riez, when subjekted to th
enchantment of buety, liet, muezik, and moeshon. Laurie had a
waekt-up luuk as he roez to giv her his seet; and when he huryd
away to bring her sum super, she sed to herself, with a satisfied
smiel,—</p>

<p>"Ah, I thaut that wuud do him guud!"</p>

<p>"U luuk liek Balzac's 'Femme peinte par elle-même,'" he sed,
as he fand her with wun hand, and held her cofy-cup in th uther.</p>

<p>"Mi roozh wun't cum off;" and Amy rubd her brilliant cheek,
and shoed him her whiet gluv with a soeber simplisity that maed him
laf outriet.</p>

<p>"Whut do U call this stuf?" he askt, tuching a foeld of her
dres that had bloen oever his nee.</p>

<p>"Iloozhon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">465</span>"Guud naem for it; 
it's verry prity—nue thing, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's as oeld as th hils; U hav seen it on duzens of gurls, and
U never found out that it wuz prity till now—<i>stupide</i>!"</p>

<p>"I never saw it on U befor, which accounts for th mistaek, U
see."</p>

<p>"Nun of that, it is forbiden; I'd rather taek cofy than compliments
just now. No, don't lounge, it maeks me nurvus."</p>

<p>Laurie sat bolt upriets, and meekly tuuk her empty plaet, feeling
an od sort of plezher in having "litl Amy" order him about; for
she had lost her shienes now, and felt an irezistibl dezier to trampl
on him, as gurls hav a delietful wae of dooing when lords of creaeshon
sho any siens of subjekshon.</p>

<p>"Whaer did U lurn all this sort of thing?" he askt, with a qizikal
luuk.</p>

<p>"As 'this sort of thing' is rather a vaeg expreshon, wuud U
kiendly explaen?" returnd Amy, noeing perfectly wel whut he
ment, but wickedly leeving him to descrieb whut is indescriebabl.</p>

<p>"Wel—th jeneral aer, th stiel, th self-possession, 
th—th—iloozhon—U
noe," laft Laurie, braeking doun, and helping
himself out of his qondary with th nue wurd.</p>

<p>Amy wuz gratified, but, of corss, didn't sho it, and demurely
anserd, "Forin lief polishes wun in spiet of wun's self; I study
as wel as plae; and as for this"—with a litl jescher tord her
dres—"whi, tulle is cheep, posies to be had for nuthing, and I am
uezd to maeking th moest of mi puur litl things."</p>

<p>Amy rather regreted that last sentenss, feering it wasn't in guud
taest; but Laurie liked her th beter for it, and found himself boeth
admiering and respekting th braev paeshenss that maed th moest of
oportuenity, and th cheerful spirit that cuverd poverty with flowers.
Amy did not noe whi he luukt at her so kiendly, nor whi he fild up
her book with his oen naem, and devoeted himself to her for th rest
of th evening, in th moest delietful maner; but th impulss that
raut this agreeabl chaenj wuz th rezult of wun of th nue impreshons
which boeth of them wer unconshusly giving and reseeving.</p>

<p class="h2a">ON Th SHELF.</p>

<p><span class="smc">In</span> France th yung gurls hav a dul tiem 
of it till thae ar marryd, when "<i>Vive laa liberté</i>" becums 
thaer moto. In America, as every wun noes, gurls eerly sien th 
declaeraeshon of independenss, and enjoy thaer freedom with republican zest; 
but th yung maetrons uezhualy abdicaet with th furst aer to th throen, 
and go into a secloozhon aulmoest as cloez as a French nunery, tho by no 
means as qieet. Whether thae liek it or not, thae ar vurchualy put upon 
th shelf as soon as th weding exsietment is oever, and moest of them 
miet exclaem, as did a verry prity wuuman th uther dae, "I'm as handsum 
as ever, but no wun taeks any noetis of me because I'm marryd."</p>

<p>Not being a belle or eeven a fashonabl laedy, Meg did not expeeri’enss
this aflikshon till her baebys wer a yeer oeld, for in her litl wurld
primitiv customs prevaeld, and she found herself mor admierd and
beluved than ever.</p>

<p>As she wuz a wuumanly litl wuuman, th maturnal instinkt wuz verry
strong, and she wuz entierly absorbd in her children, to th uter
<span class="pagenum2">467</span>
excloozhon of everything and everybody else. Dae and niet she
brooded oever them with tireless devoeshon and anxiety, leeving John to
th tender mursy of th help, for an Irish laedy now prezieded oever
th kichen department. Being a domestik man, John decidedly
mist th wiefly atenshons he had been accustomed to reseev; but,
as he adord his baebys, he cheerfuly relinqisht his cumfort for a
tiem, supoezing, with mascuelin ignoranss, that peess wuud soon be
restord. But three munths past, and thaer wuz no return of repoez;
Meg luukt worn and nurvus, th baebys absorbd every
mienuet of her tiem, th hous wuz neglekted, and Kity, th cuuk,
hoo tuuk lief "aisy," kept him on short commons. When he went
out in th morning he wuz bewildered by small comishons for th
captiv maama; if he caem gaely in at niet, eeger to embrace his
family, he wuz qencht by a "Hush! thae ar just asleep after wurying
all dae." If he propoezd a litl amuezment at hoem, "No, it
wuud disturb th baebys." If he hinted at a lecture or consert, he
wuz anserd with a reproechful luuk, and a desieded "Leev mi
children for plezher, never!" His sleep wuz broeken by infant waels
and vizhons of a fantom figuer paesing noizlesly to and fro in th
woches of th niet; his meels wer interupted by th freeqent fliet
of th prezieding jeenyus, hoo dezurted him, haf-helpt, if a mufld
churp sounded from th nest abuv; and when he red his paeper of
an evening, Demi's colik got into th shiping-list, and Daezy's faul
affected th priess of stoks, for Mrs. Brooke wuz oenly interested in
domestik nues.</p>

<p>Th puur man wuz verry uncumfortabl, for th children had bereft
him of his wief; hoem wuz meerly a nursery, and th perpechual
"hushing" maed him feel liek a brootal introoder whenever he entered
th saecred precincts of Babyland. He bor it verry paeshently for six
munths, and, when no siens of amendment apeerd, he did whut
uther paturnal exiles do,—tried to get a litl cumfort elsewhere.
Scott had marryd and gon to houskeeping not far off, and John fel
into th wae of runing oever for an our or too of an evening, when
his oen parlor wuz empty, and his oen wief singing lulabies that
seemd to hav no end. Mrs. Scott wuz a lievly, prity gurl, with
nuthing to do but be agreeabl, and she performed her mishon moest
<span class="pagenum2">468</span>
successfully. Th parlor wuz aulwaes briet and atraktiv, th 
ches-bord redy, th piano in tuen, plenty of gae gosip, and a 
niess litl super set forth in tempting stiel.</p>

<p>John wuud hav prefurd his oen fiersied if it had not been so
loenly; but as it wuz, he graetfuly tuuk th next best thing, and enjoyd
his naebor's soesieety.</p>

<p>Meg rather aproovd of th nue araenjment at furst, and found it
a releef to noe that John wuz having a guud tiem insted of doezing
in th parlor, or tramping about th hous and waeking th children.
But by and by, when th teething wury wuz oever, and th iedols went
to sleep at proper ours, leeving maama tiem to rest, she began to
mis John, and fiend her wurk-basket dul company, when he wuz not
sitting opozit in his oeld dresing-goun, comfortably scorching his
slipers on th fender. She wuud not ask him to stae at hoem, but
felt injerd because he did not noe that she wontedw him without
being toeld, entierly forgeting th meny evenings he had waeted for
her in vaen. She wuz nurvus and worn out with woching and wury,
and in that unreezonabl fraem of miend which th best of muthers
ocaezhonaly expeeri’enss when domestik caers opres them. Wont of
exercise robs them of cheerfulnes, and too much devoeshon to that
iedol of American wimen, th teepot, maeks them feel as if thae wer
all nurv and no musl.</p>

<p>"Yes," she wuud sae, luuking in th glas, "I'm geting oeld and
ugly; John doesn't fiend me interesting any longer, so he leevs his
faeded wief and goes to see his prity naebor, hoo has no incumbrances.
Wel, th baebys luv me; thae don't caer if I am thin and
pale, and haeven't tiem to crimp mi haer; thae ar mi cumfort, and
sum dae John wil see whut I've gladly sacrifiest for them, wun't he,
mi precious?"</p>

<p>To which pathetik apeel Daezy wuud anser with a coo, or Demi
with a cro, and Meg wuud put by her lamentaeshons for a maturnal
revel, which soothd her solitued for th tiem being. But th paen
increest as politiks absorbd John, hoo wuz aulwaes runing oever to
discus interesting points with Scott, qiet unconshus that Meg
mist him. Not a wurd did she sae, however, till her muther found
her in teers wun dae, and insisted on noeing whut th maeter wuz, for
Meg's drooping spirits had not escaept her obzervaeshon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">469</span>
"I wouldn't tel any wun exsept U, muther; but I reealy do need
advice, for, if John goes on so much longer I miet as wel be widowed,"
replied Mrs. Brooke, drieing her teers on Daezy's bib, with an
injerd aer.</p>

<p>"Goes on how, mi deer?" askt her muther anxiously.</p>

<p>"He's away all dae, and at niet, when I wont to see him, he is
continually going oever to th Scotts'. It isn't faer that I should hav
th hardest wurk, and never any amuezment. Men ar verry selfish,
eeven th best of them."</p>

<p>"So ar wimen; don't blaem John till U see whaer U ar
rong yuurself."</p>

<p>"But it can't be riet for him to neglekt me."</p>

<p>"Don't U neglekt him?"</p>

<p>"Whi, muther, I thaut U'd taek mi part!"</p>

<p>"So I do, as far as sympathizing goes; but I think th fault is
yuurs, Meg."</p>

<p>"I don't see how."</p>

<p>"Let me sho U. Did John ever neglekt U, as U call it,
whiel U maed it a pointer to giv him yuur soesieety of an evening, his
oenly leezher tiem?"</p>

<p>"No; but I can't do it now, with too baebys to tend."</p>

<p>"I think U cuud, deer; and I think U aut. Mae I speek
qiet freely, and wil U remember that it's muther hoo blaems as
wel as muther hoo sympathizes?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I wil! Speek to me as if I wer litl Meg again. I ofen
feel as if I needed teeching mor than ever sinss thees baebys luuk to
me for everything."</p>

<p>Meg droo her loe chaer besied her muther's, and, with a litl interupshon
in eether lap, th too wimen rokt and taukt luvingly together,
feeling that th tie of mutherhuud maed them mor wun than
ever.</p>

<p>"U hav oenly maed th mistaek that moest yung wievs maek,—forgoten
yuur duty to yuur huzband in yuur luv for yuur children. A
verry nacheral and forgivabl mistaek, Meg, but wun that had beter be
remedied befor U taek to diferent waes; for children should draw
U neerer than ever, not separet U, as if thae wer all yuurs, and
<span class="pagenum2">470</span>
John had nuthing to do but suport them. I've seen it for sum
weeks, but hav not spoeken, feeling shuur it wuud cum riet in tiem."</p>

<p>"I'm afraed it wun't. If I ask him to stae, he'll think I'm jelus;
and I wouldn't insult him by such an iedeea. He doesn't see that I
wont him, and I don't noe how to tel him without wurds."</p>

<p>"Maek it so plezant he wun't wont to go away. Mi deer, he's
longing for his litl hoem; but it isn't hoem without U, and U ar
aulwaes in th nursery."</p>

<p>"Oughtn't I to be thaer?"</p>

<p>"Not all th tiem; too much confienment maeks U nurvus, and
then U ar unfited for everything. Besieds, U oe sumthing to
John as wel as to th baebys; don't neglekt huzband for children,
don't shut him out of th nursery, but teech him how to help in it.
His plaess is thaer as wel as yuurs, and th children need him; let
him feel that he has his part to do, and he wil do it gladly and faethfuly,
and it wil be beter for U all."</p>

<p>"U reealy think so, muther?"</p>

<p>"I noe it, Meg, for I've tried it; and I seldom giv advice unles
I've proovd its practicability. When U and Jo wer litl, I went
on just as U ar, feeling as if I didn't do mi duty unles I devoeted
mieself hoely to U. Puur faather tuuk to his books, after I had refuezd
all ofers of help, and left me to tri mi experriment aloen. I
strugld along as wel as I cuud, but Jo wuz too much for me. I
neerly spoilt her by induljenss. U wer poorly, and I wuryd
about U till I fel sik mieself. Then faather caem to th rescue, qieetly
manejd everything, and maed himself so helpful that I saw mi
mistaek, and never hav been aebl to get on without him sinss. That
is th seecret of our hoem hapynes: he duz not let business ween
him from th litl caers and duties that affect us all, and I tri not to
let domestik wurys destroy mi interest in his pursuits. Eech do our
part aloen in meny things, but at hoem we wurk together, aulwaes."</p>

<p>"It is so, muther; and mi graet wish is to be to mi huzband and
children whut U hav been to yuurs. Sho me how; I'll do anything
U sae."</p>

<p>"U aulwaes wer mi docile dauter. Wel, deer, if I wer U,
I'd let John hav mor to do with th manejment of Demi, for th
<span class="pagenum2">471</span>
boy needs traening, and it's nun too soon to begin. Then I'd do whut
I hav ofen propoezd, let Hannah cum and help U; she is a capital
nurss, and U mae trust th precious baebys to her whiel U do mor
houswurk. U need th exercise, Hannah wuud enjoy th rest, and
John wuud fiend his wief again. Go out mor; keep cheerful as wel
as busy, for U ar th sunshine-maeker of th family, and if U get
dizmal thaer is no faer wether. Then I'd tri to taek an interest in
whotever John lieks,—tauk with him, let him red to U, exchange
iedeeas, and help eech uther in that wae. Don't shut yuurself up in a
bandbox because U ar a wuuman, but understand whut is going on,
and ejucaet yuurself to taek yuur part in th wurld's wurk, for it
all affects U and yuurs."</p>

<p>"John is so sensibl, I'm afraed he wil think I'm stoopid if I ask
qeschons about politiks and things."</p>

<p>"I don't beleev he wuud; luv cuvers a multitued of sins, and of
hoom cuud U ask mor freely than of him? Tri it, and see if
he doesn't fiend yuur soesieety far mor agreeabl than Mrs. Scott's
supers."</p>

<p>"I wil. Puur John! I'm afraed I <em>hav</em> neglekted him sadly, but I
thaut I wuz riet, and he never sed anything."</p>

<p>"He tried not to be selfish, but he <em>has</em> felt rather forlorn, I fansy.
This is just th tiem, Meg, when yung marryd peepl ar apt to
gro apart, and th verry tiem when thae aut to be moest together;
for th furst tenderness soon waers off, unles caer is taeken to prezurv
it; and no tiem is so buetiful and precious to paerents as th furst
yeers of th litl lievs given them to traen. Don't let John be a
straenjer to th baebys, for thae wil do mor to keep him saef and
hapy in this wurld of trieal and temptaeshon than anything else, and
thru them U wil lurn to noe and luv wun anuther as U
should. Now, deer, guud-by; think oever muther's preechment, akt
upon it if it seems guud, and God bles U all!"</p>

<p>Meg did think it oever, found it guud, and akted upon it, tho th
furst atempt wuz not maed exaktly as she pland to hav it. Of
corss th children tyrannized oever her, and roold th hous as so on
as thae found out that kiking and squalling brought them whotever
thae wontedw. Maama wuz an abjekt slaev to thaer caprices, but papa
<span class="pagenum2">472</span>
wuz not so eezily subjugaeted, and ocaezhonaly aflikted his tender spouse
by an atempt at paturnal disiplin with his obstreperous sun. For
Demi inherrited a trifle of his sier's furmnes of carrakter,—we wun't call
it obstinasy,—and when he maed up his litl miend to hav or to do
anything, all th king's horses and all th king's men cuud not chaenj
that pertinacious litl miend. Maama thaut th deer too yung to
be taut to conker his prejudises, but papa beleevd that it never
wuz too soon to lurn oebeedi’enss; so Master Demi eerly discuverd
that when he undertuuk to "wrastle" with "parpar," he aulwaes got th
wurst of it; yet, liek th Englishman, Baeby respekted th man hoo
conkerd him, and luvd th faather hoos graev "No, no," wuz
mor impresiv than all maama's luv-pats.</p>

<p>A fue daes after th tauk with her muther, Meg rezolvd to tri a
soeshal evening with John; so she orderd a niess super, set th parlor
in order, drest herself pritily, and put th children to bed eerly,
that nuthing should interfeer with her experriment. But, unforchunatly,
Demi's moest unconkerabl prejudis wuz against going to bed,
and that niet he desieded to go on a rampage; so puur Meg sung and
rokt, toeld storys and tried every sleep-provoeking wiel she cuud
deviez, but all in vaen, th big ies wouldn't shut; and long after
Daezy had gon to byelow, liek th chuby litl bunch of guud-naechuur
she wuz, nauty Demi lae staering at th liet, with th moest discurejingly
wied-awake expreshon of countenanss.</p>

<p>"Wil Demi lie still liek a guud boy, whiel maama runs doun and
givs puur papa his tee?" askt Meg, as th haul-dor softly cloezd,
and th wel-noen step went tiptoeing into th diening-room.</p>

<p>"Me has tee!" sed Demi, prepaering to join in th revel.</p>

<p>"No; but I'll saev U sum litl cakies for brekfast, if U'll go
bye-by liek Daezy. Wil U, lovey?"</p>

<p>"Iss!" and Demi shut his ies tight, as if to cach sleep and hurry
th dezierd dae.</p>

<p>Taeking advantej of th propitious moement, Meg slipt away, and
ran doun to greet her huzband with a smieling faess, and th litl bloo
boe in her haer which wuz his especial admeraeshon. He saw it at wunss,
and sed, with pleezd serpriez,—</p>

<p>"Whi, litl muther, how gae we ar to-niet. Do U expect
company?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">473</span>
"Oenly U, deer."</p>

<p>"Is it a burthdae, anniversary, or anything?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm tierd of being a dowdy, so I drest up as a chaenj.
U aulwaes maek yuurself niess for taebl, no mater how tierd U ar;
so whi shouldn't I when I hav th tiem?"</p>

<p>"I do it out of respekt to U, mi deer," sed oeld-fashond John.</p>

<p>"Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke," laft Meg, luuking yung and prity
again, as she noded to him oever th teepot.</p>

<p>"Wel, it's aultogether delietful, and liek oeld times. This taests
riet. I drink yuur helth, deer." And John sipt his tee with an aer
of reposeful rapcher, which wuz of verry
short duration, however; for, as he put
doun his cup, th dor-handl ratld misteeriusly,
and a litl vois wuz hurd, saeing
impaeshently,—</p>

<p>"Opy doy; me's tummin!"</p>

<p>"It's that nauty boy. I toeld him to
go to sleep aloen, and heer he is, dounstaers,
geting his deth a-coeld patering
oever that canvas," sed Meg, ansering th
call.</p>

<p>"Mornin' now," anounst Demi, in a
joyful toen, as he entered, with his long
niet-goun graesfuly festooned oever his
arm, and every curl bobing gaely as
he pranst about th taebl, ieing th
"cakies" with luving glanses.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't morning yet. U must
go to bed, and not trubl puur maama;
then U can hav th litl caek with sugar on it."</p>

<p>"Me luvs parpar," sed th artful wun, prepaering to cliem th paturnal
nee, and revel in forbiden joys. But John shuuk his hed,
and sed to Meg,—</p>

<p>"If U toeld him to stae up thaer, and go to sleep aloen, maek him
do it, or he wil never lurn to miend U."</p>

<p>"Yes, of corss. Cum, Demi;" and Meg led her sun away, feeling
<span class="pagenum2">474</span>
a strong dezier to spank th litl marplot hoo hopt besied her,
laeboring under th deloozhon that th bribe wuz to be administerd as
soon as thae reached th nursery.</p>

<p>Nor wuz he disapointed; for that short-sieted wuuman akchualy
gaev him a lump of sugar, tukt him into his bed, and forbaed any
mor promenades till morning.</p>

<p>"Iss!" sed Demi th perjured, blissfully suking his sugar, and
regarding his furst atempt as eminently successful.</p>

<p>Meg returnd to her plaess, and super wuz progresing pleasantly,
when th litl goest waukt again, and expoezd th maturnal delinqensys
by boeldly demanding,—</p>

<p>"Mor sudar, marmar."</p>

<p>"Now this wun't do," sed John, hardening his hart against th
engaejing litl siner. "We shal never noe any peess till that
chield lurns to go to bed properly. U hav maed a slaev of yuurself
long enough; giv him wun leson, and then thaer wil be an end
of it. Put him in his bed and leev him, Meg."</p>

<p>"He wun't stae thaer; he never duz, unles I sit by him."</p>

<p>"I'll manej him. Demi, go upstaers, and get into yuur bed, as
maama bids U."</p>

<p>"S'ant!" replied th yung rebl, helping himself to th cuveted
"cakie," and begining to eat th saem with calm audasity.</p>

<p>"U must never sae that to papa; I shal carry U if U don't
go yuurself."</p>

<p>"Go 'wae; me don't luv parpar;" and Demi retierd to his
muther's scurts for protection.</p>

<p>But eeven that refuej proovd unavaeling, for he wuz deliverd oever
to th enemy, with a "Be jentl with him, John," which struk th
culprit with dismae; for when maama dezurted him, then th jujment-dae
wuz at hand. Bereft of his caek, defrauded of his frolik,
and borne away by a strong hand to that detested bed, puur Demi
cuud not restraen his rath, but oepenly defied papa, and kikt and
screemd lustily all th wae upstaers. Th mienuet he wuz put into
bed on wun sied, he roeld out on th uther, and maed for th dor,
oenly to be ignominusly caut up by th tael of his litl toega, and
put bak again, which lievly performance wuz kept up till th yung
<span class="pagenum2">475</span>
man's strength gaev out, when he devoeted himself to roring at th
top of his vois. This voekal exercise uezhualy conkerd Meg; but
John sat as unmoovd as th poest which is popuelarly beleevd to be
def. No coexing, no sugar, no lulabi, no story; eeven th liet wuz
put out, and oenly th red glo of th fier enlivened th "big dark"
which Demi regarded with cueriosity rather than feer. This nue order
of things disgusted him, and he hould dizmaly for "marmar," as his
anggry pashons subsided, and recolekshons of his tender bondwoman
returnd to th captiv autocrat. Th plaentiv wael which succeeded
th pashonat ror went to Meg's hart, and she ran up to sae
beseechingly,—</p>

<p>"Let me stae with him; he'll be guud, now, John."</p>

<p>"No, mi deer, I've toeld him he must go to sleep, as U bid him;
and he must, if I stae heer all niet."</p>

<p>"But he'll cri himself sik," pleeded Meg, reproeching herself for
dezurting her boy.</p>

<p>"No, he wun't, he's so tierd he wil soon drop off, and then th
mater is setld; for he wil understand that he has got to miend.
Don't interfeer; I'll manej him."</p>

<p>"He's mi chield, and I can't hav his spirit broeken by harshnes."</p>

<p>"He's mi chield, and I wun't hav his temper spoilt by induljenss.
Go doun, mi deer, and leev th boy to me."</p>

<p>When John spoek in that masterful toen, Meg aulwaes oebaed, and
never regreted her docility.</p>

<p>"Pleez let me kis him wunss, John?"</p>

<p>"Surtenly. Demi, sae 'guud-niet' to maama, and let her go
and rest, for she is verry tierd with taeking caer of U all dae."</p>

<p>Meg aulwaes insisted upon it that th kis wun th viktory; for after
it wuz given, Demi sobd mor qieetly, and lae qiet still at th bottom
of th bed, whither he had rigld in his anguish of miend.</p>

<p>"Puur litl man, he's worn out with sleep and crieing. I'll cuver
him up, and then go and set Meg's hart at rest," thaut John,
creeping to th bedside, hoeping to fiend his rebelyus aer asleep.</p>

<p>But he wasn't; for th moement his faather peept at
him, Demi's
ies oepend, his litl chin began to qiver, and he put up his arms,
saeing, with a penitent hicup, "Me's dood, now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">476</span>
Sitting on th staers, outsied, Meg wunderd at th long silence
which foloed th upror; and, after imajining all sorts of imposibl
accidents, she slipt into th room, to set her feers at rest. Demi
lae fast asleep; not in his uezhual spred-eegl atitued, but in a subdued
bunch, cudld cloez in th surkl of his faather's arm and
hoelding his faather's fingger, as if he felt that justis wuz temperd with
mursy, and had gon to sleep a sader and a wiezer baeby. So held,
John had waeted with wuumanly paeshenss till th litl hand relaxt its
hoeld; and, whiel waeting, had faulen asleep, mor tierd by that tussle
with his sun than with his hoel dae's wurk.</p>

<p>As Meg stuud woching th too faeses on th pilo, she smield to
herself, and then slipt away again, saeing, in a satisfied toen,—</p>

<p>"I never need feer that John wil be too harsh with mi baebys: he
<em>duz</em> noe how to manej them, and wil be a graet help, for Demi 
<em>is</em> geting too much for me."</p>

<p>When John caem doun at last, expecting to fiend a pensiv or reproechful
wief, he wuz agreeably serpriezd to fiend Meg plasidly trimming
a bonnet, and to be greeted with th reqest to red sumthing
about th elekshon, if he wuz not too tierd. John saw in a mienuet that
a revolooshon of sum kiend wuz going on, but wiezly askt no qeschons,
noeing that Meg wuz such a transpaerent litl purson, she
couldn't keep a seecret to saev her lief, and thaerfor th cloo wuud
soon apeer. He red a long debaet with th moest aemiabl redynes,
and then explaend it in his moest loosid maner, whiel Meg tried to
luuk deeply interested, to ask intelijent qeschons, and keep her
thoughts from waandering from th staet of th naeshon to th staet of
her bonnet. In her seecret soel, however, she desieded that politiks wer
as bad as mathematiks, and that th mishon of politishans seemd to
be calling eech uther naems; but she kept thees feminine iedeeas to
herself, and when John paused, shuuk her hed, and sed with whut
she thaut diplomatik ambigueity,—</p>

<p>"Wel, I reealy don't see whut we ar cuming to."</p>

<p>John laft, and wocht her for a mienuet, as she poizd a prity
litl preparaeshon of laess and flowers on her hand, and regarded it with
th jenuein interest which his harang had faeld to waken.</p>

<p>"She is trieing to liek politiks for mi saek, so I'll tri and liek
<span class="pagenum2">477</span>
milinery for hers, that's oenly faer," thaut John th Just, ading
aloud,—</p>

<p>"That's verry prity; is it whut U call a brekfast-cap?"</p>

</div>

<p>"Mi deer man, it's a bonnet! Mi verry best go-to-consert-and-theeater
bonnet."</p>

<p>"I beg yuur pardon; it wuz so small, I nacheraly mistuuk it for wun
of th fli-away things U sumtiems waer. How do U keep it on?"</p>

<p>"Thees bits of laess ar fasend under th chin with a roezbud,
so;" and Meg ilustraeted by putting on th bonnet, and regarding
him with an aer of calm satisfakshon that wuz irezistibl.</p>

<p>"It's a luv of a bonnet, but I prefur th faess insied, for it luuks
yung and hapy again," and John kist th smieling faess, to th
graet detriment of th roezbud under th chin.</p>

<p>"I'm glad U liek it, for I wont U to taek me to wun of th nue
conserts sum niet; I reealy need sum muezik to put me in tuen.
Wil U, pleez?"</p>

<p>"Of corss I wil, with all mi hart, or anywhere else U liek.
<span class="pagenum2">478</span>
U hav been shut up so long, it wil do U no end of guud, and
I shal enjoy it, of all things. Whut put it into yuur hed, litl
muther?"</p>

<p>"Wel, I had a tauk with Marmee th uther dae, and toeld her how
nurvus and cros and out of sorts I felt, and she sed I needed
chaenj and les caer; so Hannah is to help me with th children,
and I'm to see to things about th hous mor, and now and then
hav a litl fun, just to keep me from geting to be a fijety, broeken-doun
oeld wuuman befor mi tiem. It's oenly an experriment, John,
and I wont to tri it for yuur saek as much as for mien, because I've
neglekted U shaemfuly laetly, and I'm going to maek hoem whut it
uezd to be, if I can. U don't objekt, I hoep?"</p>

<p>Never miend whut John sed, or whut a verry narro escaep th litl
bonnet had from uter rooin; all that we hav any business to noe, is
that John did <em>not</em> apeer to objekt, jujing from th chaenjes which
grajualy tuuk plaess in th hous and its inmaets. It wuz not all
Paradise by any means, but every wun wuz beter for th division of
laebor system; th children throve under th paturnal rool, for accurate,
steadfast John brought order and oebeedi’enss into Babydom, whiel
Meg recuverd her spirits and compoezd her nerves by plenty of
hoelsum exercise, a litl plezher, and much confidenshal conversation
with her sensibl huzband. Hoem groo hoem-liek again, and
John had no wish to leev it, unles he tuuk Meg with him. Th
Scotts caem to th Brookes' now, and every wun found th litl hous
a cheerful plaess, fuul of hapynes, content, and family luv. Eeven gae
Sallie Moffatt liked to go thaer. "It is aulwaes so qieet and plezant
heer; it duz me guud, Meg," she uezd to sae, luuking about her
with wistful ies, as if trieing to discuver th charm, that she miet uez
it in her graet hous, fuul of splendid loenlynes; for thaer wer no
rieotus, suny-faest baebys thaer, and Ned livd in a wurld of his oen,
whaer thaer wuz no plaess for her.</p>

<p>This hous-hoeld hapynes did not cum all at wunss, but John and
Meg had found th kee to it, and eech yeer of marryd lief taut
them how to uez it, unloking th treasuries of reeal hoem-luv and
muechual helpfulness, which th poorest mae possess, and th richest
cannot bie. This is th sort of shelf on which yung wievs and
<span class="pagenum2">479</span>
muthers mae consent to be laed, saef from th restles fret and feever
of th wurld, fiending loyal luvers in th litl suns and dauters hoo

by sied, thru faer and stormy wether, with a faethful frend, hoo is,
in th troo senss of th guud oeld Saxon wurd, th "hous-band," and
lurning, as Meg lurnd, that a wuuman's hapyest kingdom is hoem,
her hieest onor th art of rooling it, not as a qeen, but a wiez wief

<p><span class="smc">Laurie</span> went to Niess intending to stae a
week, and remaend a munth. He wuz tierd
of waandering about aloen, and Amy's familyar
presence seemd to giv a hoem-liek charm to th
forin seens in which she bor a part. He rather
mist th "peting" he uezd to reseev, and enjoyd
a taest of it again; for no atenshons, however flatering,
from straenjers, wer haf so plezant as th sisterly adoration
of th gurls at hoem. Amy never wuud pet him
liek th others, but she wuz verry glad to see him now,
and qiet clung to him, feeling that he wuz th reprezentativ
of th deer family for hoom she longed
mor than she wuud confes. Thae nacheraly tuuk cumfort in eech
uther's soesieety, and wer much together, rieding, wauking, dansing, or
daudling, for, at Niess, no wun can be verry industrius duuring th gae
seezon. But, whiel apparently amuezing themselvs in th moest careless
fashon, thae wer haf-consciously maeking discuverys and forming
opinyons about eech uther. Amy roez daily in th estimation of
her frend, but he sunk in hers, and eech felt th trooth befor a wurd
<span class="pagenum2">481</span>
wuz spoeken. Amy tried to pleez, and succeeded, for she wuz graetful
for th meny plezhers he gaev her, and re-paed him with th litl
survises to which wuumanly wimen noe how to lend an indescriebabl
charm. Laurie maed no efort of any kiend, but just let himself drift
along as comfortably as posibl, trieing to forget, and feeling that all
wimen oed him a kiend wurd because wun had been coeld to him. It
cost him no efort to be jenerus, and he wuud hav given Amy all
th trinkets in Niess if she wuud hav taeken them; but, at th saem
tiem, he felt that he cuud not chaenj th opinyon she wuz forming of
him, and he rather dreded th keen bloo ies that seemd to woch
him with such haf-sorroeful, haf-scornful serpriez.</p>

<p>"All th rest hav gon to Monaco for th dae; I prefurd to stae
at hoem and riet leters. Thae ar dun now, and I am going to
Valrosa to skech; wil U cum?" sed Amy, as she joind Laurie
wun luvly dae when he lounged in as uezhual, about noon.</p>

<p>"Wel, yes; but isn't it rather worm for such a long wauk?" he
anserd sloely, for th shaeded <i>salon</i> luukt invieting, after th glaer
without.</p>

<p>"I'm going to hav th litl carrej, and Baptiste can driev, so
U'll hav nuthing to do but hoeld yuur umbrela and keep yuur
gluvs niess," returnd Amy, with a sarcastik glanss at th imacuelet
kid, which wer a week pointer with Laurie.</p>

<p>"Then I'll go with plezher;" and he put out his hand for her
skech-book. But she tukt it under her arm with a sharp—</p>

<p>"Don't trubl yuurself; it's no exertion to me, but <em>U</em> don't luuk
equal to it."</p>

<p>Laurie lifted his iebrows, and foloed at a leezherly paess as she
ran dounstaers; but when thae got into th carrej he tuuk th raens
himself, and left litl Baptiste nuthing to do but foeld his arms and faul
asleep on his purch.</p>

<p>Th too never quarrelled,—Amy wuz too wel-bred, and just now
Laurie wuz too laezy; so, in a mienuet he peept under her hat-brim
with an inqiering aer; she anserd with a smiel, and thae went on
together in th moest amicabl maner.</p>

<p>It wuz a luvly driev, along wiending roeds rich in th picturesque
seens that deliet buety-luving ies. Heer an ancient monasterry,
<span class="pagenum2">482</span>
whenss th solem chanting of th munks caem doun to them. Thaer
a baer-leged sheperd, in wuuden shoos, pointed hat, and ruf
jaket oever wun shoulder, sat pieping on a stoen, whiel his goets skipt
amung th roks or lae at his feet. Meek, mous-culord donkys,
laeden with panniers of freshly-cut gras, past by, with a prity gurl
in a <i>capaline</i> sitting between th green piels, or an oeld wuuman spining
with a distaf as she went. Broun, soft-ied children ran out
from th qaent stoen huvels to ofer noezgaes, or bunches of orenjes
still on th bow. Narld oliv-trees cuverd th hils with thaer
dusky foelej, froot hung goelden in th orchard, and graet scarlet
anemones frinjd th roedsied; whiel beyond green sloeps and cragy
hiets, th Marritiem Alps roez sharp and whiet against th bloo Italian
ski.</p>

<p>Valrosa wel dezurvd its naem, for, in that cliemat of perpechual
sumer, roezes blossomed everywhaer. Thae overhung th archway,
thrust themselvs between th bars of th graet gaet with a sweet welcum
to passers-by, and liend th avenu, wiending thru lemon-trees
and fethery paams up to th vila on th hil. Every shadoey
nuuk, whaer seets invieted wun to stop and rest, wuz a mas of bloom;
every cool groto had its marbl nimf smieling from a vael of flowers,
and every founten reflekted crimson, whiet, or pale pink roezes, leening
doun to smiel at thaer oen buety. Roezes cuverd th wauls of
th hous, draept th cornises, cliemd th pillars, and ran rieot oever
th balustrade of th wied terris, whenss wun luukt doun on th
suny Mediterranean, and th whiet-wauld sity on its shor.</p>

<p>"This is a reguelar hunymoon Paradise, isn't it? Did U ever see
such roezes?" askt Amy, pausing on th terris to enjoy th vue,
and a lugzhuurius whiff of perfume that caem waandering by.</p>

<p>"No, nor felt such thorns," returnd Laurie, with his thum in his
mouth, after a vaen atempt to capcher a solitaery scarlet flower that
groo just beyond his reech.</p>

<p>"Tri loeer doun, and pik thoes that hav no thorns," sed Amy,
gathering three of th tieny creem-culord wuns that stard th waul
behind her. She put them in his buton-hoel, as a peess-ofering,
and he stuud a mienuet luuking doun at them with a cuerius expreshon,
for in th Italian part of his naechuur thaer wuz a tuch of superstition,
<span class="pagenum2">483</span>
and he wuz just then in that staet of haf-sweet, haf-biter
melancholy, when imajinativ yung men fiend significanss in trifles,
and food for roemanss everywhaer. He had thaut of Jo in reeching
after th thorny red roez, for vivid flowers becaem her, and
she had ofen worn wuns liek that from th greenhous at hoem.
Th pale roezes Amy gaev him wer th sort that th Italians lae in
ded hands, never in briedal reeths, and, for a moement, he wunderd
if th oemen wuz for Jo or for himself; but th next instant his American
common-senss got th beter of sentimentality, and he laft a
hartyer laf than Amy had hurd sinss he caem.</p>

<p>"It's guud advice; U'd beter taek it and saev yuur finggers,"
she sed, thinking her speech amuezd him.</p>

<p>"Thank U, I wil," he anserd in jest, and a fue munths laeter
he did it in urnest.</p>

<p>"Laurie, when ar U going to yuur grandfaather?" she askt
prezently, as she setld herself on a rustik seet.</p>

<p>"Verry soon."</p>

<p>"U hav sed that a duzen times within th last three weeks."</p>

<p>"I daer sae; short ansers saev trubl."</p>

<p>"He expects U, and U reealy aut to go."</p>

<p>"Hospitabl creecher! I noe it."</p>

<p>"Then whi don't U do it?"</p>

<p>"Nacheral depravity, I supoez."</p>

<p>"Nacheral indolenss, U meen. It's reealy dredful!" and Amy
luukt seveer.</p>

<p>"Not so bad as it seems, for I should oenly plaeg him if I went,
so I miet as wel stae, and plaeg U a litl longer, U can baer it
beter; in fakt, I think it agrees with U exselently;" and Laurie
compoezd himself for a lounge on th braud ledge of th balustrade.</p>

<p>Amy shuuk her hed, and oepend her skech-book with an aer of
rezignaeshon; but she had maed up her miend to lecture "that boy,"
and in a mienuet she began again.</p>

<p>"Whut ar U dooing just now?"</p>

<p>"Woching lizards."</p>

<p>"No, no; I meen whut do U intend and wish to do?"</p>

<p>"Smoek a sigaret, if U'll alow me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">484</span>
"How provoeking U ar! I don't aproov of sigars, and I wil
oenly alow it on condishon that U let me put U into mi skech; I
need a figuer."</p>

<p>
"With all th plezher in lief. How wil U hav me,—fuul-length
or three-qorters, on mi hed or mi heels? I should respektfuly
sugjest a recumbent posture, then put yuurself in aulso, and call it
'<i>Dolce far niente.</i>'"</p>

<p>
"Stae as U ar, and go to sleep if U liek. <em>I</em> intend to wurk
hard," sed Amy, in her moest enerjetik toen.</p>

<p>
"Whut delietful enthusiasm!" and he leend against a taul urn
with an aer of entier satisfakshon.</p>

<p>
"Whut wuud Jo sae if she saw U now?" askt Amy impaeshently,
hoeping to stur him up by th menshon of her still mor enerjetik
sister's naem.</p>

<p>
"As uezhual, 'Go away, Teddy, I'm busy!'" He laft as he
spoek, but th laf wuz not nacheral, and a shaed past oever his
faess, for th uteranss of th familyar naem tucht th woond that
wuz not heeld yet. Boeth toen and shado struk Amy, for she had
seen and hurd them befor, and now she luukt up in tiem to cach
a nue expreshon on Laurie's faess,—a hard, biter luuk, fuul of paen,
dissatisfaction, and regret. It wuz gon befor she cuud study it, and
th listles expreshon bak again. She wocht him for a moement
with artistik plezher, thinking how liek an Italian he luukt, as he
lae basking in th sun with uncovered hed, and ies fuul of suthern
dreaminess; for he seemd to hav forgoten her, and faulen into a
reverie.</p>

<p>
"U luuk liek th effigy of a yung niet asleep on his toom,"
she sed, carefully traesing th wel-cut profile defiend against th dark
stoen.</p>

<p>
"Wish I wuz!"</p>

<p>
"That's a foolish wish, unles U hav spoilt yuur lief. U ar
so chaenjd, I sumtiems think—" thaer Amy stopt, with a haf-timid,
haf-wistful luuk, mor significant than her unfinisht speech.</p>

<p>Laurie saw and understuud th affectionate anxiety which she hezitaeted
to expres, and luuking straet into her ies, sed, just as he
uezd to sae it to her muther,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">485</span>
"It's all riet, maa'am."</p>

<p>That satisfied her and set at rest th doubts that had begun to
wury her laetly. It aulso tucht her, and she shoed that it did, by
th corjal toen in which she sed,—</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that! I didn't think U'd been a verry bad boy,
but I fansyd U miet hav waested muny at that wiked Baden-Baden,
lost yuur hart to sum charming Frenchwoman with a huzband,
or got into sum of th scraeps that yung men seem to consider
a nesesaery part of a forin tour. Don't stae out thaer in th
sun; cum and lie on th gras heer, and 'let us be frendly,' as Jo
uezd to sae when we got in th soefa-corner and toeld seecrets."</p>

</div>

<p>Laurie oebeedi’ently throo himself doun on th turf, and began to
amuez himself by stiking daezys into th ribons of Amy's hat, that
lae thaer.</p>

<p>"I'm all redy for th seecrets;" and he glanst up with a desieded
expreshon of interest in his ies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">486</span>
"I've nun to tel; U mae begin."</p>

<p>"Haeven't wun to bles mieself with. I thaut perhaps U'd
had sum nues from hoem."</p>

<p>"U hav hurd all that has cum laetly. Don't U heer ofen?
I fansyd Jo wuud send U voluems."</p>

<p>"She's verry busy; I'm roeving about so, it's imposibl to be
reguelar, U noe. When do U begin yuur graet wurk of art,
Raphaella?" he askt, chaenjing th subjekt abruptly after anuther
pause, in which he had been wundering if Amy knew his seecret, and
wontedw to tauk about it.</p>

<p>"Never," she anserd, with a despondent but desieded aer.
"Rome tuuk all th vanity out of me; for after seeing th wunders
thaer, I felt too insignificant to liv, and gaev up all mi foolish hoeps
in despaer."</p>

<p>"Whi should U, with so much enerjy and talent?"</p>

<p>"That's just whi,—because talent isn't jeenyus, and no amount of
enerjy can maek it so. I wont to be graet, or nuthing. I wun't be
a common-plaess dauber, so I don't intend to tri any mor."</p>

<p>"And whut ar U going to do with yuurself now, if I mae ask?"</p>

<p>"Polish up mi uther talents, and be an ornament to soesieety, if I
get th chanss."</p>

<p>It wuz a carrakteristik speech, and sounded daring; but audasity
becums yung peepl, and Amy's ambishon had a guud foundaeshon.
Laurie smield, but he liked th spirit with which she tuuk up
a nue purpos when a long-cherrisht wun died, and spent no tiem
lamenting.</p>

<p>"Guud! and heer is whaer Fred Vaughn cums in, I fansy."</p>

<p>Amy prezurvd a discrete silence, but thaer wuz a conshus luuk in
her douncast faess, that maed Laurie sit up and sae gravely,—</p>

<p>"Now I'm going to plae bruther, and ask qeschons. Mae I?"</p>

<p>"I don't promis to anser."</p>

<p>"Yuur faess wil, if yuur tung wun't. U aren't wuuman of th
wurld enough yet to hied yuur feelings, mi deer. I hurd roomors
about Fred and U last yeer, and it's mi private opinyon that, if he
had not been called hoem so sudenly and detaend so long, sumthing
wuud hav cum of it—hae?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">487</span>
"That's not for me to sae," wuz Amy's prim replie; but her lips
wuud smiel, and thaer wuz a traitorous sparkl of th ie, which
betraed that she knew her power and enjoyd th nolej.</p>

<p>"U ar not engaejd, I hoep?" and Laurie luukt verry elder-brutherly
and graev all of a suden.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But U wil be, if he cums bak and goes properly doun upon
his nees, wun't U?"</p>

<p>"Verry liekly."</p>

<p>"Then U ar fond of oeld Fred?"</p>

<p>"I cuud be, if I tried."</p>

<p>"But U don't intend to tri till th proper moement? Bles mi
soel, whut unurthly prudence! He's a guud felo, Amy, but not
th man I fansyd U'd liek."</p>

<p>"He is rich, a jentlman, and has delietful maners," began Amy,
trieing to be qiet cool and dignified, but feeling a litl ashamed of
herself, in spiet of th sincerity of her intenshons.</p>

<p>"I understand; qeens of soesieety can't get on without muny, so
U meen to maek a guud mach, and start in that wae? Qiet riet
and proper, as th wurld goes, but it sounds od from th lips of wun
of yuur muther's gurls."</p>

<p>"Troo, nevertheles."</p>

<p>A short speech, but th qieet desizhon with which it wuz uterd
contrasted cueriusly with th yung speeker. Laurie felt this instinktivly,
and laed himself doun again, with a senss of disapointment
which he cuud not explaen. His luuk and silence, as wel as a surten
inward self-disaprooval, rufld Amy, and maed her rezolv to deliver
her lecture without delae.</p>

<p>"I wish U'd do me th faevor to rouz yuurself a litl," she sed
sharply.</p>

<p>"Do it for me, thaer's a deer gurl."</p>

<p>"I cuud, if I tried;" and she luukt as if she wuud liek dooing it
in th moest summary stiel.</p>

<p>"Tri, then; I giv U leev," returnd Laurie, hoo enjoyd having
sum wun to teez, after his long abstinenss from his faevorit pastime.</p>

<p>"U'd be anggry in fiev minits."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">488</span>
"I'm never anggry with U. It taeks too flints to maek a fier: U
ar as cool and soft as sno."</p>

<p>"U don't noe whut I can do; sno produces a glo and a
tingle, if aplied rietly. Yuur indiferens is haf affectation, and a
guud sturing up wuud proov it."</p>

<p>"Stur away; it wun't hurt me and it mae amuez U, as th big man
sed when his litl wief beet him. Regard me in th liet of a huzband
or a carpet, and beet till U ar tierd, if that sort of exercise agrees
with U."</p>

<p>Being decidedly netld herself, and longing to see him shaek off th
apathy that so aulterd him, Amy sharpend boeth tung and pensil,
and began:—</p>

<p>"Flo and I hav got a nue naem for U; it's 'Laezy Laurence.'
How do U liek it?"</p>

<p>She thaut it wuud anoy him; but he oenly foelded his arms under
his hed, with an imperturbabl "That's not bad. Thank U, laedys."</p>

<p>"Do U wont to noe whut I onestly think of U?"</p>

<p>"Piening to be toeld."</p>

<p>"Wel, I despiez U."</p>

<p>If she had eeven sed "I haet U," in a petulant or coquettish toen,
he wuud hav laft, and rather liked it; but th graev, aulmoest sad,
accent of her vois maed him oepen his ies, and ask qikly,—</p>

<p>"Whi, if U pleez?"</p>

<p>"Because, with every chanss for being guud, uesful, and hapy, U
ar faulty, laezy, and mizerabl."</p>

<p>"Strong langgwej, mademezel."</p>

<p>"If U liek it, I'll go on."</p>

<p>"Prae, do; it's qiet interesting."</p>

<p>"I thaut U'd fiend it so; selfish peepl aulwaes liek to tauk about
themselvs."</p>

<p>"Am <em>I</em> selfish?" Th qeschon slipt out involuntarrily and in a
toen of serpriez, for th wun vurchoo on which he prided himself wuz
jenerosity.</p>

<p>"Yes, verry selfish," continued Amy, in a calm, cool vois, twice as
efektiv, just then, as an anggry wun. "I'll sho U how, for I've
studyd U whiel we hav been froliking, and I'm not at all satisfied
<span class="pagenum2">489</span>
with U. Heer U hav been abraud neerly six munths, and dun
nuthing but waest tiem and muny and disapoint yuur frends."</p>

<p>"Isn't a felo to hav any plezher after a foer-yeers griend?"</p>

<p>"U don't luuk as if U'd had much; at any raet, U ar nun
th beter for it, as far as I can see. I sed, when we furst met, that
U had improovd. Now I taek it all bak, for I don't think U haf
so niess as when I left U at hoem. U hav groen abominably
laezy; U liek gosip, and waest tiem on frivolus things; U ar
contented to be peted and admierd by sily peepl, insted of being
luvd and respekted by wiez wuns. With muny, talent, pozishon,
helth, and buety,—ah, U liek that, Oeld Vanity! but it's th trooth,
so I can't help saeing it,—with all thees splendid things to uez and
enjoy, U can fiend nuthing to do but daudl; and, insted of being
th man U miet and aut to be, U ar oenly—" Thaer she
stopt, with a luuk that had boeth paen and pity in it.</p>

<p>"Saent Laurence on a gridieron," aded Laurie, blandly finishing th
sentenss. But th lecture began to taek efekt, for thaer wuz a wied-awake
sparkl in his ies now, and a haf-anggry, haf-injerd expreshon
replaest th former indiferens.</p>

<p>"I supoezd U'd taek it so. U men tel us we ar aenjels, and
sae we can maek U whut we wil; but th instant we onestly tri to
do U guud, U laf at us, and wun't lisen, which proovs how much
yuur flatery is wurth." Amy spoek biterly, and turnd her bak on
th exasperaeting marter at her feet.</p>

<p>In a mienuet a hand caem doun oever th paej, so that she cuud
not draw, and Laurie's vois sed, with a droel imitaeshon of a penitent
chield,—</p>

<p>"I wil be guud, o, I wil be guud!"</p>

<p>But Amy did not laf, for she wuz in urnest; and, taping on th
outspred hand with her pensil, sed soeberly,—</p>

<p>"Aren't U ashamed of a hand liek that? It's as soft and whiet
as a wuuman's, and luuks as if it never did anything but waer Jouvin's
best gluvs, and pik flowers for laedys. U ar not a dandy, thank
Heven! so I'm glad to see thaer ar no diemonds or big seel-rings on
it, oenly th litl oeld wun Jo gaev U so long ago. Deer soel, I wish
she wuz heer to help me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">490</span>
"So do I!"</p>

<p>Th hand vanisht as sudenly as it caem, and thaer wuz enerjy
enough in th eco of her wish to suit eeven Amy. She glanst doun
at him with a nue thaut in her miend; but he wuz lieing with his hat
haf oever his faess, as if for shaed, and his mustash hid his mouth.
She oenly saw his chest riez and faul, with a long breth that miet hav
been a sie, and th hand that wor th ring nesld doun into th
gras, as if to hied sumthing too precious or too tender to be spoeken
of. All in a mienuet vaerius hints and trifles asuemd shaep and significanss
in Amy's miend, and toeld her whut her sister never had confieded
to her. She rememberd that Laurie never spoek voluntaerily of Jo;
she recauld th shado on his faess just now, th chaenj in his carrakter,
and th waering of th litl oeld ring, which wuz no ornament to
a handsum hand. Gurls ar qik to red such siens and feel thaer
eloquence. Amy had fansyd that perhaps a luv trubl wuz at th
bottom of th aulteraeshon, and now she wuz shuur of it. Her keen ies
fild, and, when she spoek again, it wuz in a vois that cuud be beautifully
soft and kiend when she choez to maek it so.</p>

<p>"I noe I hav no riet to tauk so to U, Laurie; and if U
weren't th sweetest-temperd felo in th wurld, U'd be verry
anggry with me. But we ar all so fond and proud of U, I couldn't
baer to think thae should be disapointed in U at hoem as I hav
been, tho, perhaps, thae wuud understand th chaenj beter than
I do."</p>

<p>"I think thae wuud," caem from under th hat, in a grim toen,
qiet as tuching as a broeken wun.</p>

<p>"Thae aut to hav toeld me, and not let me go blundering and
scoelding, when I should hav been mor kiend and paeshent than ever.
I never did liek that Mis Randal, and now I haet her!" sed artful
Amy, wishing to be shuur of her fakts this tiem.</p>

<p>"Hang Mis Randal!" and Laurie nokt th hat off his faess with
a luuk that left no dout of his sentiments tord that yung laedy.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon; I thaut—" and thaer she paused diplomatikaly.</p>

<p>"No, U didn't; U knew perfectly wel I never caerd for any
wun but Jo." Laurie sed that in his oeld, impechu’us toen, and turnd
his faess away as he spoek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">491</span>
"I did think so; but as thae never sed anything about it, and U
caem away, I supoezd I wuz mistaeken. And Jo wouldn't be kiend to
U? Whi, I wuz shuur she luvd U deerly."</p>

<p>"She <em>wuz</em> kiend, but not in th riet wae; and it's luky for her
she didn't luv me, if I'm th guud-for-nuthing felo U think me.
It's her fault, tho, and U mae tel her so."</p>

<p>Th hard, biter luuk caem bak again as he sed that, and it
trubld Amy, for she did not noe whut balm to aplie.</p>

<p>"I wuz rong, I didn't noe. I'm verry sorry I wuz so cros, but
I can't help wishing U'd baer it beter, Teddy, deer."</p>

<p>"Don't, that's her naem for me!" and Laurie put up his hand
with a qik jescher to stop th wurds spoeken in Jo's haf-kiend, haf-reproechful
toen. "Waet till U've tried it yuurself," he aded, in a
loe vois, as he puuld up th gras by th handfuul.</p>

<p>"I'd taek it manfuly, and be respekted if I couldn't be luvd,"
sed Amy, with th desizhon of wun hoo knew nuthing about it.</p>

<p>Now, Laurie flaterd himself that he <em>had</em> borne it remarkably wel,
maeking no moen, asking no simpathy, and taeking his trubl away to
liv it doun aloen. Amy's lecture put th mater in a nue liet, and
for th furst tiem it did luuk week and selfish to looz hart at th furst
faeluer, and shut himself up in moody indiferens. He felt as if sudenly
shaeken out of a pensiv dreem, and found it imposibl to go
to sleep again. Prezently he sat up, and askt sloely,—</p>

<p>"Do U think Jo wuud despiez me as U do?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if she saw U now. She haets laezy peepl. Whi don't
U do sumthing splendid, and <em>maek</em> her luv U?"</p>

<p>"I did mi best, but it wuz no uez."</p>

<p>"Grajuaeting wel, U meen? That wuz no mor than U aut
to hav dun, for yuur grandfaather's saek. It wuud hav been
shaemful to fael after spending so much tiem and muny, when every
wun knew U <em>cuud</em> do wel."</p>

<p>"I did fael, sae whut U wil, for Jo wouldn't luv me," began
Laurie, leening his hed on his hand in a despondent atitued.</p>

<p>"No, U didn't, and U'll sae so in th end, for it did U guud,
and proovd that U cuud do sumthing if U tried. If U'd oenly
set about anuther task of sum sort, U'd soon be yuur harty,
hapy self again, and forget yuur trubl."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">492</span>
"That's imposibl."</p>

<p>"Tri it and see. U needn't shrug yuur shoulders, and think,
'Much she noes about such things.' I don't pretend to be wiez, but
I <em>am</em> obzurving, and I see a graet deel mor than U'd imajin. I'm
interested in uther peepl's expeeri’enses and inconsistensys; and,
tho I can't explaen, I remember and uez them for mi oen benefit.
Luv Jo all yuur daes, if U chooz, but don't let it spoil U, for it's
wiked to thro away so meny guud gifts because U can't hav th
wun U wont. Thaer, I wun't lecture any mor, for I noe U'll
waek up and be a man in spiet of that hardharted gurl."</p>

<p>Neether spoek for several minits. Laurie sat turning th litl
ring on his fingger, and Amy put th last tuches to th hasty skech she
had been wurking at whiel she taukt. Prezently she put it on his
nee, meerly saeing,—</p>

<p>"How do U liek that?"</p>

<p>He luukt and then he smield, as he cuud not wel help dooing, for
it wuz capitally dun,—th long, laezy figuer on th gras, with listles
faess, haf-shut ies, and wun hand hoelding a sigar, from which caem
th litl reeth of smoek that encircled th dreemer's hed.</p>

<p>"How wel U draw!" he sed, with jenuein serpriez and plezher
at her skil, ading, with a haf-laf,—</p>

<p>"Yes, that's me."</p>

<p>"As U ar: this is as U wer;" and Amy laed anuther skech
besied th wun he held.</p>

<p>It wuz not neerly so wel dun, but thaer wuz a lief and spirit in it
which atoned for meny faults, and it recauld th past so vividly that a
suden chaenj swept oever th yung man's faess as he luukt. Oenly
a ruf skech of Laurie taeming a horss; hat and coet wer off, and
every lien of th aktiv figuer, rezoloot faess, and comanding atitued,
wuz fuul of enerjy and meening. Th handsum broot, just subdued,
stuud arching his nek under th tightly drawn raen, with wun fuut impaeshently
pawing th ground, and eers prikt up as if lisening for th
vois that had masterd him. In th rufld maen, th rieder's breezy
haer and erekt atitued, thaer wuz a sugjeschon of sudenly arest
moeshon, of strength, curej, and yoothful buoyancy, that contrasted
sharply with th supine graess of th "<i>Dolce far niente</i>" skech.
<span class="pagenum2">493</span>
Laurie sed nuthing; but, as his ie went from wun to th uther, Amy
saw him flush up and foeld his lips together as if he red and accepted
th litl leson she had given him. That satisfied her; and, without
waeting for him to speek, she sed, in her sprietly wae,—</p>

<p>"Don't U remember th dae U plaed Rarey with Puk, and
we all luukt on? Meg and Beth wer frietend, but Jo clapt and
pranst, and I sat on th fenss and droo U. I found that skech in
mi portfolio th uther dae, tucht it up, and kept it to sho U."</p>

<p>"Much obliejd. U've improovd imensly sinss then, and I
congrachulaet U. Mae I venture to sugjest in 'a hunymoon Paradise'
that fiev o'clok is th diner-our at yuur hoetel?"</p>

<p>Laurie roez as he spoek, returnd th pikchers with a smiel and a
boe, and luukt at his woch, as if to remiend her that eeven moral lectures
should hav an end. He tried to rezoom his former eezy, indiferent
aer, but it <em>wuz</em> an affectation now, for th rouzing had been mor
efficacious than he wuud confes. Amy felt th shaed of coldness in
his maner, and sed to herself,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">494</span>
"Now I've ofended him. Wel, if it duz him guud, I'm glad; if
it maeks him haet me, I'm sorry; but it's troo, and I can't taek bak
a wurd of it."</p>

<p>Thae laft and chated all th wae hoem; and litl Baptiste, up
behind, thaut that monsieur and mademezel wer in charming
spirits. But boeth felt il at eez; th frendly franknes wuz disturbs,
th sunshine had a shado oever it, and despiet thaer apparent gaeety,
thaer wuz a seecret discontent in th hart of eech.</p>

<p>"Shal we see U this evening, <i>mon frère</i>?" askt Amy as thae
parted at her ant's dor.</p>

<p>"Unforchunatly I hav an engaejment. <i>Au revoir, mademezel</i>,"
and Laurie bent as if to kis her hand, in th forin fashon, which
becaem him beter than meny men. Sumthing in his faess maed
Amy sae qikly and wormly,—</p>

<p>"No; be yuurself with me, Laurie, and part in th guud oeld wae.
I'd rather hav a harty English hand-shaek than all th sentimental
saluetaeshons in France."</p>

<p>"Guud-by, deer," and with thees wurds, uterd in th toen she
liked, Laurie left her, after a hand-shaek aulmoest paenful in its hartynes.</p>

<p>Next morning, insted of th uezhual call, Amy reseevd a noet which
maed her smiel at th begining and sie at th end:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent smc">"Mi deer Mentor,—</p>

<p>"Pleez maek mi adieux to yuur ant, and exult within yuurself,
for 'Laezy Laurence' has gon to his grandpa, liek th best of boys.
A plezant winter to U, and mae th gods grant U a blissful hunymoon
at Valrosa! I think Fred wuud be benefited by a rouser.

<p>"Guud boy! I'm glad he's gon," sed Amy, with an aprooving
smiel; th next mienuet her faess fel as she glanst about th empty

<p>"Yes, I <em>am</em> glad, but how I shal mis him!"</p>

<p class="h2a">Th Valy OF Th Shado.</p>

<p><span class="smc">When</span> th furst bitterness 
wuz oever, th family accepted th inevitabl, and tried to baer it 
cheerfuly, helping wun anuther by th increest affection which 
cums to biend hous-hoelds tenderly together in times of trubl.
Thae put away thaer greef, and eech did his or her part
tord maeking that last yeer a hapy wun.</p>

<p>Th plezantest room in th hous wuz set apart for Beth, and in it
wuz gatherd everything that she moest luvd,—flowers, pikchers, her
piano, th litl wurk-taebl, and th beluved puusys. Faather's best books
found thaer wae thaer, muther's eezy-chaer, Jo's desk, Amy's fienest
skeches; and every dae Meg brought her baebys on a luving pilgrimage,
to maek sunshine for Aunty Beth. John qieetly set apart a litl
<span class="pagenum2">496</span>
sum, that he miet enjoy th plezher of keeping th invalid suplied
with th froot she luvd and longed for; oeld Hannah never wearied
of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious apetiet, droping
teers as she wurkt; and from acros th see caem litl gifts and
cheerful leters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fraegranss
from lands that noe no winter.</p>

<p>Heer, cherrisht liek a hous-hoeld saent in its shrien, sat Beth, tranquil
and busy as ever; for nuthing cuud chaenj th sweet, unselfish
naechuur, and eeven whiel prepaering to leev lief, she tried to maek it
hapyer for thoes hoo should remaen behind. Th feebl finggers wer
never iedl, and wun of her plezhers wuz to maek litl things for th
scool-children daily pasing to and fro,—to drop a paer of mitens
from her windo for a paer of purpl hands, a needl-book for sum
small muther of meny dols, pen-wipers for yung penmen toiling
thru forests of pot-huuks, scrap-books for pikcher-luving ies, and
all maner of plezant devieses, till th reluktant cliemers up th lader
of lurning found thaer wae stroon with flowers, as it wer, and
caem to regard th jentl giver as a sort of faery godmuther, hoo sat
abuv thaer, and showered doun gifts miracuelusly suited to thaer
taests and needs. If Beth had wontedw any reword, she found it in th
briet litl faeses aulwaes turnd up to her windo, with nods and
smiels, and th droel litl leters which caem to her, fuul of blots and
gratitood.</p>

<p>Th furst fue munths wer verry hapy wuns, and Beth ofen uezd to
luuk round, and sae "How buetiful this is!" as thae all sat together
in her suny room, th baebys kiking and croeing on th flor,
muther and sisters wurking neer, and faather reeding, in his plezant
vois, from th wiez oeld books which seemd rich in guud and comfortable
wurds, as aplicabl now as when riten sencherys ago; a
litl chapel, whaer a paturnal preest taut his flok th hard lesons
all must lurn, trieing to sho them that hoep can cumfort luv, and
faeth maek rezignaeshon posibl. Simpl surmons, that went straet to
th soels of thoes hoo lisend; for th faather's hart wuz in th
minister's relijon, and th freeqent faulter in th vois gaev a dubl
eloquence to th wurds he spoek or red.</p>

<p>It wuz wel for all that this peaceful tiem wuz given them as preparaeshon
<span class="pagenum2">497</span>
for th sad ours to cum; for, by and by, Beth sed th
needl wuz "so hevy," and put it doun forever; tauking wearied
her, faeses trubld her, paen claemd her for its oen, and her tranquil
spirit wuz sorroefuly perturbed by th ils that vext her feebl flesh.
Ah me! such hevy daes, such long, long niets, such aeking harts
and imploring praers, when thoes hoo luvd her best wer forst to
see th thin hands strecht out to them beseechingly, to heer th
biter cri, "Help me, help me!" and to feel that thaer wuz no help.
A sad eclips of th sereen soel, a sharp strugl of th yung lief
with deth; but boeth wer mursyfuly brief, and then, th nacheral
rebelyon oever, th oeld peess returnd mor buetiful than ever.
With th rek of her frael body, Beth's soel groo strong; and,
tho she sed litl, thoes about her felt that she wuz redy, saw
that th furst pilgrim called wuz liekwiez th fittest, and waeted with
her on th shor, trieing to see th Shiening Wuns cuming to reseev
her when she crost th river.</p>

<p>Jo never left her for an our sinss Beth had sed, "I feel strongger
when U ar heer." She slept on a couch in th room, waeking ofen
to renue th fier, to feed, lift, or waet upon th paeshent creecher hoo
seldom askt for anything, and "tried not to be a trubl." All dae
she haunted th room, jelus of any uther nurss, and prouder of
being choezen then than of any onor her lief ever brought her. Precious
and helpful ours to Jo, for now her hart reseevd th teeching
that it needed; lesons in paeshenss wer so sweetly taut her that she
cuud not fael to lurn them; charrity for all, th luvly spirit that can
forgiv and truly forget unkiendnes, th loyalty to duty that maeks
th hardest eezy, and th sincere faeth that feers nuthing, but trusts
undoubtingly.</p>

<p>Ofen, when she woek, Jo found Beth reeding in her wel-worn
litl book, hurd her singing softly, to begiel th sleepless niet, or
saw her leen her faess upon her hands, whiel slo teers dropt
thru th transpaerent finggers; and Jo wuud lie woching her, with
thoughts too deep for teers, feeling that Beth, in her simpl, unselfish
wae, wuz trieing to ween herself from th deer oeld lief, and fit herself
for th lief to cum, by saecred wurds of cumfort, qieet praers, and
th muezik she luvd so wel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">498</span>
Seeing this did mor for Jo than th wiezest surmons, th saintliest
hims, th moest furvent praers that any vois cuud uter; for, with
ies maed cleer by meny teers, and a hart sofend by th tenderest
sorro, she recogniezd th buety of her sister's lief,—uneventful, unambitious,
yet fuul of th jenuein vurchoos which "smel sweet, and
blossom in th dust," th self-forgetfulnes that maeks th humblest
on urth rememberd soonest in heven, th troo success which is
posibl to all.</p>

<p>Wun niet, when Beth luukt amung th books upon her taebl, to
fiend sumthing to maek her forget th mortal weerynes that wuz
aulmoest as hard to baer as paen, as she turnd th leevs of her oeld
faevorit Pilgrim's Progres, she found a litl paeper, scribld oever in
Jo's hand. Th naem caut her ie, and th blurred luuk of th
liens maed her shuur that teers had faulen on it.</p>

<p>"Puur Jo! she's fast asleep, so I wun't waek her to ask leev; she
shoes me all her things, and I don't think she'll miend if I luuk at
this," thaut Beth, with a glanss at her sister, hoo lae on th
rug, with th tongs besied her, redy to waek up th mienuet th log
fel apart.</p>

</div>

<p>Blurred and bloted, faulty and feebl, as th liens wer, thae
brought a luuk of inexpresibl cumfort to Beth's faess, for her wun
regret had been that she had dun so litl; and this seemd to ashuur
her that her lief had not been uesles, that her deth wuud not
bring th despaer she feerd. As she sat with th paeper foelded
between her hands, th chard log fel asunder. Jo started up,
revievd th blaez, and crept to th bedside, hoeping Beth slept.</p>

<p>"Not asleep, but so hapy, deer. See, I found this and red it; I
knew U wouldn't caer. Hav I been all that to U, Jo?" she
askt, with wistful, humbl urnestly.</p>

<p>"O Beth, so much, so much!" and Jo's hed went doun upon
th pilo, besied her sister's.</p>

<p>"Then I don't feel as if I'd waested mi lief. I'm not so guud as
U maek me, but I <em>hav</em> tried to do riet; and now, when it's too
<span class="pagenum2">500</span>
laet to begin eeven to do beter, it's such a cumfort to noe that sum
wun luvs me so much, and feels as if I'd helpt them."</p>

<p>"Mor than any wun in th wurld, Beth. I uezd to think I
couldn't let U go; but I'm lurning to feel that I don't looz U;
that U'll be mor to me than ever, and deth can't part us, tho
it seems to."</p>

<p>"I noe it cannot, and I don't feer it any longer, for I'm shuur I
shal be yuur Beth still, to luv and help U mor than ever. U
must taek mi plaess, Jo, and be everything to faather and muther when
I'm gon. Thae wil turn to U, don't fael them; and if it's hard to
wurk aloen, remember that I don't forget U, and that U'll be
hapyer in dooing that than rieting splendid books or seeing all th
wurld; for luv is th oenly thing that we can carry with us when we
go, and it maeks th end so eezy."</p>

<p>"I'll tri, Beth;" and then and thaer Jo renounst her oeld ambishon,
plejd herself to a nue and beter wun, aknolejing th
poverty of uther deziers, and feeling th blest solis of a beleef in
th imortality of luv.</p>

<p>So th spring daes caem and went, th ski groo cleerer, th urth
greener, th flowers wer up faer and eerly, and th burds caem bak
in tiem to sae guud-by to Beth, hoo, liek a tierd but trustful chield,
clung to th hands that had led her all her lief, as faather and muther
gieded her tenderly thru th Valy of th Shado, and gaev her
up to God.</p>

<p>Seldom, exsept in books, do th dieing uter memorabl wurds, see
vizhons, or depart with beatified countenances; and thoes hoo hav
sped meny parting soels noe that to moest th end cums as nacheraly
and simply as sleep. As Beth had hoept, th "tied went out
eezily;" and in th dark our befor th daun, on th bosom whaer
she had drawn her furst breth, she qieetly droo her last, with no faerwel
but wun luving luuk, wun litl sie.</p>

<p>With teers and praers and tender hands, muther and sisters maed

<p class="h2a">Lurning TO FORGET.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Amy's</span> lecture did Laurie guud, tho, of corss, he did not oen
it till long afterward; men seldom do, for when wimen ar th advisers,
th lords of creaeshon don't taek th advice till thae hav persuaded
themselvs that it is just whut thae intended to do; then thae
akt upon it, and, if it succeeds, thae giv th weeker vesel haf
th credit of it; if it faels, thae jenerusly giv her th hoel. Laurie
went bak to his grandfaather, and wuz so dutifully devoeted for several
weeks that th oeld jentlman declaerd th cliemat of Niess had improovd
him wunderfuly, and he had beter tri it again. Thaer wuz
nuthing th yung jentlman wuud hav liked beter, but elefants
cuud not hav dragd him bak after th scoelding he had reseevd;
pride forbid, and whenever th longing groo verry strong, he fortified
<span class="pagenum2">503</span>
his rezolooshon by repeeting th wurds that had maed th deepest impreshon,
"I despiez U;" "Go and do sumthing splendid that wil
<em>maek</em> her luv U."</p>

<p>Laurie turnd th mater oever in his miend so ofen that he soon
brought himself to confes that he <em>had</em> been selfish and laezy; but then
when a man has a graet sorro, he should be induljd in all sorts of
vaegarys till he has livd it doun. He felt that his blieted affections
wer qiet ded now; and, tho he should never seess to be a
faethful morner, thaer wuz no ocaezhon to waer his weeds ostentatiously.
Jo <em>wouldn't</em> luv him, but he miet <em>maek</em> her respekt and admier
him by dooing sumthing which should proov that a gurl's "No" had
not spoilt his lief. He had aulwaes ment to do sumthing, and Amy's
advice wuz qiet unnesesaery. He had oenly been waeting till th
aforesaid blieted affections wer deesently inturd; that being dun,
he felt that he wuz redy to "hied his striken hart, and still toil on."</p>

<p>As Goethe, when he had a joy or a greef, put it into a song, so Laurie
rezolvd to embalm his luv-sorro in muezik, and compoez a Reqi’em
which should harro up Jo's soel and melt th hart of every heerer.
Thaerfor th next tiem th oeld jentlman found him geting restles
and moody, and orderd him off, he went to Vienna, whaer he had
muezikal frends, and fel to wurk with th furm deturminaeshon to distingwish
himself. But, whether th sorro wuz too vast to be embodied
in muezik, or muezik too etheerial to uplift a mortal wo, he soon discuverd
that th Reqi’em wuz beyond him, just at prezent. It wuz evident
that his miend wuz not in wurking order yet, and his iedeeas needed
claerifieing; for ofen in th midl of a plaentiv straen, he wuud fiend
himself huming a dansing tuen that vividly recauld th Christmas
baul at Niess, especially th stout Frenchman, and put an effectual stop
to trajik compozishon for th tiem being.</p>

<p>Then he tried an Opera, for nuthing seemd imposibl in th begining;
but heer, again, unforeseen dificultys beset him. He wontedw
Jo for his herroein, and called upon his memory to suplie him with
tender recolekshons and roemantik vizhons of his luv. But memory
turnd traitor; and, as if possessed by th pervurss spirit of th gurl,
wuud oenly recaul Jo's oditys, faults, and freeks, wuud oenly sho her
in th moest unsentimental aspekts,—beeting mats with her hed tied
<span class="pagenum2">504</span>
up in a bandanna, barricading herself with th soefa-pilo, or throeing
coeld wauter oever his pashon <i>à laa</i> Gummidge,—and an 
irezistibl laf spoilt th pensiv pikcher he wuz endevoring to 
paent. Jo wouldn't be put into th Opera at any priess, and he had to giv 
her up with a "Bles that gurl, whut a torment she is!" and a clutch at 
his haer, as becaem a distracted compoezer.</p>

<p>When he luukt about him for anuther and a les intraktabl damsel
to imortaliez in melody, memory produced wun with th moest
obliejing redynes. This fantom wor meny faeses, but it aulwaes had
goelden haer, wuz enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floeted airily
befor his miend's ie in a pleezing caeos of roezes, peacocks, whiet
ponies, and bloo ribons. He did not giv th complacent raeth any
naem, but he tuuk her for his herroein, and groo qiet fond of her, as
wel he miet; for he gifted her with every gift and graess under th
sun, and escorted her, unscaethd, thru trieals which wuud hav anieilaeted
any mortal wuuman.</p>

<p>Thanks to this inspiraeshon, he got on swimmingly for a tiem, but
grajualy th wurk lost its charm, and he forgot to compoez, whiel he
sat muezing, pen in hand, or roemd about th gae sity to get nue iedeeas
and refreshes his miend, which seemd to be in a sumwhot unsetld
staet that winter. He did not do much, but he thaut a graet deel
and wuz conshus of a chaenj of sum sort going on in spiet of himself.
"It's jeenyus simering, perhaps. I'll let it simer, and see
whut cums of it," he sed, with a seecret suspishon, all th whiel, that
it wasn't jeenyus, but sumthing far mor common. Whotever it wuz,
it simerd to sum purpos, for he groo mor and mor discontented
with his desultory lief, began to long for sum reeal and urnest wurk
to go at, soel and body, and fienaly caem to th wiez concloozhon that
every wun hoo luvd muezik wuz not a compoezer. Returning from wun
of Mozart's grand operas, splendidly performed at th Royal Theeater,
he luukt oever his oen, plaed a fue of th best parts, sat staering up
at th busts of Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, hoo staerd benignly
bak again; then sudenly he tore up his muezik-sheets, wun by wun,
and, as th last fluttered out of his hand, he sed soeberly to himself,—
</p>
<p>
"She is riet! Talent isn't jeenyus, and U can't maek it so.
<span class="pagenum2">505</span>
That muezik has taeken th vanity out of me as Rome tuuk it out of her,
and I wun't be a humbug any longer. Now whut shal I do?"</p>

<p>That seemd a hard qeschon to anser, and Laurie began to
wish he had to wurk for his daily bred. Now, if ever, ocurd an
eligible oportuenity for "going to th devil," as he wunss forsibly exprest
it, for he had plenty of muny and nuthing to do, and Saetan
is provurbialy fond of providing employment for fuul and iedl hands.
Th puur felo had temptaeshons enough from without and from within,
but he withstuud them prity wel; for, much as he valued liberty, he
valued guud faeth and confidenss mor, so his promis to his grandfaather,
and his dezier to be aebl to luuk onestly into th ies of th
wimen hoo luvd him, and sae "All's wel," kept him saef and steady.</p>

<p>Verry liekly sum Mrs. Grundy wil obzurv, "I don't beleev it;
boys wil be boys, yung men must soe thaer wield oets, and wimen
must not expect mirakls." I daer sae <em>U</em> don't, Mrs. Grundy, but
it's troo nevertheles. Wimen wurk a guud meny mirakls, and I hav
a persuasion that thae mae perform eeven that of raezing th standard
of manhuud by refuezing to eco such saeings. Let th boys be boys,
th longer th beter, and let th yung men soe thaer wield oets if
thae must; but muthers, sisters, and frends mae help to maek th crop
a small wun, and keep meny tares from spoiling th harvest, by beleeving,
and shoeing that thae beleev, in th posibility of loyalty to th
vurchoos which maek men manlyest in guud wimen's ies. If it <em>is</em> a
feminine deloozhon, leev us to enjoy it whiel we mae, for without it
haf th buety and th roemanss of lief is lost, and sorroeful forebodings
wuud embitter all our hoeps of th braev, tender-hearted litl
lads, hoo still luv thaer muthers beter than themselvs, and ar not
ashamed to oen it.</p>

<p>Laurie thaut that th task of forgeting his luv for Jo wuud absorb
all his powers for yeers; but, to his graet serpriez, he discuverd
it groo eezyer every dae. He refuezd to beleev it at furst, got
anggry with himself, and couldn't understand it; but thees harts of
ours ar cuerius and contraery things, and tiem and naechuur wurk thaer
wil in spiet of us. Laurie's hart <em>wouldn't</em> aek; th woond persisted
in heeling with a rapidity that astonisht him, and, insted of trieing
to forget, he found himself trieing to remember. He had not forseen
<span class="pagenum2">506</span>
this turn of affairs, and wuz not prepaerd for it. He wuz disgusted
with himself, serpriezd at his oen fiklnes, and fuul of a qeer mixcher
of disapointment and releef that he cuud recuver from such a
tremendous blo so soon. He carefully sturd up th embers of his
lost luv, but thae refuezd to burst into a blaez: thaer wuz oenly a
comfortable glo that wormd and did him guud without putting him
into a feever, and he wuz reluktantly obliejd to confes that th boyish
pashon wuz sloely subsiding into a mor tranquil sentiment, verry tender,
a litl sad and rezentful still, but that wuz shuur to pas away in
tiem, leeving a brutherly affection which wuud last unbroeken to th end.</p>

<p>As th wurd "brutherly" past thru his miend in wun of thees
reverys, he smield, and glanst up at th pikcher of Mozart that wuz
befor him:—</p>

<p>"Wel, he wuz a graet man; and when he couldn't hav wun sister
he tuuk th uther, and wuz hapy."</p>

<p>Laurie did not uter th wurds, but he thaut them; and th next
instant kist th litl oeld ring, saeing to himself,—</p>

<p>"No, I wun't! I haeven't forgoten, I never can. I'll tri again, and
if that faels, whi, then—"</p>

<p>Leeving his sentenss unfinisht, he seezd pen and paeper and roet
to Jo, teling her that he cuud not setl to anything whiel thaer wuz
th leest hoep of her chaenjing her miend. Couldn't she, wouldn't
she, and let him cum hoem and be hapy? Whiel waeting for an
anser he did nuthing, but he did it enerjetikaly, for he wuz in a
feever of impaeshenss. It caem at last, and setld his miend effectually
on wun pointer, for Jo decidedly couldn't and wouldn't. She wuz
rapt up in Beth, and never wisht to heer th wurd "luv" again.
Then she begd him to be hapy with sumbody else, but aulwaes to
keep a litl corner of his hart for his luving sister Jo. In a postscript
she dezierd him not to tel Amy that Beth wuz wurss; she wuz
cuming hoem in th spring, and thaer wuz no need of saddening th
remaender of her stae. That wuud be tiem enough, pleez God, but
Laurie must riet to her ofen, and not let her feel loenly, hoemsik,
or anxious.</p>

<p>"So I wil, at wunss. Puur litl gurl; it wil be a sad going hoem
for her, I'm afraed;" and Laurie oepend his desk, as if rieting to
<span class="pagenum2">507</span>
Amy had been th proper concloozhon of th sentenss left unfinisht
sum weeks befor.</p>

<p>But he did not riet th leter that dae; for, as he rumejd out his
best paeper, he caem acros sumthing which chaenjd his purpos.
Tumbling about in wun part of th desk, amung bils, passports, and
business docuements of vaerius kiends, wer several of Jo's leters, and
in anuther compartment wer three noets from Amy, carefully tied up
with wun of her bloo ribons, and sweetly suggestive of th litl ded
roezes put away insied. With a haf-repentant, haf-amuezd expreshon,
Laurie gatherd up all Jo's leters, smoothd, foelded, and put them
neetly into a small drawer of th desk, stuud a mienuet turning th
ring thautfuly on his fingger, then sloely droo it off, laed it with th
<span class="pagenum2">508</span>
leters, locked th drawer, and went out to heer Hie Mas at Saent
Stefan's, feeling as if thaer had been a fueneral; and, tho not oeverwhelmd
with aflikshon, this seemd a mor proper wae to spend th
rest of th dae than in rieting leters to charming yung laedys.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p>Th leter went verry soon, however, and wuz promptly anserd,
for Amy <em>wuz</em> hoemsik, and confest it in th moest delietfuly confieding
maner. Th corespondenss flurisht faemusly, and leters
floo to and fro, with unfaeling reguelarrity, all thru th eerly spring.
Laurie soeld his busts, maed allumettes of his opera, and went bak to
Paris, hoeping sumbody wuud arrive befor long. He wontedw desperatly
to go to Niess, but wuud not till he wuz askt; and Amy
wuud not ask him, for just then she wuz having litl expeeri’enses of
her oen, which maed her rather wish to avoid th qizikal ies
of "our boy."</p>

<p>Fred Vaughn had returnd, and put th qeschon to which she had
wunss desieded to anser "Yes, thank U;" but now she sed, "No,
thank U," kiendly but steadily; for, when th tiem caem, her curej
faeld her, and she found that sumthing mor than muny and
pozishon wuz needed to satisfi th nue longing that fild her hart
so fuul of tender hoeps and feers. Th wurds, "Fred is a guud felo,
but not at all th man I fansyd U wuud ever liek," and Laurie's
faess when he uterd them, kept returning to her as pertinaciously as
her oen did when she sed in luuk, if not in wurds, "I shal marry
for muny." It trubld her to remember that now, she wisht she
cuud taek it bak, it sounded so unwuumanly. She didn't wont
Laurie to think her a hartles, wurldly creecher; she didn't caer to
be a qeen of soesieety now haf so much as she did to be a luvabl
wuuman; she wuz so glad he didn't haet her for th dredful things
she sed, but tuuk them so beautifully, and wuz kiender than ever.
His leters wer such a cumfort, for th hoem leters wer verry ireguelar,
and wer not haf so satisfaktory as his when thae did cum. It
wuz not oenly a plezher, but a duty to anser them, for th puur felo
wuz forlorn, and needed peting, sinss Jo persisted in being stoeny-hearted.
She aut to hav maed an efort, and tried to luv him;
it couldn't be verry hard, meny peepl wuud be proud and glad to
hav such a deer boy caer for them; but Jo never wuud akt liek
<span class="pagenum2">509</span>
uther gurls, so thaer wuz nuthing to do but be verry kiend, and treat him
liek a bruther.</p>

<p>If all bruthers wer treated as wel as Laurie wuz at this period, thae
wuud be a much hapyer raess of beings than thae ar. Amy never
lectured now; she askt his opinyon on all subjekts; she wuz interested
in everything he did, maed charming litl prezents for him, and
sent him too leters a week, fuul of lievly gosip, sisterly confidenses,
and captivaeting skeches of th luvly seens about her. As fue
bruthers ar complimented by having thaer leters carried about in
thaer sisters' pokets, red and re-red dilijently, cried oever when
short, kist when long, and treasured carefully, we wil not hint that
Amy did any of thees fond and foolish things. But she surtenly did
gro a litl pale and pensiv that spring, lost much of her relish for
soesieety, and went out skeching aloen a guud deel. She never had
much to sho when she caem hoem, but wuz studying naechuur, I daer
sae, whiel she sat for ours, with her hands foelded, on th terris at
Valrosa, or absently skecht any fansy that ocurd to her,—a staulwart
niet carvd on a toom, a yung man asleep in th gras, with
his hat oever his ies, or a curly-haired gurl in gorjus arae, promenading
doun a baul-room on th arm of a taul jentlman, boeth faeses
being left a blur acording to th last fashon in art, which wuz saef,
but not aultogether satisfaktory.</p>

<p>Her ant thaut that she regreted her anser to Fred; and, fiending
denieals uesles and explanaeshons imposibl, Amy left her to think
whut she liked, taeking caer that Laurie should noe that Fred had
gon to Egypt. That wuz all, but he understuud it, and luukt releevd,
as he sed to himself, with a venerable aer,—</p>

<p>"I wuz shuur she wuud think beter of it. Puur oeld felo! I've
been thru it all, and I can sympathize."</p>

<p>With that he heevd a graet sie, and then, as if he had discharjd
his duty to th past, put his feet up on th soefa, and enjoyd Amy's
leter lugzhuriusly.</p>

<p>Whiel thees chaenjes wer going on abraud, trubl had cum at
hoem; but th leter teling that Beth wuz faeling never reached Amy,
and when th next found her, th gras wuz green abuv her sister.
Th sad nues met her at Vevay, for th heet had driven them from
<span class="pagenum2">510</span>
Niess in Mae, and thae had travelled sloely to Switzerland, by wae of
Genoa and th Italian laeks. She bor it verry wel, and qieetly submitted
to th family decree that she should not shorten her vizit, for,
sinss it wuz too laet to sae guud-by to Beth, she had beter stae, and
let absence sofen her sorro. But her hart wuz verry hevy; she
longed to be at hoem, and every dae luukt wistfuly acros th laek,
waeting for Laurie to cum and cumfort her.</p>

<p>He did cum verry soon; for th saem mael brought leters to them
boeth, but he wuz in Germany, and it tuuk sum daes to reech him.
Th moement he red it, he pakt his napsak, bade adieu to his
felo-pedestrians, and wuz off to keep his promis, with a hart fuul
of joy and sorro, hoep and suspenss.</p>

<p>He knew Vevay wel; and as soon as th boet tucht th litl
kee, he huryd along th shor to Laa Tour, whaer th Carrols wer
living <i>en penshon</i>. Th <i>garçon</i> wuz in despaer that 
th hoel family had gon to taek a promenade on th laek; but no, th blond
mademezel miet be in th chateau garden. If monsieur wuud
giv himself th paen of sitting doun, a flash of tiem should prezent
her. But monsieur cuud not waet eeven "a flash of tiem," and, in th
midl of th speech, departed to fiend mademezel himself.</p>

<p>A plezant oeld garden on th borders of th luvly laek, with chestnuts
rusling oeverhed, ievy clieming everywhaer, and th blak shado
of th tower fauling far acros th suny wauter. At wun corner of th
wied, loe waul wuz a seet, and heer Amy ofen caem to red or wurk,
or consoel herself with th buety all about her. She wuz sitting heer
that dae, leening her hed on her hand, with a hoemsik hart and
hevy ies, thinking of Beth, and wundering whi Laurie did not cum.
She did not heer him cros th cort-yard beyond, nor see him pause
in th archway that led from th subterranean path into th garden.
He stuud a mienuet, luuking at her with nue ies, seeing whut no wun
had ever seen befor,—th tender sied of Amy's carrakter. Everything
about her mutely sugjested luv and sorro,—th bloted leters
in her lap, th blak ribon that tied up her haer, th wuumanly paen
and paeshenss in her faess; eeven th litl ebony cros at her throet
seemd pathetik to Laurie, for he had given it to her, and she wor it
as her oenly ornament. If he had any doubts about th resepshon she
<span class="pagenum2">511</span>
wuud giv him, thae wer set at rest th mienuet she luukt up and
saw him; for, droping everything, she ran to him, exclaeming, in a
toen of unmistaekably luv and longing,—</p>

<p>"O Laurie, Laurie, I knew U'd cum to me!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 505px;">
<a name="b178.png" id="b178.png"></a>
<img src="./LitlWimen_files/b178.png" width="505" height="400" alt="O Laurie, Laurie, I knew you&#39;d come" title="O Laurie, Laurie, I knew you&#39;d come">
</div>

<p>I think everything wuz sed and setld then; for, as thae stuud
together qiet silent for a moement, with th dark hed bent doun protectingly
oever th liet wun, Amy felt that no wun cuud cumfort and
sustaen her so wel as Laurie, and Laurie desieded that Amy wuz th
oenly wuuman in th wurld hoo cuud fil Jo's plaess, and maek him
hapy. He did not tel her so; but she wuz not disapointed, for
boeth felt th trooth, wer satisfied, and gladly left th rest to silence.</p>

<p>In a mienuet Amy went bak to her plaess; and, whiel she dried her
teers, Laurie gatherd up th scaterd paepers, fiending in th siet of
sundry wel-worn leters and suggestive skeches guud oemens for th
fuecher. As he sat doun besied her, Amy felt shi again, and turnd
roezy red at th recolekshon of her impulsiv greeting.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it; I felt so loenly and sad, and wuz so verry glad
<span class="pagenum2">512</span>
to see U. It wuz such a serpriez to luuk up and fiend U, just as I
wuz begining to feer U wouldn't cum," she sed, trieing in vaen to
speek qiet nacheraly.</p>

<p>"I caem th mienuet I hurd. I wish I cuud sae sumthing to
cumfort U for th lost of deer litl Beth; but I can oenly feel,
and—" He cuud not get any further, for he, too, turnd bashful all
of a suden, and did not qiet noe whut to sae. He longed to lae
Amy's hed doun on his shoulder, and tel her to hav a guud cri, but
he did not daer; so tuuk her hand insted, and gaev it a simpathetik
sqeez that wuz beter than wurds.</p>

<p>"U needn't sae anything; this cumforts me,"
<ins title="Add period after softly,"> 
she sed softly.</ins>
"Beth is wel and hapy, and I mustn't wish her bak; but I dred
th going hoem, much as I long to see them all. We wun't tauk about
it now, for it maeks me cri, and I wont to enjoy U whiel U stae.
U needn't go riet bak, need U?"</p>

<p>"Not if U wont me, deer."</p>

<p>"I do, so much. Ant and Flo ar verry kiend; but U seem liek
wun of th family, and it wuud be so comfortable to hav U for a
litl whiel."</p>

<p>Amy spoek and luukt so liek a hoemsik chield, hoos hart wuz
fuul, that Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at wunss, and gaev her just
whut she wontedw,—th peting she wuz uezd to and th cheerful conversation
she needed.</p>

<p>"Puur litl soel, U luuk as if U'd greevd yuurself haf-sik!
I'm going to taek caer of U, so don't cri any mor, but cum and
wauk about with me; th wiend is too chily for U to sit still," he sed,
in th haf-caressing, haf-comanding wae that Amy liked, as he tied
on her hat, droo her arm thru his, and began to paess up and doun
th suny wauk, under th nue-leaved chestnuts. He felt mor at eez
upon his legs; and Amy found it verry plezant to hav a strong arm
to leen upon, a familyar faess to smiel at her, and a kiend vois to tauk
delietfuly for her aloen.</p>

<p>Th qaent oeld garden had shelterd meny paers of luvers, and
seemd expresly maed for them, so suny and seclooded wuz it, with
nuthing but th tower to oeverluuk them, and th wied laek to carry
away th eco of thaer wurds, as it ripld by beloe. For an our
<span class="pagenum2">513</span>
this nue paer waukt and taukt, or rested on th waul, enjoying th
sweet inflooenses which gaev such a charm to tiem and plaess; and
when an unromantik diner-bel wornd them away, Amy felt as if she
left her burden of loenlynes and sorro behind her in th chateau
garden.</p>

<p>Th moement Mrs. Carrol saw th gurl's aulterd faess, she wuz iloominaeted
with a nue iedeea, and exclaemd to herself, "Now I understand it
all,—th chield has been piening for yung Laurence. Bles mi hart,
I never thaut of such a thing!"</p>

<p>With praiseworthy discreshon, th guud laedy sed nuthing, and betraed
no sien of enlightenment; but corjaly urjd Laurie to stae,
and begd Amy to enjoy his soesieety, for it wuud do her mor guud
than so much solitued. Amy wuz a model of docility; and, as her
ant wuz a guud deel ocuepied with Flo, she wuz left to entertain her
frend, and did it with mor than her uezhual success.</p>

<p>At Niess, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scoelded; at Vevay,
Laurie wuz never iedl, but aulwaes wauking, rieding, boeting, or studying,
in th moest enerjetik maner, whiel Amy admierd everything he did,
and foloed his exampl as far and as fast as she cuud. He sed th
chaenj wuz oeing to th cliemat, and she did not contradict him,
being glad of a liek excuez for her oen recuverd helth and spirits.</p>

<p>Th invigoraeting aer did them boeth guud, and much exercise wurkt
hoelsum chaenjes in miends as wel as bodys. Thae seemd to get
cleerer vues of lief and duty up thaer amung th everlasting hils;
th fresh wiends blew away desponding doubts, deloosiv fansys, and
moody mists; th worm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring
iedeeas, tender hoeps, and hapy thoughts; th laek seemd to wosh
away th trubls of th past, and th grand oeld mountens to luuk
benignly doun upon them, saeing, "Litl children, luv wun anuther."</p>

<p>In spiet of th nue sorro, it wuz a verry hapy tiem, so hapy that
Laurie cuud not baer to disturb it by a wurd. It tuuk him a litl
whiel to recuver from his serpriez at th rapid cuer of his furst, and, as
he had furmly beleevd, his last and oenly luv. He consoeld himself
for th seeming disloyalty by th thaut that Jo's sister wuz aulmoest
th saem as Jo's self, and th convikshon that it wuud hav been
<span class="pagenum2">514</span>
imposibl to luv any uther wuuman but Amy so soon and so wel.
His furst wooing had been of th tempestuous order, and he luukt
bak upon it as if thru a long vista of yeers, with a feeling of compassion
blended with regret. He wuz not ashamed of it, but put it
away as wun of th biter-sweet expeeri’enses of his lief, for which he
cuud be graetful when th paen wuz oever. His second wooing he
rezolvd should be as calm and simpl as posibl; thaer wuz no need
of having a seen, hardly any need of teling Amy that he luvd her;
she knew it without wurds, and had given him his anser long ago.
It all caem about so nacheraly that no wun cuud complaen, and he
knew that everybody wuud be pleezd, eeven Jo. But when our furst
litl pashon has been crusht, we ar apt to be waery and slo in
maeking a second trieal; so Laurie let th daes pas, enjoying every
our, and leeving to chanss th uteranss of th wurd that wuud put
an end to th furst and sweetest part of his nue roemanss.</p>

<p>He had rather imajind that th <i>dénouement</i> wuud taek 
plaess in th chateau garden by moonliet, and in th moest graesful and 
decorus maner; but it turnd out exaktly th revurss, for th mater wuz 
setld on th laek, at noondae, in a fue blunt wurds. Thae had been
floeting about all th morning, from gloomy St. Gingolf to suny
Montreux, with th Alps of Savoy on wun sied, Mont St. Bernard and
th Dent du Midi on th uther, prity Vevay in th valy, and Lausanne
upon th hil beyond, a cloudles bloo ski oeverhed, and th
bluer laek beloe, dotted with th picturesque boets that luuk liek
whiet-wingd guls.</p>

<p>Thae had been tauking of Bonnivard, as thae glieded past Chillon,
and of Rousseau, as thae luukt up at Clarens, whaer he roet his
"Héloise." Neether had red it, but thae knew it wuz a luv-story,
and eech privately wunderd if it wuz haf as interesting as thaer oen.
Amy had been dabling her hand in th wauter duuring th litl pause
that fel between them, and, when she luukt up, Laurie wuz leening
on his ors, with an expreshon in his ies that maed her sae haestily,
meerly for th saek of saeing sumthing,—</p>

<p>"U must be tierd; rest a litl, and let me row (noun); it wil do me
guud; for, sinss U caem, I hav been aultogether laezy and lugzhuurius."</p>

<p>"I'm not tierd; but U mae taek an or, if U liek. Thaer's
<span class="pagenum2">515</span>
room enough, tho I hav to sit neerly in th midl, else th boet
wun't trim," returnd Laurie, as if he rather liked th araenjment.</p>

<p>Feeling that she had not mended maters much, Amy tuuk th
oferd thurd of a seet, shuuk her haer oever her faess, and accepted an
or. She roed as wel as she did meny uther things; and, tho
she uezd boeth hands, and Laurie but wun, th ors kept tiem, and th
boet went smoothly thru th wauter.</p>

<p>"How wel we puul together, don't we?" sed Amy, hoo objekted
to silence just then.</p>

<p>"So wel that I wish we miet aulwaes puul in th saem boet. Wil
U, Amy?" verry tenderly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Laurie," verry loe.</p>

<p>Then thae boeth stopt roeing, and unconshusly aded a prity

<p><span class="smc">It</span> wuz eezy to promis self-abnegaeshon when self wuz rapt up

when th helpful vois wuz silent, th daily leson oever, th beluved
presence gon, and nuthing remaend but loenlynes and greef, then Jo
found her promis verry hard to keep. How cuud she "cumfort
faather and muther," when her oen hart aekt with a seesles longing
for her sister; how cuud she "maek th hous cheerful," when all its
liet and warmth and buety seemd to hav dezurted it when Beth
left th oeld hoem for th nue; and whaer in all th wurld cuud she
"fiend sum uesful, hapy wurk to do," that wuud taek th plaess of

burdens maed hevyer, and lief get harder and harder as she toild

it wuz not faer, for she tried mor than Amy to be guud, but never got

that never seemd to gro any eezyer. "I can't do it. I wasn't
ment for a lief liek this, and I noe I shal braek away and do sumthing
desperat if sumbody don't cum and help me," she sed to herself,
when her furst eforts faeld, and she fel into th moody, mizerabl
staet of miend which ofen cums when strong wils hav to yeeld to
th inevitabl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">517</span>
But sum wun did cum and help her, tho Jo did not recogniez
her guud aenjels at wunss, because thae wor familyar shaeps, and uezd
th simpl spels best fited to puur huemanity. Ofen she started up
at niet, thinking Beth called her; and when th siet of th litl
empty bed maed her cri with th biter cri of an unsubmissive sorro,
"O Beth, cum bak! cum bak!" she did not strech out her
yurning arms in vaen; for, as qik to heer her sobing as she
had been to heer her sister's faentest whisper, her muther caem to
cumfort her, not with wurds oenly, but th paeshent tenderness that
soothes by a tuch, teers that wer muet remienders of a graeter greef
than Jo's, and broeken whispers, mor eloquent than praers, because
hoepful rezignaeshon went hand-in-hand with nacheral sorro. Saecred
moements, when hart taukt to hart in th silence of th niet, turning
aflikshon to a blesing, which chaesend greef and strengthend
luv. Feeling this, Jo's burden seemd eezyer to baer, duty groo
sweeter, and lief luukt mor endurable, seen from th saef shelter of
her muther's arms.</p>

<p>When aeking hart wuz a litl cumforted, trubld miend liekwiez
found help; for wun dae she went to th study, and, leening oever th
guud grae hed lifted to welcum her with a tranquil smiel, she sed,
verry humbly,—</p>

<p>"Faather, tauk to me as U did to Beth. I need it mor than she
did, for I'm all rong."</p>

<p>"Mi deer, nuthing can cumfort me liek this," he anserd, with a
faulter in his vois, and boeth arms round her, as if he, too, needed
help, and did not feer to ask it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 451px;">

<img src="./LitlWimen_files/b180.png" width="451" height="400" alt="Jo and her father" title="Jo and her father">
</div>

<p>Then, sitting in Beth's litl chaer cloez besied him, Jo toeld her
trubls,—th rezentful sorro for her lost, th frootles eforts that
discurejd her, th wont of faeth that maed lief luuk so dark, and all
th sad bewilderment which we call despaer. She gaev him entier
confidenss, he gaev her th help she needed, and boeth found consolaeshon
in th akt; for th tiem had cum when thae cuud tauk together
not oenly as faather and dauter, but as man and wuuman, aebl and glad
to surv eech uther with muechual simpathy as wel as muechual luv.
Hapy, thautful times thaer in th oeld study which Jo called "th
church of wun member," and from which she caem with fresh curej,
<span class="pagenum2">518</span>
recuverd cheerfulnes, and a mor submissive spirit; for th paerents
hoo had taut wun chield to meet deth without feer, wer trieing now
to teech anuther to accept lief without despondensy or distrust, and to
uez its buetiful oportuenitys with gratitood and power.</p>

<p>Uther helps had Jo,—humbl, hoelsum duties and deliets that
wuud not be denied thaer part in surving her, and which she sloely
lurnd to see and value. Brooms and dishcloths never cuud be as
distasteful as thae wunss had been, for Beth had prezieded oever boeth;
and sumthing of her housewifely spirit seemd to lingger round th
litl mop and th oeld brush, that wuz never throen away. As she
uezd them, Jo found herself huming th songs Beth uezd to hum,
imitaeting Beth's orderly waes, and giving th litl tuches heer and
thaer that kept everything fresh and cosey, which wuz th furst step
tord maeking hoem hapy, tho she didn't noe it, till Hannah
sed with an aprooving sqeez of th hand,—</p>

<p>"U thautful creter, U're deturmind we sha'n't mis that deer
lam ef U can help it. We don't sae much, but we see it, and th
Lord wil bles U for't, see ef He don't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">519</span>
As thae sat soeing together, Jo discuverd how much improovd her
sister Meg wuz; how wel she cuud tauk, how much she knew about
guud, wuumanly impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how hapy she wuz in
huzband and children, and how much thae wer all dooing for eech
uther.</p>

<p>"Marrej is an exselent thing, after all. I wunder if I should
blossom out haf as wel as U hav, if I tried it?" sed Jo, as she
construkted a kiet for Demi, in th topsy-turvy nursery.</p>

<p>"It's just whut U need to bring out th tender, wuumanly haf of
yuur naechuur, Jo. U ar liek a chestnut-burr, prickly outsied, but
silky-soft within, and a sweet curnel, if wun can oenly get at it. Luv
wil maek U sho yuur hart sum dae, and then th ruf burr wil
faul off."</p>

<p>"Frost oepens chestnut-burrs, maa'am, and it taeks a guud shaek to
bring them doun. Boys go nutting, and I don't caer to be bagd
by them," returnd Jo, paesting away at th kiet which no wiend that
bloes wuud ever carry up, for Daezy had tied herself on as a bob.</p>

<p>Meg laft, for she wuz glad to see a glimer of Jo's oeld spirit,
but she felt it her duty to enforss her opinyon by every arguement in her
power; and th sisterly chats wer not waested, especially as too of
Meg's moest efektiv arguments wer th baebys, hoom Jo luvd tenderly.
Greef is th best oepener for sum harts, and Jo's wuz neerly
redy for th bag: a litl mor sunshine to riepen th nut, then, not a
boy's impaeshent shaek, but a man's hand reached up to pik it jently
from th burr, and fiend th curnel sound and sweet. If she had suspekted
this, she wuud hav shut up tight, and been mor prickly than
ever; forchunatly she wasn't thinking about herself, so, when th tiem
caem, doun she dropt.</p>

<p>Now, if she had been th herroein of a moral story-book, she aut
at this period of her lief to hav becum qiet saently, renounst th
wurld, and gon about dooing guud in a mortified bonnet, with tracts in
her poket. But, U see, Jo wasn't a herroein; she wuz oenly a strugling
hueman gurl, liek hundreds of others, and she just akted out her
naechuur, being sad, cros, listles, or enerjetik, as th mood sugjested.
It's hiely vurchu’us to sae we'll be guud, but we can't do it all at wunss,
and it taeks a long puul, a strong puul, and a puul all together, befor
<span class="pagenum2">520</span>
sum of us eeven get our feet set in th riet wae. Jo had got so far,
she wuz lurning to do her duty, and to feel unhapy if she did not;
but to do it cheerfuly—ah, that wuz anuther thing! She had ofen
sed she wontedw to do sumthing splendid, no mater how hard; and
now she had her wish, for whut cuud be mor buetiful than to devoet
her lief to faather and muther, trieing to maek hoem as hapy to them
as thae had to her? And, if dificultys wer nesesaery to increess
th splendor of th efort, whut cuud be harder for a restles, ambishus
gurl than to giv up her oen hoeps, plans, and deziers, and cheerfuly
liv for others?</p>

<p>Providence had taeken her at her wurd; heer wuz th task, not
whut she had expected, but beter, because self had no part in it:
now, cuud she do it? She desieded that she wuud tri; and, in her furst
atempt, she found th helps I hav sugjested. Still anuther wuz given
her, and she tuuk it, not as a reword, but as a cumfort, as Christian tuuk
th refreshment afforded by th litl arbor whaer he rested, as he
cliemd th hil called Dificulty.</p>

<p>"Whi don't U riet? That aulwaes uezd to maek U hapy,"
sed her muther, wunss, when th desponding fit oevershadoed Jo.</p>

<p>"I've no hart to riet, and if I had, noebody caers for mi things."</p>

<p>"We do; riet sumthing for us, and never miend th rest of th
wurld. Tri it, deer; I'm shuur it wuud do U guud, and pleez us
verry much."</p>

<p>"Don't beleev I can;" but Jo got out her desk, and began to
overhaul her haf-finisht manuescripts.</p>

<p>An our afterward her muther peept in, and thaer she wuz, scraching
away, with her blak pinafore on, and an absorbd expreshon,
which cauzd Mrs. March to smiel, and slip away, wel pleezd with
th success of her sugjeschon. Jo never knew how it happened, but
sumthing got into that story that went straet to th harts of thoes
hoo red it; for, when her family had laft and cried oever it, her
faather sent it, much against her wil, to wun of th popuelar magazeens,
and, to her uter serpriez, it wuz not oenly paed for, but others reqested.
Leters from several pursons, hoos praez wuz onor, foloed th
apeeranss of th litl story, nuezpaepers copyd it, and straenjers as
wel as frends admierd it. For a small thing it wuz a graet success;
<span class="pagenum2">521</span>
and Jo wuz mor astonisht than when her novel wuz comended
and condemd all at wunss.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it. Whut <em>can</em> thaer be in a simpl litl story
liek that, to maek peepl praez it so?" she sed, qiet bewildered.</p>

<p>"Thaer is trooth in it, Jo, that's th seecret; huemor and pathos maek
it aliev, and U hav found yuur stiel at last. U roet with no
thaut of faem or muny, and put yuur hart into it, mi dauter;
U hav had th biter, now cums th sweet. Do yuur best, and gro
as hapy as we ar in yuur success."</p>

<p>"If thaer <em>is</em> anything guud or troo in whut I riet, it isn't mien; I
oe it all to U and muther and to Beth," sed Jo, mor tucht by
her faather's wurds than by any amount of praez from th wurld.</p>

<p>So, taut by luv and sorro, Jo roet her litl storys, and sent
them away to maek frends for themselvs and her, fiending it a verry
charritabl wurld to such humbl waanderers; for thae wer kiendly welcumd,
and sent hoem comfortable toekens to thaer muther, liek dutiful
children hoom guud forchun oevertaeks.</p>

<p>When Amy and Laurie roet of thaer engaejment, Mrs. March
feerd that Jo wuud fiend it dificult to rejois oever it, but her feers
wer soon set at rest; for, tho Jo luukt graev at furst, she tuuk it
verry qieetly, and wuz fuul of hoeps and plans for "th children" befor
she red th leter twice. It wuz a sort of riten dueet, whaerin eech
glorified th uther in luver-liek fashon, verry plezant to red and satisfaktory
to think of, for no wun had any objekshon to maek.</p>

<p>"U liek it, muther?" sed Jo, as thae laed doun th cloesly riten
sheets, and luukt at wun anuther.</p>

<p>"Yes, I hoept it wuud be so, ever sinss Amy roet that she had
refuezd Fred. I felt shuur then that sumthing beter than whut U
call th 'mursenaery spirit' had cum oever her, and a hint heer and
thaer in her leters maed me suspekt that luv and Laurie wuud win
th dae."</p>

<p>"How sharp U ar, Marmee, and how silent! U never sed a
wurd to me."</p>

<p>"Muthers hav need of sharp ies and discrete tungs when thae
hav gurls to manej. I wuz haf afraed to put th iedeea into yuur hed,
lest U should riet and congrachulaet them befor th thing wuz
setld."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">522</span>
"I'm not th scater-braen I wuz; U mae trust me, I'm soeber and
sensibl enough for any wun's <i>confidante</i> now."</p>

<p>"So U ar, deer, and I should hav maed U mien, oenly I fansyd
it miet paen U to lurn that yuur Teddy luvd any wun else."</p>

<p>"Now, muther, did U reealy think I cuud be so sily and selfish,
after I'd refuezd his luv, when it wuz freshest, if not best?"</p>

<p>"I knew U wer sincere then, Jo, but laetly I hav thaut that
if he caem bak, and askt again, U miet, perhaps, feel liek giving
anuther anser. Forgiv me, deer, I can't help seeing that U ar
verry loenly, and sumtiems thaer is a hunggry luuk in yuur ies that goes
to mi hart; so I fansyd that yuur boy miet fil th empty plaess if
he tried now."</p>

<p>"No, muther, it is beter as it is, and I'm glad Amy has lurnd to
luv him. But U ar riet in wun thing: I <em>am</em> loenly, and perhaps
if Teddy had tried again, I miet hav sed 'Yes,' not because I luv
him any mor, but because I caer mor to be luvd than when he
went away."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that, Jo, for it shoes that U ar geting on. Thaer
ar plenty to luv U, so tri to be satisfied with faather and muther,
sisters and bruthers, frends and baebys, till th best luver of all cums
to giv U yuur reword."</p>

<p>"Muthers ar th <em>best</em> luvers in th wurld; but I don't miend whispering
to Marmee that I'd liek to tri all kiends. It's verry cuerius, but
th mor I tri to satisfi mieself with all sorts of nacheral affections, th
mor I seem to wont. I'd no iedeea harts cuud taek in so meny;
mien is so elastic, it never seems fuul now, and I uezd to be qiet contented
with mi family. I don't understand it."</p>

<p>"I do;" and Mrs. March smield her wiez smiel, as Jo turnd bak
th leevs to red whut Amy sed of Laurie.</p>

<p>"It is so buetiful to be luvd as Laurie luvs me; he isn't sentimental,
doesn't sae much about it, but I see and feel it in all he sez
and duz, and it maeks me so hapy and so humbl that I don't seem
to be th saem gurl I wuz. I never knew how guud and jenerus
and tender he wuz till now, for he lets me red his hart, and I fiend it
fuul of noebl impulses and hoeps and purposes, and am so proud to
noe it's mien. He sez he feels as if he 'cuud maek a prosperous
<span class="pagenum2">523</span>
voyej now with me abord as maet, and lots of luv for balast.' I prae
he mae, and tri to be all he beleevs me, for I luv mi galant capten
with all mi hart and soel and miet, and never wil dezurt him,
whiel God lets us be together. O muther, I never knew how much
liek heven this wurld cuud be, when too peepl luv and liv for wun
anuther!"</p>

<p>"And that's our cool, rezurvd, and wurldly Amy! Truly, luv
duz wurk mirakls. How verry, verry hapy thae must be!" And
Jo laed th rusling sheets together with a careful hand, as wun miet
shut th cuvers of a luvly roemanss, which hoelds th reeder fast
till th end cums, and he fiends himself aloen in th wurk-a-dae
wurld again.</p>

<p>By and by Jo roemd away upstaers, for it wuz raeny, and she cuud
not wauk. A restles spirit possessed her, and th oeld feeling caem
again, not biter as it wunss wuz, but a sorroefuly paeshent wunder whi
wun sister should hav all she askt, th uther nuthing. It wuz not
troo; she knew that, and tried to put it away, but th nacheral craeving
for affection wuz strong, and Amy's hapynes woek th hunggry
longing for sum wun to "luv with hart and soel, and cling to whiel
God let them be together."</p>

<p>Up in th garret, whaer Jo's unqieet waanderings ended, stuud foer
litl wuuden chests in a row (noun), eech markt with its oener's naem, and
eech fild with reliks of th chieldhuud and gurlhuud ended now for
all. Jo glanst into them, and when she caem to her oen, leend her
chin on th ej, and staerd absently at th caeotik colekshon, till a
bundle of oeld exercise-books caut her ie. She droo them out,
turnd them oever, and re-livd that plezant winter at kiend Mrs. Kirke's.
She had smield at furst, then she luukt thautful, next sad, and when
she caem to a litl mesej riten in th Professor's hand, her lips
began to trembl, th books slid out of her lap, and she sat luuking
at th frendly wurds, as if thae tuuk a nue meening, and tucht a
tender spot in her hart.</p>

<p>"Waet for me, mi frend. I mae be a litl laet, but I shal surely
cum."</p>
<p>"O, if he oenly wuud! So kiend, so guud, so paeshent with me
aulwaes; mi deer oeld Fritz, I didn't value him haf enough when I had
<span class="pagenum2">524</span>
him, but now how I should luv to see him, for every wun seems going
away from me, and I'm all aloen."</p>

<p>And hoelding th litl paeper fast, as if it wer a promis yet to be
fuulfild, Jo laed her hed doun on a comfortable rag-bag, and cried,
as if in opozishon to th raen patering on th roof.</p>

Wuz it all self-pity, loenlynes, or loe spirits? or wuz it th waeking

<p><span class="smc">Jo</span> wuz aloen in th twilight, lieing on th oeld soefa, luuking at th
fier, and thinking. It wuz her faevorit wae of spending th our of
dusk; no wun disturbs her, and she uezd to lie thaer on Beth's litl
red pilo, planing storys, dreeming dreems, or thinking tender
thoughts of th sister hoo never seemd far away. Her faess luukt
tierd, graev, and rather sad; for to-morro wuz her burthdae, and she
wuz thinking how fast th yeers went by, how oeld she wuz geting, and
how litl she seemd to hav accomplished. Aulmoest twenty-fiev, and
nuthing to sho for it. Jo wuz mistaeken in that; thaer wuz a guud
deel to sho, and by and by she saw, and wuz graetful for it.</p>

<p>"An oeld maed, that's whut I'm to be. A literaery spinster, with a
pen for a spouse, a family of storys for children, and twenty yeers
<span class="pagenum2">526</span>
henss a morsel of faem, perhaps; when, liek puur Johnson, I'm oeld,
and can't enjoy it, solitaery, and can't shaer it, independent, and don't
need it. Wel, I needn't be a sour saent nor a selfish siner; and, I
daer sae, oeld maeds ar verry comfortable when thae get uezd to
it; but—" and thaer Jo sighed, as if th prospekt wuz not invieting.</p>

<p>It seldom is, at furst, and thurty seems th end of all things to fiev-and-twenty;
but it's not so bad as it luuks, and wun can get on qiet
hapily if wun has sumthing in wun's self to faul bak upon. At
twenty-fiev, gurls begin to tauk about being oeld maeds, but seecretly
rezolv that thae never wil be; at thurty thae sae nuthing about it, but
qieetly accept th fakt, and, if sensibl, consoel themselvs by remembering
that thae hav twenty mor uesful, hapy yeers, in which thae
mae be lurning to gro oeld graesfuly. Don't laf at th spinsters,
deer gurls, for ofen verry tender, tragical roemanses ar hiden away in
th harts that beet so qieetly under th soeber gouns, and meny
silent sacrifieses of yooth, helth, ambishon, luv itself, maek th faeded
faeses buetiful in God's siet. Eeven th sad, sour sisters should be
kiendly delt with, because thae hav mist th sweetest part of lief,
if for no uther reezon; and, luuking at them with compassion, not
contempt, gurls in thaer bloom should remember that thae too mae
mis th blossom tiem; that roezy cheeks don't last forever, that silver
threds wil cum in th bonnie broun haer, and that, by and by,
kiendnes and respekt wil be as sweet as luv and admeraeshon now.</p>

<p>Jentlmen, which means boys, be courteous to th oeld maeds, no
mater how puur and plaen and prim, for th oenly chivalry wurth
having is that which is th redyest to pae deferenss to th oeld,
protect th feebl, and surv wuumankiend, regardles of rank, aej, or

<p>Jo must hav faulen asleep (as I daer sae mi reeder has duuring this

substantial, liefliek goest,—leening oever her, with th verry luuk
he uezd to waer when he felt a guud deel and didn't liek to sho it.
But, liek Jeny in

th ballad,—</ins></p>

<p class="center">"She cuud not think it he,"</p>

<p class="noindent">
and lae staering up at him in startld silence, till he stoopt and
kist her. Then she knew him, and floo up, crieing joyfuly,—</p>

<p>"O mi Teddy! O mi Teddy!"</p>

<p>"Deer Jo, U ar glad to see me, then?"</p>

<p>"Glad! Mi blest boy, wurds can't expres mi gladnes. Whaer's

<p>"Yuur muther has got her doun at Meg's. We stopt thaer by

<p>"Yuur whut?" cried Jo, for Laurie uterd thoes too wurds with
an unconshus pride and satisfakshon which betraed him.</p>

<p>"O, th dickens! now I've dun it;" and he luukt so guilty
that Jo wuz doun upon him liek a flash.</p>

<p>"U've gon and got marryd!"</p>

<p>"Yes, pleez, but I never wil again;" and he went doun upon his
nees, with a penitent clasping of hands, and a faess fuul of mischif,
murth, and trieumf.</p>

<p>"Akchualy marryd?"</p>

<p>"Verry much so, thank U."</p>

<p>"Mursy on us! Whut dredful thing wil U do next?" and Jo fel
into her seet, with a gasp.</p>

<p>"A carrakteristik, but not exaktly complimentary, congrachulaeshon,"
returnd Laurie, still in an abjekt atitued, but beeming with satisfakshon.</p>

<p>"Whut can U expect, when U taek wun's breth away, creeping
in liek a burglar, and leting cats out of bags liek that? Get up, U
ridicuelus boy, and tel me all about it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">528</span>
"Not a wurd, unles U let me cum in mi oeld plaess, and promis
not to barricade."</p>

<p>Jo laft at that as she had not dun for meny a long dae, and
pated th soefa invietingly, as she sed, in a corjal toen,—</p>

<p>"Th oeld pilo is up garret, and we don't need it now; so, cum
and 'fes, Teddy."</p>

<p>"How guud it sounds to heer U sae 'Teddy'! No wun ever
calls me that but U;" and Laurie sat doun, with an aer of graet
content.</p>

<p>"Whut duz Amy call U?"</p>

<p>"Mi lord."</p>

<p>"That's liek her. Wel, U luuk it;" and Jo's ies plainly
betraed that she found her boy comelier than ever.</p>

<p>Th pilo wuz gon, but thaer <em>wuz</em> a barricade, nevertheles,—a
nacheral wun, raezd by tiem, absence, and chaenj of hart. Boeth felt
it, and for a mienuet luukt at wun anuther as if that invizibl barrier
cast a litl shado oever them. It wuz gon direktly, however, for
Laurie sed, with a vaen atempt at dignity,—</p>

<p>"Don't I luuk liek a marryd man and th hed of a family?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit, and U never wil. U've groen biger and bonnier,
but U ar th saem scaepgraess as ever."</p>

<p>"Now, reealy, Jo, U aut to treat me with mor respekt," began
Laurie, hoo enjoyd it all imensly.</p>

<p>"How can I, when th meer iedeea of U, marryd and setld, is so
irezistibly funy that I can't keep soeber!" anserd Jo, smieling all
oever her faess, so infectiously that thae had anuther laf, and then
setld doun for a guud tauk, qiet in th plezant oeld fashon.</p>

<p>"It's no uez yuur going out in th coeld to get Amy, for thae ar
all cuming up prezently. I couldn't waet; I wontedw to be th wun to
tel U th grand serpriez, and hav 'furst skim,' as we uezd to sae
when we sqobld about th creem."</p>

<p>"Of corss U did, and spoilt yuur story by begining at th
rong end. Now, start riet, and tel me how it all happened; I'm
piening to noe."</p>

<p>"Wel, I did it to pleez Amy," began Laurie, with a twinkle that
maed Jo exclaem,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">529</span>
"Fib number wun; Amy did it to pleez U. Go on, and tel th
trooth, if U can, sur."</p>

<p>"Now she's begining to marm it; isn't it joly to heer her?" sed
Laurie to th fier, and th fier gloed and sparkld as if it qiet
agreed. "It's all th saem, U noe, she and I being wun. We
pland to cum hoem with th Carrols, a munth or mor ago,
but thae sudenly chaenjd thaer miends, and desieded to pas anuther
winter in Paris. But grandpa wontedw to cum hoem; he went
to pleez me, and I couldn't let him go aloen, neether cuud I leev
Amy; and Mrs. Carrol had got English noeshons about shaperoens and
such nonsenss, and wouldn't let Amy cum with us. So I just setld th
dificulty by saeing, 'Let's be marryd, and then we can do as we liek.'"</p>

<p>"Of corss U did; U aulwaes hav things to suit U."</p>

<p>"Not aulwaes;" and sumthing in Laurie's vois maed Jo sae
haestily,—</p>

<p>"How did U ever get ant to agree?"</p>

<p>"It wuz hard wurk; but, between us, we taukt her oever, for we
had heeps of guud reezons on our sied. Thaer wasn't tiem to riet
and ask leev, but U all liked it, had consented to it by and by, and
it wuz oenly 'taeking Tiem by th fetlock,' as mi wief sez."</p>

<p>"Aren't we proud of thoes too wurds, and don't we liek to sae
them?" interupted Jo, adresing th fier in her turn, and woching
with deliet th hapy liet it seemd to kindl in th ies that had
been so trajikaly gloomy when she saw them last.</p>

<p>"A trifle, perhaps; she's such a captivaeting litl wuuman I can't
help being proud of her. Wel, then, unkl and ant wer thaer to
plae propriety; we wer so absorbd in wun anuther we wer of no
mortal uez apart, and that charming araenjment wuud maek everything
eezy all round; so we did it."</p>

<p>"When, whaer, how?" askt Jo, in a feever of feminine interest
and cueriosity, for she cuud not reealiez it a partikl.</p>

<p>"Six weeks ago, at th American consul's, in Paris; a verry qieet
weding, of corss, for eeven in our hapynes we didn't forget deer
litl Beth."</p>

<p>Jo put her hand in his as he sed that, and Laurie jently smoothd
th litl red pilo, which he rememberd wel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">530</span>
"Whi didn't U let us noe afterward?" askt Jo, in a qieeter
toen, when thae had sat qiet still a mienuet.</p>

<p>"We wontedw to serpriez U; we thaut we wer cuming direktly
hoem, at furst; but th deer oeld jentlman, as soon as we wer marryd,
found he couldn't be redy under a munth, at leest, and sent us
off to spend our hunymoon whaerever we liked. Amy had wunss
called Valrosa a reguelar hunymoon hoem, so we went thaer, and
wer as hapy as peepl ar but wunss in thaer lievs. Mi faeth! wasn't
it luv amung th roezes!"</p>

<p>Laurie seemd to forget Jo for a mienuet, and Jo wuz glad of it; for
th fakt that he toeld her thees things so freely and nacheraly ashuurd
her that he had qiet forgiven and forgoten. She tried to draw away
her hand; but, as if he guessed th thaut that prompted th haf-involuntaery
impulss, Laurie held it fast, and sed, with a manly gravity
she had never seen in him befor,—</p>

<p>"Jo, deer, I wont to sae wun thing, and then we'll put it by forever.
As I toeld U in mi leter, when I roet that Amy had been
so kiend to me, I never shal stop luving U; but th luv is aulterd,
and I hav lurnd to see that it is beter as it is. Amy and U
chaenj plaeses in mi hart, that's all. I think it wuz ment to be so,
and wuud hav cum about nacheraly, if I had waeted, as U tried to
maek me; but I never cuud be paeshent, and so I got a hartaek. I
wuz a boy then, hedstrong and vieolent; and it tuuk a hard leson to
sho me mi mistaek. For it <em>wuz</em> wun, Jo, as U sed, and I found
it out, after maeking a fool of mieself. Upon mi wurd, I wuz so
tumbld up in mi miend, at wun tiem, that I didn't noe which I
luvd best, U or Amy, and tried to luv boeth aliek; but I couldn't,
and when I saw her in Switzerland, everything seemd to cleer up all
at wunss. U boeth got into yuur riet plaeses, and I felt shuur that it
wuz wel off with th oeld luv befor it wuz on with th nue; that I
cuud onestly shaer mi hart between sister Jo and wief Amy, and
luv them boeth deerly. Wil U beleev it, and go bak to th hapy
oeld times when we furst knew wun anuther?"</p>

<p>"I'll beleev it, with all mi hart; but, Teddy, we never can be
boy and gurl again: th hapy oeld times can't cum bak, and we
mustn't expect it. We ar man and wuuman now, with soeber wurk
<span class="pagenum2">531</span>
to do, for playtime is oever, and we must giv up froliking. I'm shuur
U feel this; I see th chaenj in U, and U'll fiend it in me. I
shal mis mi boy, but I shal luv th man as much, and admier him
mor, because he means to be whut I hoept he wuud. We can't be
litl playmates any longer, but we wil be bruther and sister, to luv
and help wun anuther all our lievs, wun't we, Laurie?"</p>

<p>He did not sae a wurd, but tuuk th hand she oferd him, and laed
his faess doun on it for a mienuet, feeling that out of th graev of a
boyish pashon, thaer had rizen a buetiful, strong frendship to bles
them boeth. Prezently Jo sed cheerfuly, for she didn't wont th
cuming hoem to be a sad wun,—</p>

<p>"I can't maek it troo that U children ar reealy marryd, and
going to set up houskeeping. Whi, it seems oenly yesterdae that I
wuz butoning Amy's pinafore, and puuling yuur haer when U teezd.
Mursy me, how tiem duz fli!"</p>

<p>"As wun of th children is oelder than yuurself, U needn't tauk so
liek a grandmaa. I flater mieself I'm a 'jentlman growed,' as Peggotty
sed of David; and when U see Amy, U'll fiend her rather a
precoeshus infant," sed Laurie, luuking amuezd at her maturnal aer.</p>

<p>"U mae be a litl oelder in yeers, but I'm ever so much oelder in
feeling, Teddy. Wimen aulwaes ar; and this last yeer has been such
a hard wun that I feel forty."</p>

<p>"Puur Jo! we left U to baer it aloen, whiel we went pleasuring.
U <em>ar</em> oelder; heer's a lien, and thaer's anuther; unles U smiel,
yuur ies luuk sad, and when I tucht th cuushon, just now, I
found a teer on it. U've had a graet deel to baer, and had to baer
it all aloen. Whut a selfish beest I've been!" and Laurie puuld his
oen haer, with a remorsful luuk.</p>

<p>But Jo oenly turnd oever th traitorous pilo, and anserd, in a
toen which she tried to maek qiet cheerful,—</p>

<p>"No, I had faather and muther to help me, th deer baebys to cumfort
me, and th thaut that U and Amy wer saef and hapy, to
maek th trubls heer eezyer to baer. I <em>am</em> loenly, sumtiems, but I
daer sae it's guud for me, and—"</p>

<p>"U never shal be again," broek in Laurie, putting his arm about
her, as if to fenss out every hueman il. "Amy and I can't get on
<span class="pagenum2">532</span>
without U, so U must cum and teech 'th children' to keep
hous, and go havs in everything, just as we uezd to do, and let us
pet U, and all be blissfully hapy and frendly together."</p>

<p>"If I shouldn't be in th wae, it wuud be verry plezant. I begin
to feel qiet yung aulredy; for, sumhow, all mi trubls seemd to
fli away when U caem. U aulwaes wer a cumfort, Teddy;" and
Jo leend her hed on his shoulder, just as she did yeers ago, when
Beth lae il, and Laurie toeld her to hoeld on to him.</p>

<p>He luukt doun at her, wundering if she rememberd th tiem,
but Jo wuz smieling to herself, as if, in trooth, her trubls 
<em>had</em> all vanisht
at his cuming.</p>

<p>"U ar th saem Jo still, droping teers about wun mienuet,
and lafing th next. U luuk a litl wiked now; whut is it,
grandmaa?"</p>

<p>"I wuz wundering how U and Amy get on together."</p>

<p>"Liek aenjels!"</p>

<p>"Yes, of corss, at furst; but which rools?"</p>

<p>"I don't miend teling U that she duz, now; at leest I let her
think so,—it pleezes her, U noe. By and by we shal taek turns,
for marrej, thae sae, havs wun's riets and doubles wun's duties."</p>

<p>"U'll go on as U begin, and Amy wil rool U all th daes of
yuur lief."</p>

<p>"Wel, she duz it so imperseptibly that I don't think I shal miend
much. She is th sort of wuuman hoo noes how to rool wel; in
fakt, I rather liek it, for she wiends wun round her fingger as softly and
pritily as a skein of silk, and maeks U feel as if she wuz dooing U
a faevor all th whiel."</p>

<p>"That ever I should liv to see U a henpekt huzband and enjoying
it!" cried Jo, with uplifted hands.</p>

<p>It wuz guud to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smiel with
mascuelin scorn at that insinueaeshon, as he replied, with his "hie and
miety" aer,—</p>

<p>"Amy is too wel-bred for that, and I am not th sort of man to
submit to it. Mi wief and I respekt ourselvs and wun anuther too
much ever to tyrannize or qorrel."</p>

<p>Jo liked that, and thaut th nue dignity verry becuming, but th
<span class="pagenum2">533</span>
boy seemd chaenjing verry fast into th man, and regret minggld with
her plezher.</p>

<p>"I am shuur of that; Amy and U never did qorrel as we uezd to.
She is th sun and I th wiend, in th faebl, and th sun manejd th
man best, U remember."</p>

<p>"She can blo him up as wel as shien on him," laft Laurie.
"Such a lecture as I got at Niess! I giv U mi wurd it wuz a deel
wurss than any of yuur scoldings,—a reguelar rouser. I'll tel U all
about it sumtiem,—<em>she</em> never wil, because, after teling me that she
despiezd and wuz ashamed of me, she lost her hart to th despikabl
party and marryd th guud-for-nuthing."</p>

<p>"Whut baseness! Wel, if she abuezes U, cum to me, and I'll
defend U."</p>

<p>"I luuk as if I needed it, don't I?" sed Laurie, geting up and
strieking an atitued which sudenly chaenjd from th impoezing to th
rapcherus, as Amy's vois wuz hurd calling,—</p>

<p>"Whaer is she? Whaer's mi deer oeld Jo?"</p>

<p>In troopt th hoel family, and every wun wuz hugd and kist
all oever again, and, after several vaen atempts, th three waanderers
wer set doun to be luukt at and exulted oever. Mr. Laurence, hael
and harty as ever, wuz qiet as much improovd as th others by his
forin tour, for th crustiness seemd to be neerly gon, and th oeld-fashond
courtliness had reseevd a polish which maed it kindlier than
ever. It wuz guud to see him beem at "mi children," as he called
th yung paer; it wuz beter still to see Amy pae him th daughterly
duty and affection which completely wun his oeld hart; and best of
all, to woch Laurie revolv about th too, as if never tierd of enjoying
th prity pikcher thae maed.</p>

<p>Th mienuet she put her ies upon Amy, Meg becaem conshus that
her oen dres hadn't a Parisian aer, that yung Mrs. Moffat wuud be
entierly eclipst by yung Mrs. Laurence, and that "her ladyship"
wuz aultogether a moest elegant and graesful wuuman. Jo thaut, as
she wocht th paer, "How wel thae luuk together! I wuz riet,
and Laurie has found th buetiful, accomplished gurl hoo wil becum
his hoem beter than clumzy oeld Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to
him." Mrs. March and her huzband smield and noded at eech
<span class="pagenum2">534</span>
uther with hapy faeses, for thae saw that thaer yunggest had dun wel,
not oenly in wurldly things, but th beter welth of luv, confidenss,
and hapynes.</p>

<p>For Amy's faess wuz fuul of th soft brietnes which betokens a
peaceful hart, her vois had a nue tenderness in it, and th cool,
prim carrej wuz chaenjd to a jentl dignity, boeth wuumanly and wining.
No litl affectations mard it, and th corjal sweetness of
her maner wuz mor charming than th nue buety or th oeld graess,
for it stampt her at wunss with th unmistaekably sien of th troo jentlwuuman
she had hoept to becum.</p>

<p>"Luv has dun much for our litl gurl," sed her muther softly.</p>

<p>"She has had a guud exampl befor her all her lief, mi deer,"
Mr. March whisperd bak, with a luving luuk at th worn faess and
grae hed besied him.</p>

<p>Daezy found it imposibl to keep her ies off her "pitty aunty,"
but attached herself liek a lap-dog to th wunderful châtelaine 
fuul of delietful charms. Demi paused to consider th nue relaeshonship
<span class="pagenum2">535</span>
befor he compromiezd himself by th rash acceptance of a bribe,
which tuuk th tempting form of a family of wuuden baers from
Berne. A flank moovment produced an uncondishonal serender,
however, for Laurie knew whaer to hav him.</p>

<p>"Yung man, when I furst had th onor of maeking yuur aqaentanss
U hit me in th faess: now I demand th satisfakshon of a jentlman;"
and with that th taul unkl proceeded to tos and tousle th
small nefue in a wae that damejd his philosophical dignity as much
as it delieted his boyish soel.</p>

<p>"Blest if she ain't in silk from hed to fuut? Ain't it a relishin' siet
to see her settin' thaer as fien as a fidl, and heer foeks calling litl
Amy, Mis. Laurence?" muterd oeld Hannah, hoo cuud not rezist
freeqent "peeks" thru th slied as she set th taebl in a moest
decidedly promiscuous maner.</p>

<p>Mursy on us, how thae did tauk! furst wun, then th uther, then all
burst out together, trieing to tel th history of three yeers in haf an
our. It wuz forchunat that tee wuz at hand, to produce a lul and
provide refreshment, for thae wuud hav been horss and faent if
thae had gon on much longer. Such a hapy procession as field
away into th litl diening-room! Mr. March proudly escorted "Mrs.
Laurence;" Mrs. March as proudly leend on th arm of "mi sun;"
th oeld jentlman tuuk Jo, with a whisperd "U must be mi gurl
now," and a glanss at th empty corner by th fier, that maed Jo
whisper bak, with trembling lips, "I'll tri to fil her plaess, sur."</p>

<p>Th twins pranst behind, feeling that th milenium wuz at hand,
for every wun wuz so busy with th nue-comers that thae wer left to
revel at thaer oen sweet wil, and U mae be shuur thae maed th moest
of th oportuenity. Didn't thae steal sips of tee, stuf jinjerbred
<i>ab libitum</i>, get a hot biskit apeess, and, as a crouning trespass, didn't
thae eech whisk a captivaeting litl tart into thaer tieny pokets, thaer to
stik and crumbl treacherously, teeching them that boeth hueman
naechuur and paestry ar frael? Burdend with th guilty conshusnes
of th seqesterd tarts, and feering that Doedo's sharp ies wuud
peerss th thin disgiez of cambric and merino which hid thaer booty,
th litl sinners attached themselvs to "Dranpa," hoo hadn't his
spektakls on. Amy, hoo wuz handed about liek refreshments, returnd
<span class="pagenum2">536</span>
to th parlor on Faather Laurence's arm; th others paerd off
as befor, and this araenjment left Jo companionless. She did not
miend it at th mienuet, for she linggerd to anser Hannah's eeger inqiery,—</p>

<p>"Wil Mis Amy ried in her coop (<i>coupé</i>), and uez all them 
luvly silver dishes that's stord away oever yander?"</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wunder if she droev six whiet horses, aet off goeld plaet,
and wor diemonds and pointer-laess every dae. Teddy thinks nuthing
too guud for her," returnd Jo with infinit satisfakshon.</p>

<p>"No mor thaer is! Wil U hav hash or fish-bauls for brekfast?"
askt Hannah, hoo wiezly minggld poetry and proez.</p>

<p>"I don't caer;" and Jo shut th dor, feeling that food wuz an uncongenial
topik just then. She stuud a mienuet luuking at th party vanishing
abuv, and, as Demi's short plad legs toild up th last staer, a
suden senss of loenlynes caem oever her so strongly that she luukt
about her with dim ies, as if to fiend sumthing to leen upon, for eeven
Teddy had dezurted her. If she had noen whut burthdae gift wuz
cuming every mienuet neerer and neerer, she wuud not hav sed to
herself, "I'll weep a litl weep when I go to bed; it wun't do to be
dizmal now." Then she droo her hand oever her ies,—for wun of her
boyish habits wuz never to noe whaer her hankerchif wuz,—and
had just manejd to call up a smiel when thaer caem a nok at
th porch-dor.</p>

<p>She oepend it with hospitabl haest, and started as if anuther goest
had cum to serpriez her; for thaer stuud a taul, bearded jentlman,
beeming on her from th darknes liek a midniet sun.</p>

<p>"O Mr. Bhaer, I <em>am</em> so glad to see U!" cried Jo, with a clutch,
as if she feerd th niet wuud swallow him up befor she cuud get
him in.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="b184.png" id="b184.png"></a>

</div>

<p>"And I to see Mis Marsch,—but no, U haf a party—" and
th Professor paused as th sound of voises and th tap of dansing
feet caem doun to them.</p>

<p>"No, we haeven't, oenly th family. Mi sister and frends hav
just cum hoem, and we ar all verry hapy. Cum in, and maek
wun of us."</p>

<p>Tho a verry soeshal man, I think Mr. Bhaer wuud hav gon
<span class="pagenum2">537</span>
decorusly away, and cum again anuther dae; but how cuud he,
when Jo shut th dor behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps
her faess had sumthing to do with it, for she forgot to hied her
joy at seeing him, and shoed it with a franknes that proovd irezistibl
to th solitaery man, hoos welcum far exseeded his boeldest
hoeps.</p>

<p>"If I shal not be Monsieur de Trop, I wil so gladly see them all.
U haf been il, mi frend?"</p>

<p>He put th qeschon abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coet, th liet
fel on her faess, and he saw a chaenj in it.</p>

<p>"Not il, but tierd and sorroeful. We hav had trubl sinss I saw
U last."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I noe. Mi hart wuz sor for U when I hurd that;"
<span class="pagenum2">538</span>
and he shuuk hands again, with such a simpathetik faess that Jo felt as
if no cumfort cuud equal th luuk of th kiend ies, th grasp of th
big, worm hand.</p>

<p>"Faather, muther, this is mi frend, Professor Bhaer," she sed, with
a faess and toen of such irepresibl pride and plezher that she
miet as wel hav bloen a trumpet and oepend th dor with a
flurish.</p>

<p>If th straenjer had had any doubts about his resepshon, thae wer
set at rest in a mienuet by th corjal welcum he reseevd. Every
wun greeted him kiendly, for Jo's saek at furst, but verry soon thae
liked him for his oen. Thae cuud not help it, for he carried th
talisman that oepens all harts, and thees simpl peepl wormd to him
at wunss, feeling eeven th mor frendly because he wuz puur; for poverty
enriches thoes hoo liv abuv it, and is a shuur passport to truly
hospitabl spirits. Mr. Bhaer sat luuking about him with th aer of a
traveller hoo noks at a straenj dor, and, when it oepens, fiends himself
at hoem. Th children went to him liek bees to a huny-pot;
and, establishing themselvs on eech nee, proceeded to captivaet him
by riefling his pokets, puuling his beard, and investigaeting his woch,
with jooveniel audasity. Th wimen telegraft thaer aprooval to
wun anuther, and Mr. March, feeling that he had got a kindred spirit,
oepend his choisest stors for his guessed's benefit, whiel silent John
lisend and enjoyd th tauk, but sed not a wurd, and Mr. Laurence
found it imposibl to go to sleep.</p>

<p>If Jo had not been utherwiez engaejd, Laurie's behaevyor wuud
hav amuezd her; for a faent twinge, not of jelusy, but sumthing
liek suspishon, cauzd that jentlman to stand aloof at furst, and
obzurv th nue-comer with brutherly surcumspekshon. But it did not
last long. He got interested in spiet of himself, and, befor he knew
it, wuz drawn into th surkl; for Mr. Bhaer taukt wel in this jeenial
atmosphere, and did himself justis. He seldom spoek to Laurie,
but he luukt at him ofen, and a shado wuud pas acros his faess, as
if regreting his oen lost yooth, as he wocht th yung man in his
priem. Then his ie wuud turn to Jo so wistfuly that she wuud
hav surely anserd th muet inqiery if she had seen it; but Jo had
her oen ies to taek caer of, and, feeling that thae cuud not be
<span class="pagenum2">539</span>
trusted, she proodently kept them on th litl sok she wuz niting,
liek a model maeden ant.</p>

<p>A stelthy glanss now and then refresht her liek sips of fresh
wauter after a dusty wauk, for th sidelong peeps shoed her several
propitious oemens. Mr. Bhaer's faess had lost th absent-miended
expreshon, and luukt all aliev with interest in th prezent moement,
akchualy yung and handsum, she thaut, forgeting to compaer him
with Laurie, as she uezhualy did straenj men, to thaer graet detriment.
Then he seemd qiet inspired, tho th berryal customs of th
ancients, to which th conversation had straed, miet not be considerd
an exhilarating topik. Jo qiet gloed with trieumf when Teddy
got qencht in an arguement, and thaut to herself, as she wocht
her faather's absorbd faess, "How he wuud enjoy having such a man
as mi Professor to tauk with every dae!" Lastly, Mr. Bhaer wuz
drest in a nue suit of blak, which maed him luuk mor liek a jentlman
than ever. His bushy haer had been cut and smoothly brushed,
but didn't stae in order long, for, in exsieting moements, he rumpld it
up in th droel wae he uezd to do; and Jo liked it rampantly erekt
beter than flat, because she thaut it gaev his fien forhed a Jove-liek
aspekt. Puur Jo, how she did glorifi that plaen man, as she sat
niting away so qieetly, yet leting nuthing escaep her, not eeven th
fakt that Mr. Bhaer akchualy had goeld sleeve-butons in his imacuelet
ristbands!</p>

<p>"Deer oeld felo! He couldn't hav got himself up with mor
caer if he'd been going a-wooing," sed Jo to herself; and then a
suden thaut, born of th wurds, maed her blush so dredfuly that
she had to drop her baul, and go doun after it to hied her faess.</p>

<p>Th manœuvre did not succeed as wel as she expected, however;
for, tho just in th akt of setting fier to a fueneral-piel, th Professor
dropt his torch, metaforikaly speeking, and maed a dive
after th litl bloo baul. Of corss thae bumpt thaer heds smartly
together, saw stars, and boeth caem up flusht and lafing, without
th baul, to rezoom thaer seets, wishing thae had not left them.</p>

<p>Noebody knew whaer th evening went to; for Hannah skilfully
abstrakted th baebys at an eerly our, noding liek too roezy pops,
and Mr. Laurence went hoem to rest. Th others sat round th fier,
<span class="pagenum2">540</span>
tauking away, utterly regardles of th laps of tiem, till Meg, hoos
maturnal miend wuz imprest with a furm convikshon that Daezy had
tumbld out of bed, and Demi set his niet-goun afire studying th
strukcher of maches, maed a moov to go.</p>

<p>"We must hav our sing, in th guud oeld wae, for we ar all together
again wunss mor," sed Jo, feeling that a guud shout wuud be
a saef and plezant vent for th joobilant emotions of her soel.</p>

<p>Thae wer not <em>all</em> thaer. But no wun found th wurds thautles
or untroo; for Beth still seemd amung them, a peaceful presence,
invizibl, but deerer than ever, sinss deth cuud not braek th hous-hoeld
leeg that luv maed indisoluebl. Th litl chaer stuud in its
oeld plaess; th tidy basket, with th bit of wurk she left unfinisht when
th needl groo "so hevy," wuz still on its accustomed shelf; th
beluved instrument, seldom tucht now, had not been moovd; and
abuv it Beth's faess, sereen and smieling, as in th eerly daes, luukt
doun upon them, seeming to sae, "Be hapy. I am heer."</p>

<p>"Plae sumthing, Amy. Let them heer how much U hav improovd,"
sed Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.</p>

<p>But Amy whisperd, with fuul ies, as she twirled th faeded stool,—</p>

<p>"Not to-niet, deer. I can't sho off to-niet."</p>

<p>But she did sho sumthing beter than brilliancy or skil; for she
sung Beth's songs with a tender muezik in her vois which th best
master cuud not hav taut, and tucht th liseners' harts with a
sweeter power than any uther inspiraeshon cuud hav given her. Th
room wuz verry still, when th cleer vois faeld sudenly at th last
lien of Beth's faevorit him. It wuz hard to sae,—</p>

<p class="center">"Urth hath no sorro that heven cannot heel;"</p>

<p class="noindent">
and Amy leend against her huzband, hoo stuud behind her, feeling
that her welcum hoem wuz not qiet perfect without Beth's kis.</p>

<p>"Now, we must finish with Minyon's song; for Mr. Bhaer sings
that," sed Jo, befor th pause groo paenful. And Mr. Bhaer cleerd
his throet with a gratified "Hem!" as he stept into th corner
whaer Jo stuud, saeing,—</p>

<p>"U wil sing with me? We go exselently wel together."</p>

<p>A pleezing fikshon, by th wae; for Jo had no mor iedeea of muezik
<span class="pagenum2">541</span>
than a gras-hoper. But she wuud hav consented if he had propoezd
to sing a hoel opera, and worbld away, blissfully regardles of
tiem and tuen. It didn't much mater; for Mr. Bhaer sang liek a
troo German, hartily and wel; and Jo soon subsided into a subdued
hum, that she miet lisen
to th melo vois
that seemd to sing for
her aloen.</p>

<p class="noindent">and wun lisener wuz so

that she longed

<p>Th song wuz considerd a graet success, and th singer retierd
cuverd with lorels. But a fue minits afterward, he forgot his maners
entierly, and staerd at Amy putting on her bonnet; for she had
been introduest simply as "mi sister," and no wun had called her by
her nue naem sinss he caem. He forgot himself still further when
Laurie sed, in his moest graeshus maner, at parting,—</p>

<p>"Mi wief and I ar verry glad to meet U, sur. Pleez remember
that thaer is aulwaes a welcum waeting for U oever th wae."</p>

<p>"I too shal go; but I shal gladly cum again, if U wil gif me

<p>He spoek to Mrs. March, but he luukt at Jo; and th muther's

March wuz not so bliend to her children's interest as Mrs. Moffat
supoezd.</p>

<p>"I suspekt that is a wiez man," remarkt Mr. March, with plasid

<p>She wunderd whut th business wuz that brought Mr. Bhaer to th

Madam Muther, cuud U lend me mi wief for haf an

in th next dae to fiend Mrs. Laurence sitting in her muther's lap, as

<p>"Surtenly. Go, deer; I forget that U hav any hoem but this,"
and Mrs. March prest th whiet hand that wor th weding-ring,

<p>"Wethercok can without wiend," sugjested Jo, as he paused for a

<p><span class="pagenum2">544</span>
"Exaktly; for Amy keeps me pointing due west moest of th tiem,
with oenly an ocaezhonal whiffle round to th south, and I haeven't had

<p>"We hav our plans; we don't meen to sae much about them yet,
because we ar such verry nue brooms, but we don't intend to be iedl.
I'm going into business with a devoeshon that shal deliet grandfaather,
and proov to him that I'm not spoilt. I need sumthing of

<p>"And Amy, whut is she going to do?" askt Mrs. March, wel
pleezd at Laurie's desizhon, and th enerjy with which he spoek.</p>

<p>"After dooing th sivil all round, and aering our best bonnet, we
shal astonish U by th elegant hospitalitys of our manshon, th
brilliant soesieety we shal draw about us, and th benefishal inflooenss
we shal exert oever th wurld at larj. That's about it, isn't it,
Madame Récamier?" askt Laurie, with a qizikal luuk at Amy.</p>

<p>"Tiem wil sho. Cum away, Impurtinenss, and don't shok mi

that thaer should be a hoem with a guud wief in it befor she
set up a <i>salon</i> as a qeen of soesieety.</p>

<p>"How hapy thoes children seem together!" obzurvd Mr. March,
fiending it dificult to becum absorbd in his Aristotle after th yung

<p>"Yes, and I think it wil last," aded Mrs. March, with th restful

<p>"I noe it wil. Hapy Amy!" and Jo sighed, then smield

<p><span class="pagenum2">545</span>
Laeter in th evening, when his miend had been set at rest about th

<p>"That man intends to marry our Jo!"</p>

<p>"I hoep so; don't U, deer?"</p>

<p>"Wel, mi luv, I consider him a trump, in th fuulest senss of that
expresiv wurd, but I do wish he wuz a litl yungger and a guud
deel richer."</p>

<p>"Now, Laurie, don't be too fastidius and wurldly-miended. If thae
luv wun anuther it doesn't mater a partikl how oeld thae ar nor
how puur. Wimen <em>never</em> should marry for muny—" Amy caut
herself up short as th wurds escaept her, and luukt at her huzband,
hoo replied, with malishus gravity,—</p>

<p>"Surtenly not, tho U do heer charming gurls sae that thae
intend to do it sumtiems. If mi memory survs me, U wunss
thaut it yuur duty to maek a rich mach; that accounts, perhaps,
for yuur marrying a guud-for-nuthing liek me."</p>

<p>"O mi deerest boy, don't, don't sae that! I forgot U wer
rich when I sed 'Yes.' I'd hav marryd U if U hadn't a peny,
and I sumtiems wish U <em>wer</em> puur that I miet sho how
much I luv U;" and Amy, hoo wuz verry dignified in public and
verry fond in private, gaev convincing proofs of th trooth of her
wurds.</p>

<p>"U don't reealy think I am such a mursenaery creecher as I tried
to be wunss, do U? It wuud braek mi hart if U didn't beleev
that I'd gladly puul in th saem boet with U, eeven if U had to get
yuur living by roeing on th laek."</p>

<p>"Am I an idiot and a broot? How cuud I think so, when U
refuezd a richer man for me, and wun't let me giv U haf I wont to
now, when I hav th riet? Gurls do it every dae, puur things, and
ar taut to think it is thaer oenly salvaeshon; but U had beter lesons,
and, tho I trembld for U at wun tiem, I wuz not disapointed,
for th dauter wuz troo to th muther's teeching. I toeld maama so
yesterdae, and she luukt as glad and graetful as if I'd given her a
<span class="pagenum2">546</span>
chek for a milyon, to be spent in charrity. U ar not lisening to
mi moral remarks, Mrs. Laurence;" and Laurie paused, for Amy's
ies had an absent luuk, tho fixed upon his faess.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am, and admiering th dimpl in yuur chin at th saem
tiem. I don't wish to maek U vaen, but I must confes that I'm
prouder of mi handsum huzband than of all his muny. Don't
laf, but yuur noez is <em>such</em> a cumfort to me;" and Amy softly caressed
th wel-cut feechuur with artistik satisfakshon.</p>

<p>Laurie had reseevd meny compliments in his lief, but never wun
that suited him beter, as he plainly shoed, tho he did laf at
his wief's peculiar taest, whiel she sed sloely,—</p>

<p>"Mae I ask U a qeschon, deer?"</p>

<p>"Of corss U mae."</p>

<p>"Shal U caer if Jo duz marry Mr. Bhaer?"</p>

<p>"O, that's th trubl, is it? I thaut thaer wuz sumthing in
th dimpl that didn't suit U. Not being a dog in th maenjer,
but th hapyest felo aliev, I ashuur U I can danss at Jo's
weding with a hart as liet as mi heels. Do U dout it, mi
darling?"</p>

<p>Amy luukt up at him, and wuz satisfied; her last litl jelus feer
vanisht forever, and she thankt him, with a faess fuul of luv and
confidenss.</p>

<p>"I wish we cuud do sumthing for that capital oeld Professor.
Couldn't we invent a rich relaeshon, hoo shal obliejingly die out thaer
in Germany, and leev him a tidy litl forchun?" sed Laurie, when
thae began to paess up and doun th long drawing-room, arm-in-arm,
as thae wer fond of dooing, in memory of th chateau garden.</p>

<p>"Jo wuud fiend us out, and spoil it all; she is verry proud of him,
just as he is, and sed yesterdae that she thaut poverty wuz a buetiful
thing."</p>

<p>"Bles her deer hart! she wun't think so when she has a literaery
huzband, and a duzen litl professors and professorins to suport.
We wun't interfeer now, but woch our chanss, and do them a guud
turn in spiet of themselvs. I oe Jo for a part of mi ejucaeshon, and
she beleevs in peepl's paying thaer onest dets, so I'll get round
her in that wae."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">547</span>
"How delietful it is to be aebl to help others, isn't it? That wuz
aulwaes wun of mi dreems, to hav th power of giving freely; and,
thanks to U, th dreem has cum troo."</p>

<p>"Ah! we'll do qontitys of guud, wun't we? Thaer's wun sort of
poverty that I particularly liek to help. Out-and-out begars get
taeken caer of, but puur gentlefolks faer badly, because thae wun't ask,
and peepl don't daer to ofer charrity; yet thaer ar a thouzand waes
of helping them, if wun oenly noes how to do it so delicatly that it
duz not ofend. I must sae, I liek to surv a decaed jentlman
beter than a blarneying begar; I supoez it's rong, but I do,
tho it is harder."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">548</span>
"Because it taeks a jentlman to do it," aded th uther member
of th domestik admeraeshon soesieety.</p>

<p>"Thank U, I'm afraed I don't dezurv that prity compliment.
But I wuz going to sae that whiel I wuz daudling about abraud, I
saw a guud meny talented yung feloes maeking all sorts of sacrifieses,
and enduuring reeal hardships, that thae miet reealiez thaer dreems.
Splendid feloes, sum of them, wurking liek heroes, puur and frendles,
but so fuul of curej, paeshenss, and ambishon, that I wuz ashamed
of mieself, and longed to giv them a riet guud lift. Thoes ar peepl
hoom it's a satisfakshon to help, for if thae've got jeenyus, it's an
onor to be alowd to surv them, and not let it be lost or delaed
for wont of fueel to keep th pot boiling; if thae haeven't, it's a plezher
to cumfort th puur soels, and keep them from despaer when
thae fiend it out."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; and thaer's anuther clas hoo can't ask, and hoo
sufer in silence. I noe sumthing of it, for I belongd to it befor
U maed a prinsess of me, as th king duz th begar-maed in th
oeld story. Ambishus gurls hav a hard tiem, Laurie, and ofen hav
to see yooth, helth, and precious oportuenitys go by, just for wont
of a litl help at th riet mienuet. Peepl hav been verry kiend to
me; and whenever I see gurls strugling along, as we uezd to do, I
wont to put out mi hand and help them, as I wuz helpt."</p>

<p>"And so U shal, liek an aenjel as U ar!" cried Laurie, rezolving,
with a glo of philanthropic zeel, to found and endow an institooshon
for th expres benefit of yung wimen with artistik tendensys.
"Rich peepl hav no riet to sit doun and enjoy themselvs, or let
thaer muny acuemulaet for others to waest. It's not haf so sensibl
to leev legasys when wun dies as it is to uez th muny wiezly whiel
aliev, and enjoy maeking wun's felo-creechers hapy with it. We'll
hav a guud tiem ourselvs, and ad an extra relish to our oen plezher
by giving uther peepl a jenerus taest. Wil U be a litl
Dorcas, going about emptying a big basket of cumforts, and filing it
up with guud deeds?"</p>

<p>"With all mi hart, if U wil be a braev St. Martin, stoping, as
U ried galantly thru th wurld, to shaer yuur cloek with th
begar."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">549</span>
"It's a bargan, and we shal get th best of it!"</p>

<p>So th yung paer shuuk hands upon it, and then paest hapily on
again, feeling that thaer plezant hoem wuz mor hoem-liek because
thae hoept to brieten uther hoems, beleeving that thaer oen feet
wuud wauk mor uprightly along th flowery path befor them, if thae
smoothd ruf waes for uther feet, and feeling that thaer harts wer

<p><span class="smc">I cannot</span> feel that I hav dun mi duty as humbl historian of th
March family, without devoeting at leest wun chapter to th too moest
precious and important members of it. Daezy and Demi had now
arrived at yeers of discreshon; for in this fast aej baebys of three or
foer assert thaer riets, and get them, too, which is mor than meny
of thaer elders do. If thaer ever wer a paer of twins in daenjer of
being utterly spoilt by adoration, it wuz thees prattling Brookes. Of
corss thae wer th moest remarkabl children ever born, as wil be
shoen when I menshon that thae waukt at aet munths, taukt flooently
at twelve munths, and at too yeers thae tuuk thaer plaeses at
taebl, and behaevd with a propriety which charmd all behoelders.
At three, Daezy demanded a "needler," and akchualy maed a bag with
foer stitches in it; she liekwiez set up houskeeping in th sideboard,
and manejd a miecroskopik cuuking-stoev with a skil that brought
teers of pride to Hannah's ies, whiel Demi lurnd his leters with
his grandfaather, hoo invented a nue moed of teeching th alfabet
by forming th leters with his arms and legs, thus uenieting gymnastics
for hed and heels. Th boy eerly developt a mecanikal jeenyus
which delieted his faather and distracted his muther, for he tried to
imitaet every masheen he saw, and kept th nursery in a caeotik condishon,
with his "sewin-sheen,"—a misteerius strukcher of string,
chaers, cloeths-pins, and spools, for wheels to go "woond and woond;"
aulso a basket hung oever th bak of a big chaer, in which he vainly
tried to hoist his too confieding sister, hoo, with feminine devoeshon, alowd
her litl hed to be bumpt till rescued, when th yung
inventor indignantly remarkt, "Whi, marmar, dat's mi lellywaiter,
and me's trieing to puul her up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">551</span>
Tho utterly unliek in carrakter, th twins got on remarkably
wel together, and seldom quarrelled mor than thriess a dae. Of
corss, Demi tyrannized oever Daezy, and galantly defended her from
every uther agresor; whiel Daezy maed a galley-slaev of herself, and
adord her bruther as th wun perfect being in th wurld. A roezy,
chuby, sunshiny litl soel wuz Daezy, hoo found her wae to everybody's
hart, and nesld thaer. Wun of th captivaeting children,
hoo seem maed to be kist and cudld, adornd and adord liek
litl godeses, and produced for jeneral aprooval on all festiv ocaezhons.
Her small vurchoos wer so sweet that she wuud hav been
qiet anjelik if a fue small naughtinesses had not kept her delietfuly
hueman. It wuz all faer wether in her wurld, and every morning she
scrambld up to th windo

"O, pitty dae, o, pitty

that th moest inveterat bachelors

<p>"Mi deer, do U think it wiez to tauk about such things to that
baeby? He's geting graet bumps oever his ies, and lurning to ask
th moest unanserabl qeschons."</p>

<p>"If he is oeld enough to ask th qeschons he is oeld enough to
reseev troo ansers. I am not putting th thoughts into his hed,
but helping him unfoeld thoes aulredy thaer. Thees children ar wiezer
than we ar, and I hav no dout th boy understands every wurd
I hav sed to him. Now, Demi, tel me whaer U keep yuur
miend?"</p>

<p>If th boy had replied liek Alcibiades, "By th gods, Socrates, I
cannot tel," his grandfaather wuud not hav been serpriezd; but when,
after standing a moement on wun leg, liek a meditaetiv yung stork,
he anserd, in a toen of calm convikshon, "In mi litl bely," th oeld
jentlman cuud oenly join in grandmaa's laf, and dismis th clas
in metafiziks.</p>

<p>Thaer miet hav been cauz for maturnal anxiety, if Demi had not
given convincing proofs that he wuz a troo boy, as wel as a buding
philosopher; for, ofen, after a discushon which cauzd Hannah to
prophesy, with ominus nods, "That chield ain't long for this wurld,"
he wuud turn about and set her feers at rest by sum of th pranks
with which deer, durty, nauty litl rascals distract and deliet thaer
paerents' soels.</p>

<p>Meg maed meny moral rools, and tried to keep them; but whut
muther wuz ever proof against th wining wiels, th injeenius evaezhons,
<span class="pagenum2">554</span>
or th tranquil audasity of th miniacher men and wimen hoo so eerly
sho themselvs accomplished Artful Dojers?</p>

<p>"No mor raezins, Demi, thae'll maek U sik," sez maama to th
yung purson hoo ofers his survises in th kichen with unfaeling
reguelarrity on plum-puuding dae.</p>

<p>"Me lieks to be sik."</p>

<p>"I don't wont to hav U, so run away and help Daezy maek
patty-cakes."</p>

<p>He reluktantly departs, but his rongs wae upon his spirit; and,
by and by, when an oportuenity cums to redress them, he outwits
maama by a shrewd bargan.</p>

<p>"Now U hav been guud children, and I'll plae anything U
liek," sez Meg, as she leeds her assistant cuuks upstaers, when th
puuding is saefly bounsing in th pot.</p>

<p>"Truly, marmar?" asks Demi, with a brilliant iedeea in his wel-pouderd
hed.</p>

<p>"Yes, truly; anything U sae," replies th short-sieted paerent,
prepaering herself to sing "Th Three Litl Kitens" haf a duzen
times oever, or to taek her family to "Bie a peny bun," regardles of
wiend or lim. But Demi corners her by th cool replie,—</p>

<p>"Then we'll go and eat up all th raezins."</p>

<p>Ant Doedo wuz cheef playmate and <i>confidante</i> of boeth children,
and th trio turnd th litl hous topsy-turvy. Ant Amy wuz as yet
oenly a naem to them, Ant Beth soon faeded into a pleasantly vaeg
memory, but Ant Doedo wuz a living reality, and thae maed th moest
of her, for which compliment she wuz deeply graetful. But when Mr.
Bhaer caem, Jo neglekted her playfellows, and dismae and desolaeshon
fel upon thaer litl soels. Daezy, hoo wuz fond of going about pedling
kises, lost her best customer and becaem bankrupt; Demi, with infantiel
penetraeshon, soon discuverd that Doedo liked to plae with "th
baer-man" beter than she did with him; but, tho hurt, he concealed
his anguish, for he hadn't th hart to insult a rieval hoo kept a
mien of chocolat-drops in his waestcoet-poket, and a woch that cuud
be taeken out of its caess and freely shaeken by ardent admierers.</p>

<p>Sum pursons miet hav considerd thees pleezing libertys as
bribes; but Demi didn't see it in that liet, and continued to patronize
<span class="pagenum2">555</span>
th "baer-man" with pensiv affability, whiel Daezy bestoed her
small affections upon him at th thurd call, and considerd his shoulder
her throen, his arm her refuej, his gifts treasures of surpassing wurth.</p>

<p>Jentlmen ar sumtiems seezd with suden fits of admeraeshon for
th yung relativs of laedys hoom thae onor with thaer regard; but
this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneezily upon them, and duz
not deseev anybody a partikl. Mr. Bhaer's devoeshon wuz sincere,
however liekwiez efektiv,—for onesty is th best polisy in luv as
in law; he wuz wun of th men hoo ar at hoem with children, and
luukt particularly wel when litl faeses maed a plezant contrast
with his manly wun. His business, whotever it wuz, detaend him from
dae to dae, but evening seldom faeld to bring him out to see—wel,
he aulwaes askt for Mr. March, so I supoez <em>he</em> wuz th atrakshon.
Th exselent papa laebord under th deloozhon that he wuz, and reveld
in long discushons with th kindred spirit, till a chanss remark
of his mor obzurving grandson sudenly enlightened him.</p>

<p>Mr. Bhaer caem in wun evening to pause on th threshhoeld of th
study, astonisht by th spektakl that met his ie. Proen upon th
flor lae Mr. March, with his respektabl legs in th aer, and besied
him, liekwiez proen, wuz Demi, trieing to imitaet th atitued with his
oen short, scarlet-stockinged legs, boeth grovellers so seeriusly absorbd
that thae wer unconshus of spektaetors, till Mr. Bhaer laft his
sonorus laf, and Jo cried out, with a scandalized faess,—</p>

<p>"Faather, faather, heer's th Professor!"</p>

<p>Doun went th blak legs and up caem th grae hed, as th preceptor
sed, with undisturbd dignity,—</p>

<p>"Guud evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuez me for a moement; we ar
just finishing our leson. Now, Demi, maek th leter and tel its
naem."</p>

<p>"I noes him!" and, after a fue convulsive eforts, th red legs
tuuk th shaep of a paer of compasses, and th intelijent pupil triumphantly
shouted, "It's a We, dranpa, it's a We!"</p>

<p>"He's a born Weller," laft Jo, as her paerent gatherd himself
up, and her nefue tried to stand on his hed, as th oenly moed of
expresing his satisfakshon that scool wuz oever.</p>

<p>"Whut hav U been at to-dae, bübchen?" askt Mr. Bhaer,
piking up th gymnast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">556</span>
"Me went to see litl Mary."</p>

<p>"And whut did U thaer?"</p>

<p>"I kist her," began Demi, with artles franknes.</p>

<p>"Prut! thow beginnest eerly. Whut did th litl Mary sae to
that?" askt Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confes th yung siner, hoo
stuud upon his nee, exploring th waestcoet-poket.</p>

<p>"O, she liked it, and she kist me, and I liked it. <em>Don't</em> litl
boys liek litl gurls?" aded Demi, with his mouth fuul, and an aer of
bland satisfakshon.</p>

<p>"U precoeshus chik! Hoo put that into yuur hed?" sed Jo,
enjoying th inosent revelaeshons as much as th Professor.</p>

<p>"'Tisn't in mien hed; it's in mien mouf," anserd literal Demi,
putting out his tung, with a chocolat-drop on it, thinking she
alooded to confectionery, not iedeeas.</p>

<p>"Thow shouldst saev sum for th litl frend: sweets to th sweet,
mannling;" and Mr. Bhaer oferd Jo sum, with a luuk that maed
her wunder if chocolat wuz not th nektar drunk by th gods. Demi
aulso saw th smiel, wuz imprest by it, and artlesly inqierd,—</p>

<p>
"Do graet boys liek graet gurls, too, 'Fessor?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">557</span>
Liek yung Washington, Mr. Bhaer "couldn't tel a lie;" so he gaev
th sumwhot vaeg replie that he beleevd thae did sumtiems, in a
toen that maed Mr. March put doun his cloeths-brush, glanss at Jo's
retiering faess, and then sink into his chaer, luuking as if th "precoeshus
chik" had put an iedeea into <em>his</em> hed that wuz boeth sweet and sour.</p>

<p>Whi Doedo, when she caut him in th china-clozet haf an our
afterward, neerly sqeezd th breth out of his litl body with a tender
embrace, insted of shaeking him for being thaer, and whi she foloed

of bred and jely, remaend wun of th problems oever which Demi
puzzled his small wits, and wuz forst to leev unsolvd forever.</p>

<p class="h2a">UNDER Th Umbrela.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Whiel</span> Laurie and Amy wer taeking conjugal stroels oever velvet
carpets, as thae set thaer hous in order, and pland a blissful fuecher,
Mr. Bhaer and Jo wer enjoying promenades of a diferent sort, along
mudy roeds and soden feelds.</p>

<p>"I aulwaes do taek a wauk tord evening, and I don't noe whi I
should giv it up, just because I ofen hapen to meet th Professor
on his wae out," sed Jo to herself, after too or three encounters; for,
tho thaer wer too paths to Meg's, whichever wun she tuuk she wuz
shuur to meet him, eether going or returning. He wuz aulwaes wauking
rapidly, and never seemd to see her till qiet cloez, when he wuud
luuk as if his short-sieted ies had faeld to recogniez th approaching
laedy till that moement. Then, if she wuz going to Meg's, he
aulwaes had sumthing for th baebys; if her faess wuz turnd hoemward,
he had meerly stroeld doun to see th river, and wuz just about
returning, unles thae wer tierd of his freeqent calls.</p>

<p>Under th surcumstanses, whut cuud Jo do but greet him sivily,
and inviet him in? If she <em>wuz</em> tierd of his vizits, she concealed
her weerynes with perfect skil, and tuuk caer that thaer should be
<span class="pagenum2">559</span>
cofy for super, "as Friedrich—I meen Mr. Bhaer—doesn't liek
tee."</p>

<p>By th second week, every wun knew perfectly wel whut wuz going
on, yet every wun tried to luuk as if thae wer stoen-bliend to th
chaenjes in Jo's faess. Thae never askt whi she sang about her wurk,
did up her haer three times a dae, and got so blooming with her evening
exercise; and no wun seemd to hav th slightest suspishon that
Professor Bhaer, whiel tauking philosophy with th faather, wuz giving
th dauter lesons in luv.</p>

<p>Jo couldn't eeven looz her hart in a decorus maner, but sturnly
tried to qench her feelings; and, faeling to do so, led a sumwhot
ajitaeted lief. She wuz mortaly afraed of being laft at for serendering,
after her meny and vee’ement declaeraeshons of independenss.
Laurie wuz her especial dred; but, thanks to th nue manejer, he
behaevd with praiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer "a
capital oeld felo" in public, never alooded, in th remoetest maner,
to Jo's improovd apeeranss, or exprest th leest serpriez at seeing
th Professor's hat on th Marches' haul-taebl neerly every evening.
But he exulted in private and longed for th tiem to cum when
he cuud giv Jo a peess of plaet, with a baer and a raged staf on it
as an aproepriat coet-of-arms.</p>

<p>For a fortniet, th Professor caem and went with luver-liek reguelarrity;
then he staed away for three hoel daes, and maed no sien,—a
proceeding which cauzd everybody to luuk soeber, and Jo to becum
pensiv, at furst, and then—alas for roemanss!—verry cros.</p>

<p>"Disgusted, I daer sae, and gon hoem as sudenly as he caem.
It's nuthing to me, of corss; but I <em>should</em> think he wuud hav
cum and bid us guud-by, liek a jentlman," she sed to herself, with
a despaering luuk at th gaet, as she put on her things for th customaery
wauk, wun dul afternoon.</p>

<p>"U'd beter taek th litl umbrela, deer; it luuks liek raen," sed
her muther, obzurving that she had on her nue bonnet, but not alooding
to th fakt.</p>

<p>"Yes, Marmee; do U wont anything in town? I've got to run
in
and get sum paeper," returnd Jo, puuling out th boe under her chin
befor th glas as an excuez for not luuking at her muther.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">560</span>
"Yes; I wont sum twilled silesia, a paeper of number nien needls,
and too yards of narro lavender ribon. Hav U got yuur thik
boots on, and sumthing worm under yuur cloek?"</p>

<p>"I beleev so," anserd Jo absently.</p>

<p>"If U hapen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him hoem to tee. I
qiet long to see th deer man," aded Mrs. March.</p>

<p>Jo hurd <em>that</em>, but maed no anser, exsept to kis her muther, and
wauk rapidly away, thinking with a glo of gratitood, in spiet of her
hartaek,—</p>

<p>"How guud she is to me! Whut <em>do</em> gurls do hoo haeven't any
muthers to help them thru thaer trubls?"</p>

<p>Th dri-guuds stors wer not doun amung th counting-houses,
banks, and hoelsael waer-rooms, whaer jentlmen moest do congregate;
but Jo found herself in that part of th sity befor she did a
singgl errand, loitering along as if waeting for sum wun, examining
enjineering instruments in wun windo and sampls of wuul in
anuther with moest unfeminine interest; tumbling oever barrels, being
haf-smutherd by desending baels, and husld unseremoeniusly by
busy men hoo luukt as if thae wunderd "how th deuce she got
thaer." A drop of raen on her cheek recauld her thoughts from
baffled hoeps to rooind ribons; for th drops continued to faul, and,
being a wuuman as wel as a luver, she felt that, tho it wuz too laet to
saev her hart, she miet her bonnet. Now she rememberd th litl
umbrela, which she had forgoten to taek in her hurry to be off; but
regret wuz unavaeling, and nuthing cuud be dun but borrow wun or
submit to a drenching. She luukt up at th loeering ski, doun at
th crimson boe aulredy flekt with blak, forward along th mudy
street, then wun long, linggering luuk behind, at a surten grimy waerhous,
with "Hoffmann, Swartz, &amp; Co." oever th dor, and sed to
herself, with a sturnly reproechful aer,—</p>

<p>"It survs me riet! Whut business had I to put on all mi best
things and cum philandering doun heer, hoeping to see th Professor?
Jo, I'm ashamed of U! No, U shal <em>not</em> go thaer to borrow an
umbrela, or fiend out whaer he is, from his frends. U shal
truj
away, and do yuur errands in th raen; and if U cach yuur deth
and rooin yuur bonnet, it's no mor than U dezurv. Now then!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">561</span>
With that she rusht acros th street so impechu’usly that she narroely
escaept anieilaeshon from a pasing truk, and precipitated herself
into th arms of a stately oeld jentlman, hoo sed, "I beg
pardon, maa'am," and luukt mortaly ofended. Sumwhot daunted,
Jo rieted herself, spred her hankerchif oever th devoeted ribons,
and, putting temptaeshon behind her, huryd on, with increesing dampnes
about th ankls, and much clashing of umbrelas oeverhed.
Th fakt that a sumwhot dilapidaeted bloo wun remaend staeshonaery
abuv th unproetekted bonnet, atrakted her atenshon; and, luuking
up, she saw Mr. Bhaer luuking doun.</p>

<p>"I feel to noe th strong-miended laedy hoo goes so bravely under
meny horss-noezes, and so fast thru much mud. Whut do U
doun heer, mi frend?"</p>

<p>"I'm shoping."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">562</span>
Mr. Bhaer smield, as he glanst from th pikl-faktory on wun
sied, to th hoelsael hied and lether concern on th uther; but he
oenly sed polietly,—</p>

<p>"U haf no umbrela. Mae I go aulso, and taek for U th
bundles?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank U."</p>

<p>Jo's cheeks wer as red as her ribon, and she wunderd whut he
thaut of her; but she didn't caer, for in a mienuet she found herself
wauking away arm-in-arm with her Professor, feeling as if th sun had
sudenly burst out with uncomon brilliancy, that th wurld wuz all
riet again, and that wun thuroely hapy wuuman wuz padling
thru th wet that dae.</p>

<p>"We thaut U had gon," sed Jo haestily, for she knew he wuz
luuking at her. Her bonnet wasn't big enough to hied her faess, and
she feerd he miet think th joy it betraed unmaidenly.</p>

<p>"Did U beleev that I should go with no faerwel to thoes hoo
haf been so hevenly kiend to me?" he askt so reproechfuly that
she felt as if she had insulted him by th sugjeschon, and anserd
hartily,—</p>

<p>"No, <em>I</em> didn't; I knew U wer busy about yuur oen affairs, but
we rather mist U,—faather and muther especially."</p>

<p>"And U?"</p>

<p>"I'm aulwaes glad to see U, sur."</p>

<p>In her anxiety to keep her vois qiet calm, Jo maed it rather
cool, and th frosty litl monosilabl at th end seemd to chil th
Professor, for his smiel vanisht, as he sed gravely,—</p>

<p>"I thank U, and cum wun tiem mor befor I go."</p>

<p>"U <em>ar</em> going, then?"</p>

<p>"I haf no longer any business heer; it is dun."</p>

<p>"Successfully, I hoep?" sed Jo, for th bitterness of disapointment
wuz in that short replie of his.</p>

<p>"I aut to think so, for I haf a wae oepend to me by which I
can maek mi bred and gif mi Jünglings much help."</p>

<p>"Tel me, pleez! I liek to noe all about th—th boys," sed
Jo eegerly.</p>

<p>"That is so kiend, I gladly tel U. Mi frends fiend for me a plaess
<span class="pagenum2">563</span>
in a colej, whaer I teech as at hoem, and urn enough to maek th
wae smooth for Franz and Emil. For this I should be graetful, should
I not?"</p>

<p>"Indeed U should. How splendid it wil be to hav U dooing
whut U liek, and be aebl to see U ofen, and th boys!" cried Jo,
clinging to th lads as an excuez for th satisfakshon she cuud not
help betraeing.</p>

<p>"Ah! but we shal not meet ofen, I feer; this plaess is at th
West."</p>

<p>"So far away!" and Jo left her scurts to thaer faet, as if it didn't
mater now whut becaem of her cloeths or herself.</p>

<p>Mr. Bhaer cuud red several langgwejes, but he had not lurnd to
red wimen yet. He flaterd himself that he knew Jo prity wel,
and wuz, thaerfor, much amaezd by th contradictions of vois, faess,
and maner, which she shoed him in rapid succession that dae,
for she wuz in haf a duzen diferent moods in th corss of haf an
our. When she met him she luukt serpriezd, tho it wuz imposibl
to help suspekting that she had cum for that expres purpos.
When he oferd her his arm, she tuuk it with a luuk that fild him
with deliet; but when he askt if she mist him, she gaev such a
chily, formal replie that despaer fel upon him. On lurning his guud
forchun she aulmoest clapt her hands: wuz th joy all for th boys?
Then, on heering his destinaeshon, she sed, "So far away!" in a toen
of despaer that lifted him on to a pinnacle of hoep; but th next
mienuet she tumbld him doun again by obzurving, liek wun entierly
absorbd in th mater,—</p>

<p>"Heer's th plaess for mi errands; wil U cum in? It wun't
taek long."</p>

<p>Jo rather prided herself upon her shoping capabilities, and particularly
wisht to impres her escort with th neetnes and despach
with which she wuud accomplish th business. But, oeing to th
flutter she wuz in, everything went amis; she upset th trae of
needls, forgot th silesia wuz to be "twilled" till it wuz cut off, gaev
th rong chaenj, and cuverd herself with confuezhon by asking for
lavender ribon at th calico counter. Mr. Bhaer stuud by, woching
her blush and blunder; and, as he wocht, his oen bewilderment
<span class="pagenum2">564</span>
seemd to subside, for he wuz begining to see that on sum ocaezhons
wimen, liek dreems, go by contraries.</p>

<p>When thae caem out, he put th parsel under his arm with a mor
cheerful aspekt, and splasht thru th pudls as if he rather
enjoyd it, on th hoel.</p>

<p>"Should we not do a litl whut U call shoping for th baebys,
and haf a faerwel feest to-niet if I go for mi last call at yuur so
plezant hoem?" he askt, stoping befor a windo fuul of froot and
flowers.</p>

<p>"Whut wil we bie?" sed Jo, ignoring th later part of his speech,
and snifing th minggld odors with an affectation of deliet as thae
went in.</p>

<p>"Mae thae haf orenjes and figs?" askt Mr. Bhaer, with a
paturnal aer.</p>

<p>"Thae eat them when thae can get them."</p>

<p>"Do U caer for nuts?"</p>

<p>"Liek a squirrel."</p>

<p>"Hamburg graeps; yes, we shal surely drink to th Faatherland in
thoes?"</p>

<p>Jo fround upon that peess of extravagance, and askt whi he
didn't bie a frael of daets, a cask of raezins, and a bag of aamunds,
and dun with it? Whaerat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purss, produced
his oen, and finisht th marketing by buying several pounds
of graeps, a pot of roezy daezys, and a prity jar of huny, to be regarded
in th liet of a demijon. Then, distorting his pokets with
th noby bundles, and giving her th flowers to hoeld, he put up th
oeld umbrela, and thae travelled on again.</p>

<p>"Mis Marsch, I haf a graet faevor to ask of U," began th Professor,
after a moist promenade of haf a blok.</p>

<p>"Yes, sur;" and Jo's hart began to beet so hard she wuz afraed he
wuud heer it.</p>

<p>"I am boeld to sae it in spiet of th raen, because so short a tiem
remaens to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, sur;" and Jo neerly crusht th small flower-pot with th
suden sqeez she gaev it.</p>

<p>"I wish to get a litl dres for mi Tina, and I am too stoopid to go
aloen. Wil U kiendly gif me a wurd of taest and help?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">565</span>
"Yes, sur;" and Jo felt as calm and cool, all of a suden, as if she
had stept into a refrijeraetor.</p>

<p>"Perhaps aulso a shaul for Tina's muther, she is so puur and sik,
and th huzband is such a caer. Yes, yes, a thik, worm shaul wuud
be a frendly thing to taek th litl muther."</p>

<p>"I'll do it with plezher, Mr. Bhaer. I'm going verry fast and he's
geting deerer every mienuet," aded Jo to herself; then, with a mental
shaek, she entered into th business with an enerjy which wuz plezant
to behoeld.</p>

<p>Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she choez a prity goun for Tina,
and then orderd out th shauls. Th clurk, being a marryd man,
condescended to taek an interest in th cupl, hoo apeerd to be
shoping for thaer family.</p>

<p>"Yuur laedy mae prefur this; it's a superior artikl, a moest dezierabl
culor, qiet chast and jenteel," he sed, shaeking out a comfortable
grae shaul, and throeing it oever Jo's shoulders.</p>

<p>"Exselently wel; we wil haf it," anserd th Professor, smieling
to himself as he paed for it, whiel Jo continued to rumej th counters
liek a confurmd bargan-hunter.</p>

<p>"Now shal we go hoem?" he askt, as if th wurds wer verry
plezant to him.</p>

<p>"Yes; it's laet, and I'm <em>so</em> tierd." Jo's vois wuz mor pathetik
than she knew; for now th sun seemd to hav gon in as sudenly
as it caem out, th wurld groo mudy and mizerabl again, and for
th furst tiem she discuverd that her feet wer coeld, her hed aekt,
and that her hart wuz coelder than th former, fuuler of paen than th
later. Mr. Bhaer wuz going away; he oenly caerd for her as a frend;
it wuz all a mistaek, and th sooner it wuz oever th beter. With this
iedeea in her hed, she haeld an approaching omnibus with such a
hasty jescher that th daezys floo out of th pot and wer badly
damejd.</p>

<p>"This is not our omniboos," sed th Professor, waeving th loeded
veeikl away, and stoping to pik up th puur litl flowers.</p>

<p>"I beg yuur pardon, I didn't see th naem distinctly. Never
miend, I can wauk. I'm uezd to ploding in th mud," returnd Jo,
winking hard, because she wuud hav died rather than oepenly wiep
her ies.</p>

<p>Mr. Bhaer saw th drops on her cheeks, tho she turnd her
hed away; th siet seemd to tuch him verry much, for, sudenly
stooping doun, he askt in a toen that ment a graet deel,—</p>

<p>"Hart's deerest, whi do U cri?"</p>

<p>Now, if Jo had not been nue to this sort of thing she wuud hav
sed she wasn't crieing, had a coeld in her hed, or toeld any uther
feminine fib proper to th ocaezhon; insted of which that undignified
creecher anserd, with an irepresibl sob,—</p>

<p>"Because U ar going away."</p>

<p>"Ach, mein Gott, that is <em>so</em> guud!" cried Mr. Bhaer, manejing to
clasp his hands in spiet of th umbrela and th bundles. "Jo, I haf
nuthing but much luv to gif U; I caem to see if U cuud caer
for it, and I waeted to be shuur that I wuz sumthing mor than a
<span class="pagenum2">567</span>
frend. Am I? Can U maek a litl plaess in yuur hart for oeld
Fritz?" he aded, all in wun breth.</p>

<p>"O, yes!" sed Jo; and he wuz qiet satisfied, for she foelded boeth
hands oever his arm, and luukt up at him with an expreshon that
plainly shoed how hapy she wuud be to wauk thru lief besied
him, eeven tho she had no beter shelter than th oeld umbrela, if
he carried it.</p>

<p>It wuz surtenly propoezing under dificultys, for, eeven if he had
dezierd to do so, Mr. Bhaer cuud not go doun upon his nees, on
account of th mud; neether cuud he ofer Jo his hand, exsept figerativly,
for boeth wer fuul; much les cuud he indulj in tender
demonstraeshons in th oepen street, tho he wuz neer it: so th oenly
wae in which he cuud expres his rapcher wuz to luuk at her, with an
expreshon which glorified his faess to such a degree that thaer akchualy
seemd to be litl raenboes in th drops that sparkld on his beard.
If he had not luvd Jo verry much, I don't think he cuud hav
dun it <em>then</em>, for she luukt far from luvly, with her scurts in a deplorabl
staet, her ruber boots splasht to th ankl, and her bonnet
a rooin. Forchunatly, Mr. Bhaer considerd her th moest buetiful
wuuman living, and she found him mor "Jove-liek" than ever, tho
his hat-brim wuz qiet limp with th litl rills trikling thenss upon
his shoulders (for he held th umbrela all oever Jo), and every fingger
of his gluvs needed mending.</p>

<p>Passers-by probably thaut them a paer of harmles loonatiks, for
thae entierly forgot to hael a 'bus, and stroeld leezherly along, oblivius
of deepening dusk and fog. Litl thae caerd whut anybody
thaut, for thae wer enjoying th hapy our that seldom cums
but wunss in any lief, th majikal moement which bestoes yooth on th
oeld, buety on th plaen, welth on th puur, and givs hueman harts
a foretaste of heven. Th Professor luukt as if he had conkerd
a kingdom, and th wurld had nuthing mor to ofer him in th wae
of bliss; whiel Jo trujd besied him, feeling as if her plaess had aulwaes
been thaer, and wundering how she ever cuud hav choezen any uther
lot. Of corss, she wuz th furst to speek—intelijibly, I meen, for
th emotional remarks which foloed her impechu’us "O, yes!"
wer not of a coherent or reportabl carrakter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">568</span>
"Friedrich, whi didn't U—"</p>

<p>"Ah, heven, she gifs me th naem that no wun speeks sinss Minna
died!" cried th Professor, pausing in a pudl to regard her with
graetful deliet.</p>

<p>"I aulwaes call U so to mieself—I forgot; but I wun't, unles U
liek it."</p>

<p>"Liek it? it is mor sweet to me than I can tel. Sae 'thow,' aulso,
and I shal sae yuur langgwej is aulmoest as buetiful as mien."</p>

<p>"Isn't 'thow' a litl sentimental?" askt Jo, privately thinking it
a luvly monosilabl.</p>

<p>"Sentimental? Yes. Thank Gott, we Germans beleev in sentiment,
and keep ourselvs yung mit it. Yuur English 'U' is so coeld,
sae 'thow,' hart's deerest, it means so much to me," pleeded Mr.
Bhaer, mor liek a roemantik stoodent than a graev professor.</p>

<p>"Wel, then, whi didn't thow tel me all this sooner?" askt Jo
bashfully.</p>

<p>"Now I shal haf to sho thee all mi hart, and I so gladly wil,
because thow must taek caer of it heerafter. See, then, mi Jo,—ah,
th deer, funy litl naem!—I had a wish to tel sumthing th dae
I sed guud-by, in Nue York; but I thaut th handsum frend wuz
betrothed to thee, and so I spoek not. Wouldst thow hav sed
'Yes,' then, if I <em>had</em> spoeken?"</p>

<p>"I don't noe; I'm afraed not, for I didn't hav any hart just
then."</p>

<p>"Prut! that I do not beleev. It wuz asleep till th faery prinss
caem thru th wuud, and waekt it up. Ah, wel, 'Die erste Liebe
ist die beste;' but that I should not expect."</p>

<p>"Yes, th furst luv <em>is</em> th best; so be contented, for I never had
anuther. Teddy wuz oenly a boy, and soon got oever his litl fansy,"
sed Jo, anxious to corekt th Professor's mistaek.</p>

<p>"Guud! then I shal rest hapy, and be shuur that thow givest me
all. I haf waeted so long, I am groen selfish, as thow wilt fiend, Professorin."</p>

<p>"I liek that," cried Jo, delieted with her nue naem. "Now tel
me whut brought U, at last, just when I moest wontedw U?"</p>

<p>"This;" and Mr. Bhaer tuuk a litl worn paeper out of his waestcoet-poket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">569</span>
Jo unfoelded it, and luukt much abasht, for it wuz wun of her oen
contributions to a paeper that paed for poetry, which accounted for
her sending it an ocaezhonal atempt.</p>

<p>"How cuud that bring U?" she askt, wundering whut he ment.</p>

<p>"I found it by chanss; I knew it by th naems and th inishals, and
in it thaer wuz wun litl vurss that seemd to call me. Red and fiend
him; I wil see that U go not in th wet."</p>

<p>Jo oebaed, and haestily skimd thru th liens which she had
crisend—</p>

<p>"It's verry bad poetry, but I felt it when I roet it, wun dae when I
wuz verry loenly, and had a guud cri on a rag-bag. I never thaut it
wuud go whaer it cuud tel taels," sed Jo, teering up th vurses th
Professor had treasured so long.</p>

<p>"Let it go, it has dun its duty, and I wil haf a fresh wun when I
red all th broun book in which she keeps her litl seecrets," sed
Mr. Bhaer, with a smiel, as he wocht th fragments fli away on th
wiend. "Yes," he aded urnestly, "I red that, and I think to mieself,
'She has a sorro, she is loenly, she wuud fiend cumfort in troo
luv. I haf a hart fuul, fuul for her; shal I not go and sae, 'If this is
<span class="pagenum2">572</span>
not too puur a thing to gif for whut I shal hoep to reseev, taek it in
Gott's naem?'"</p>

<p>"And so U caem to fiend that it wuz not too puur, but th wun
precious thing I needed," whisperd Jo.</p>

<p>"I had no curej to think that at furst, hevenly kiend as wuz yuur
welcum to me. But soon I began to hoep, and then I sed, 'I wil
haf her if I die for it,' and so I wil!" cried Mr. Bhaer, with a defieant
nod, as if th wauls of mist cloezing round them wer barriers which he
wuz to sermount or valiantly nok doun.</p>

<p>Jo thaut that wuz splendid, and rezolvd to be wurthy of her
niet, tho he did not cum pransing on a charger in gorjus
arae.</p>

<p>"Whut maed U stae away so long?" she askt prezently, fiending
it so plezant to ask confidenshal qeschons and get delietful ansers
that she cuud not keep silent.</p>

<p>"It wuz not eezy, but I cuud not fiend th hart to taek U from
that so hapy hoem until I cuud haf a prospekt of wun to giv U,
after much tiem, perhaps, and hard wurk. How cuud I ask U to
gif up so much for a puur oeld felo, hoo has no forchun but a litl
lurning?"</p>

<p>"I'm glad U <em>ar</em> puur; I couldn't baer a rich huzband," sed
Jo decidedly, ading, in a softer toen, "Don't feer poverty; I've
noen it long enough to looz mi dred, and be hapy wurking for
thoes I luv; and don't call yuurself oeld,—forty is th priem of lief.
I couldn't help luving U if U wer seventy!"</p>

<p>Th Professor found that so tuching that he wuud hav been
glad of his hankerchif, if he cuud hav got at it; as he couldn't,
Jo wiept his ies for him, and sed, lafing, as she tuuk away a
bundle or too,—</p>

<p>"I mae be strong-miended, but no wun can sae I'm out of mi sfeer

bearing burdens. I'm to carry mi shaer, Friedrich, and help to

<p>"We shal see. Haf U paeshenss to waet a long tiem, Jo? I must
go away and do mi wurk aloen. I must help mi boys furst, because,
<span class="pagenum2">573</span>
eeven for U, I mae not braek mi wurd to Minna. Can U forgif

them."</p>

<p>"Thaer's a truly Joian plan for U! Isn't that just liek her?"
cried Laurie, apeeling to th family, hoo luukt as much serpriezd
as he.</p>

<p>"I liek it," sed Mrs. March decidedly.</p>

<p>"So do I," aded her huzband, hoo welcumd th thaut of a
chanss for trieing th Socratic method of ejucaeshon on modern yooth.</p>

<p>"It wil be an imenss caer for Jo," sed Meg, stroeking th hed
of her wun all-absorbing sun.</p>

<p>"Jo can do it, and be hapy in it. It's a splendid iedeea. Tel us all
about it," cried Mr. Laurence, hoo had been longing to lend th
luvers a hand, but knew that thae wuud refuez his help.</p>

<p>"I knew U'd stand by me, sur. Amy duz too—I see it in her
ies, tho she proodently waets to turn it oever in her miend befor
she speeks. Now, mi deer peepl," continued Jo urnestly, "just
understand that this isn't a nue iedeea of mien, but a long-cherrisht
plan. Befor mi Fritz caem, I uezd to think how, when I'd maed mi
forchun, and no wun needed me at hoem, I'd hier a big hous, and pik
up sum puur, forlorn litl lads, hoo hadn't any muthers, and taek
caer of them, and maek lief joly for them befor it wuz too laet. I
see so meny going to rooin, for wont of help at th riet mienuet; I
luv so to do anything for them; I seem to feel thaer wonts, and sympathize
with thaer trubls, and, o, I should <em>so</em> liek to be a muther
to them!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">577</span>
Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo, hoo tuuk it, smieling, with teers
in her ies, and went on in th oeld enthusiastic wae, which thae had
not seen for a long whiel.</p>

<p>"I toeld mi plan to Fritz wunss, and he sed it wuz just whut he
wuud liek, and agreed to tri it when we got rich. Bles his deer
hart, he's been dooing it all his lief,—helping puur boys, I meen,
not geting rich; that he'll never be; muny doesn't stae in his
poket long enough to lae up any. But now, thanks to mi guud oeld
ant, hoo luvd me beter than I ever dezurvd, <em>I'm</em> rich, at leest I
feel so, and we can liv at Plumfield perfectly wel, if we hav a flurishing
scool. It's just th plaess for boys, th hous is big, and th
furnicher strong and plaen. Thaer's plenty of room for duzens insied,
and splendid grounds outsied. Thae cuud help in th garden and
orchard: such wurk is helthy, isn't it, sur? Then Fritz can traen and
teech in his oen wae, and faather wil help him. I can feed and nurss
and pet and scoeld them; and muther wil be mi stand-by. I've
aulwaes longed for lots of boys, and never had enough; now I can fil
th hous fuul, and revel in th litl dears to mi hart's content.
Think whut lukshery,—Plumfield mi oen, and a wildernes of boys to
enjoy it with me!"</p>

<p>As Jo waevd her hands, and gaev a sie of rapcher, th family went
off into a gael of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laft till thae
thaut he'd hav an apoplektik fit.</p>

<p>"I don't see anything funy," she sed gravely, when she cuud be
hurd. "Nuthing cuud be mor nacheral or proper than for mi Professor
to oepen a scool, and for me to prefur to rezied on mi oen
estate."</p>

<p>"She is putting on aers aulredy," sed Laurie, hoo regarded th
iedeea in th liet of a capital joek. "But mae I inqier how U intend
to suport th establishment? If all th pupils ar litl ragamufins,
I'm afraed yuur crop wun't be profitabl in a wurldly senss,
Mrs. Bhaer."</p>

<p>"Now don't be a wet-blanket, Teddy. Of corss I shal hav rich
pupils, aulso,—perhaps begin with such aultogether; then, when I've
got a start, I can taek a ragamufin or too, just for a relish. Rich
peepl's children ofen need caer and cumfort, as wel as puur. I've
<span class="pagenum2">578</span>
seen unforchunat litl creechers left to survants, or bakward wuns
pushed forward, when it's reeal crooelty. Sum ar nauty thru
mismanejment or neglekt, and sum looz thaer muthers. Besieds,
th best hav to get thru th hobbledehoy aej, and that's th verry
tiem thae need moest paeshenss and kiendnes. Peepl laf at them,
and husl them about, tri to keep them out of siet, and expect
them to turn, all at wunss, from prity children into fien yung men.
Thae don't complaen much,—plucky litl soels,—but thae feel it.
I've been thru sumthing of it, and I noe all about it. I've a
speshal interest in such yung baers, and liek to sho them that I see
th worm, onest, wel-meening boys' harts, in spiet of th clumzy
arms and legs and th topsy-turvy heds. I've had expeeri’enss, too,
for haeven't I brought up wun boy to be a pride and onor to his
family?"</p>

<p>"I'll testifi that U tried to do it," sed Laurie, with a graetful
luuk.</p>

<p>"And I've succeeded beyond mi hoeps; for heer U ar, a steady,
sensibl business man, dooing heeps of guud with yuur muny, and
laeing up th blessings of th puur, insted of dolars. But U ar
not meerly a business man: U luv guud and buetiful things, enjoy
them yuurself, and let others go havs, as U aulwaes did in th oeld
times. I <em>am</em> proud of U, Teddy, for U get beter every yeer, and
every wun feels it, tho U wun't let them sae so. Yes, and when
I hav mi flok, I'll just pointer to U, and sae, 'Thaer's yuur model,
mi lads.'"</p>

<p>Puur Laurie didn't noe whaer to luuk; for, man tho he wuz,
sumthing of th oeld bashfulness caem oever him as this burst of praez
maed all faeses turn approvingly upon him.</p>

<p>"I sae, Jo, that's rather too much," he began, just in his oeld boyish
wae. "U hav all dun mor for me than I can ever thank U for,
exsept by dooing mi best not to disapoint U. U hav rather cast
me off laetly, Jo, but I've had th best of help, nevertheles; so, if
I've got on at all, U mae thank thees too for it;" and he laed wun
hand jently on his grandfaather's whiet hed, th uther on Amy's goelden
wun, for th three wer never far apart.</p>

<p>"I do think that familys ar th moest buetiful things in all th
<span class="pagenum2">579</span>
wurld!" burst out Jo, hoo wuz in an unuezhualy uplifted fraem of
miend just then. "When I hav wun of mi oen, I hoep it wil be as
hapy as th three I noe and luv th best. If John and mi Fritz
wer oenly heer, it wuud be qiet a litl heven on urth," she aded
mor qieetly. And that niet, when she went to her room, after a
blissful evening of family counsels, hoeps, and plans, her hart wuz so
fuul of hapynes that she cuud oenly calm it by neeling besied th
empty bed aulwaes neer her oen, and thinking tender thoughts of
Beth.</p>

<p>It wuz a verry astonishing yeer aultogether, for things seemd to hapen
in an unuezhualy rapid and delietful maner. Aulmoest befor she
knew whaer she wuz, Jo found herself marryd and setld at Plumfield.
Then a family of six or seven boys sprung up liek mushrooms,
and flurisht surprisingly, puur boys as wel as rich; for Mr. Laurence
wuz continually fiending sum tuching caess of destitooshon, and
beging th Bhaers to taek pity on th chield, and he wuud gladly pae
a trifle for its suport. In this wae th sli oeld jentlman got round
proud Jo, and furnisht her with th stiel of boy in which she moest
delieted.</p>

<p>Of corss it wuz up-hil wurk at furst, and Jo maed qeer mistaeks;
but th wiez Professor steerd her saefly into calmer wauters, and th
moest rampant ragamufin wuz conkerd in th end. How Jo did
enjoy her "wildernes of boys," and how puur, deer Ant March
wuud hav lamented had she been thaer to see th saecred precincts
of prim, wel-orderd Plumfield oever-run with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys!
Thaer wuz a sort of poeetik justis about it, after all, for th oeld
laedy had been th terror of th boys for miels round; and now th
exiles feested freely on forbiden plums, kikt up th gravel with
profane boots unreproved, and plaed criket in th big feeld whaer
th iritabl "cow with a crumpld horn" uezd to inviet rash youths
to cum and be tost. It becaem a sort of boys' paradise, and
Laurie sugjested that it should be called th "Bhaer-garten," as a
compliment to its master and aproepriat to its inhabitants.</p>

<p>It never wuz a fashonabl scool, and th Professor did not lae up
a forchun; but it <em>wuz</em> just whut Jo intended it to be,—"a hapy,
homelike plaess for boys, hoo needed teeching, caer, and kiendnes."
<span class="pagenum2">580</span>
Every room in th big hous wuz soon fuul; every litl plot in th
garden soon had its oener; a reguelar menajery apeerd in barn and
shed, for pet animals wer alowd; and, three times a dae, Jo smield
at her Fritz from th hed of a long taebl liend on eether sied with
roes of hapy yung faeses, which all turnd to her with affectionate
ies, confieding wurds, and graetful harts, fuul of luv for "Muther
Bhaer." She had boys enough now, and did not tier of them, tho
thae wer not aenjels, by any means, and sum of them cauzd boeth
Professor and Professorin much trubl and anxiety. But her faeth in
th guud spot which exists in th hart of th nautyest, sausyest,
moest tantaliezing litl ragamufin gaev her paeshenss, skil, and, in tiem,
success; for no mortal boy cuud hoeld out long with Faather Bhaer
shiening on him as benevolently as th sun, and Muther Bhaer forgiving
him seventy times seven. Verry precious to Jo wuz th frendship of
th lads; thaer penitent sniffs and whispers after rong-dooing; thaer
droel or tuching litl confidenses; thaer plezant enthusiasms, hoeps,
and plans; eeven thaer misforchuns, for thae oenly endeerd them to her
all th mor. Thaer wer slo boys and bashful boys; feebl boys
and rieotus boys; boys that lispt and boys that stuterd; wun or too
laem wuns; and a merry litl quadroon, hoo cuud not be taeken in
elsewhere, but hoo wuz welcum to th "Bhaer-garten," tho sum
peepl predikted that his admishon wuud rooin th scool.</p>

<p>Yes; Jo wuz a verry hapy wuuman thaer, in spiet of hard wurk, much
anxiety, and a perpechual raket. She enjoyd it hartily, and found
th aplauz of her boys mor satisfieing than any praez of th wurld;
for now she toeld no storys exsept to her flok of enthusiastic believers
and admierers. As th yeers went on, too litl lads of her oen caem
to increess her hapynes,—Rob, naemd for grandpa, and Teddy,
a hapy-go-luky baeby, hoo seemd to hav inherrited his papa's sunshiny
temper as wel as his muther's lievly spirit. How thae ever groo
up aliev in that whurlpool of boys wuz a mistery to thaer grandmaa and
aunts; but thae flurisht liek dandelions in spring, and thaer ruf
nurses luvd and survd them wel.</p>

<p>Thaer wer a graet meny holidaes at Plumfield, and wun of th moest
delietful wuz th yeerly apl-piking; for then th Marches, Laurences,
Brookes, and Bhaers turnd out in fuul forss, and maed a dae
<span class="pagenum2">581</span>
of it. Fiev yeers after Jo's weding, wun of thees frootful festivals
ocurd,—a melo October dae, when th aer wuz fuul of an exhilarating
freshnes which maed th spirits riez, and th blud danss helthily
in th vaens. Th oeld orchard wor its holidae atier; goelden-rod and
asters frinjd th mosy wauls; gras-hopers skipt briskly in th
sere gras, and crikets churpt liek faery pipers at a feest; squirrels
wer busy with thaer small harvesting; burds twittered thaer adieux from
th alders in th laen; and every tree stuud redy to send doun its
shower of red or yelo apples at th furst shaek. Everybody wuz
thaer; everybody laft and sang, cliemd up and tumbld doun;
everybody declaerd that thaer never had been such a perfect dae or
such a joly set to enjoy it; and every wun gaev themselvs up to th
simpl plezhers of th our as freely as if thaer wer no such things
as caer or sorro in th wurld.</p>

<p>Mr. March stroeld plasidly about, qoeting Tusser, Cowley, and
Columella to Mr. Laurence, whiel enjoying—</p>

<p class="center">"Th jentl apl's winey jooss."</p>

<p class="noindent">
Th Professor charjd up and doun th green iels liek a stout
Teutonic niet, with a poel for a lanss, leeding on th boys, hoo
maed a huuk and lader company of themselvs, and performed
wunders in th wae of ground and lofty tumbling. Laurie devoeted
himself to th litl wuns, roed his small dauter in a bushel-basket,
tuuk Daezy up amung th burds' nests, and kept advencherus Rob
from braeking his nek. Mrs. March and Meg sat amung th apl
piels liek a paer of Pomonas, sorting th contributions that kept poring
in; whiel Amy, with a buetiful mutherly expreshon in her faess,
skecht th vaerius groops, and wocht oever wun pale lad, hoo sat
adoring her with his litl cruch besied him.</p>

<p>Jo wuz in her element that dae, and rusht about, with her goun
pind up, her hat anywhere but on her hed, and her baeby tukt
under her arm, redy for any lievly advencher which miet turn up.
Litl Teddy bor a charmd lief, for nuthing ever happened to him,
and Jo never felt any anxiety when he wuz whiskt up into a tree by
wun lad, galopt off on th bak of anuther, or suplied with sour
russets by his induljent papa, hoo laebord under th Germanic deloozhon
<span class="pagenum2">582</span>
that baebys cuud diejest anything, from pikld cabbage to
butons, naels, and thaer oen small shoos. She knew that litl Ted
wuud turn up again in tiem, saef and
roezy, durty and sereen, and she aulwaes
reseevd him bak with a harty welcum,
for Jo luvd her baebys tenderly.</p>

<p>At foer o'clok a lul tuuk plaess, and
baskets remaend empty, whiel th apl-pickers
rested, and compaerd rents and
broozes. Then Jo and Meg, with a detachment
of th biger boys, set forth
th super on th gras, for an out-of-dor
tee wuz aulwaes th crouning joy
of th dae. Th land literaly floed
with milk and huny on such ocaezhons,
for th lads wer not reqierd to sit
at taebl, but alowd to partaek of refreshment
as thae liked,—freedom being
th saus best beluved by th boyish
soel. Thae availed themselvs of th
raer privilej to th fuulest extent, for
sum tried th pleezing experriment of
drinking milk whiel standing on thaer
heds, others lent a charm to leep-frog
by eating pie in th pauses of th gaem,
cuukys wer soen broadcast oever th
feeld, and apl-turnovers roosted in th
trees liek a nue stiel of burd. Th litl
gurls had a private tee-party, and Ted
roevd amung th edibls at his oen sweet
wil.</p>

<p>When no wun cuud eat any mor, th
Professor propoezd th furst reguelar toest, which wuz aulwaes drunk at
such times,—"Ant March, God bles her!" A toest hartily given
by th guud man, hoo never forgot how much he oed her, and
<span class="pagenum2">583</span>
qieetly drunk by th boys, hoo had been taut to keep her memory
green.</p>

<p>"Now, grandmaa's sixtieth burthdae! Long lief to her, with three
times three!"</p>

<p>That wuz given with a wil, as U mae wel beleev; and th cheering
wunss begun, it wuz hard to stop it. Everybody's helth wuz propoezd,
from Mr. Laurence, hoo wuz considerd thaer speshal patron,
to th astonisht guinea-pig, hoo had straed from its proper sfeer
in surch of its yung master. Demi, as th oeldest grandchield, then
prezented th qeen of th dae with vaerius gifts, so nuemerus that
thae wer transported to th festiv seen in a wheelbarro. Funy
prezents, sum of them, but whut wuud hav been defekts to uther
ies wer ornaments to grandmaa's,—for th children's gifts wer all
thaer oen. Every stitch Daezy's paeshent litl finggers had put into
th hankerchifs she hemd wuz beter than embroidery to Mrs.
March; Demi's shoo-box wuz a mirakl of mecanikal skil, tho
th cuver wouldn't shut; Rob's fuutstool had a wigl in its uneeven
legs, that she declaerd wuz verry soothing; and no paej of th costly
book Amy's chield gaev her wuz so faer as that on which apeerd, in
tipsy capitals, th wurds,—"To deer Grandmaa, from her litl Beth."</p>

<p>Duuring this serremoeny th boys had misteeriusly disapeerd; and,
when Mrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broeken doun,
whiel Teddy wiept her ies on his pinafore, th Professor sudenly
began to sing. Then, from abuv him, vois after vois tuuk up th
wurds, and from tree to tree ecoed th muezik of th unseen qier, as
th boys sung, with all thaer harts, th litl song Jo had riten,
Laurie set to muezik, and th Professor traend his lads to giv with
th best efekt. This wuz sumthing aultogether nue, and it proovd a
grand success; for Mrs. March couldn't get oever her serpriez, and
insisted on shaeking hands with every wun of th fetherles burds, from
taul Franz and Emil to th litl quadroon, hoo had th sweetest vois
of all.</p>

<p>After this, th boys dispurst for a fienal lark, leeving Mrs. March
and her dauters under th festival tree.</p>

<p>"I don't think I ever aut to call mieself 'Unluky Jo' again,
when mi graetest wish has been so beautifully gratified," sed Mrs.
<span class="pagenum2">584</span>
Bhaer, taeking Teddy's litl fist out of th milk-pitcher, in which he
wuz rapcherusly churning.</p>

<p>"And yet yuur lief is verry diferent from th wun U pikcherd so
long ago. Do U remember our casls in th aer?" askt Amy,
smieling as she wocht Laurie and John plaeing criket with th
boys.</p>

<p>"Deer feloes! It duz mi hart guud to see them forget business,
and frolik for a dae," anserd Jo, hoo now spoek in a maturnal
wae of all man-kiend. "Yes, I remember; but th lief I wontedw then
seems selfish, loenly, and coeld to me now. I haeven't given up th
hoep that I mae riet a guud book yet, but I can waet, and I'm shuur
it wil be all th beter for such expeeri’enses and ilustraeshons as thees;"
and Jo pointed from th lievly lads in th distanss to her faather, leening
on th Professor's arm, as thae waukt to and fro in th sunshine,
deep in wun of th conversations which boeth enjoyd so much, and
then to her muther, sitting enthroned amung her dauters, with thaer
children in her lap and at her feet, as if all found help and hapynes
in th faess which never cuud gro oeld to them.</p>

<p>"Mi casl wuz th moest neerly reealiezd of all. I askt for splendid
things, to be shuur, but in mi hart I knew I should be satisfied, if
I had a litl hoem, and John, and sum deer children liek thees.
I've got them all, thank God, and am th hapyest wuuman in th
wurld;" and Meg laed her hand on her taul boy's hed, with a faess fuul
of tender and devout content.</p>

<p>"Mi casl is verry diferent from whut I pland, but I wuud not
aulter it, tho, liek Jo, I don't relinqish all mi artistik hoeps, or
confien mieself to helping others fuulfil thaer dreems of buety. I've
begun to model a figuer of baeby, and Laurie sez it is th best thing
I've ever dun. I think so mieself, and meen to do it in marbl,
so that, whotever happens, I mae at leest keep th imej of mi litl
aenjel."</p>

<p>As Amy spoek, a graet teer dropt on th goelden haer of th sleeping
chield in her arms; for her wun wel-beluved dauter wuz a frael
litl creecher and th dred of loozing her wuz th shado oever Amy's
sunshine. This cros wuz dooing much for boeth faather and muther, for
wun luv and sorro bound them cloesly together. Amy's naechuur wuz
<span class="pagenum2">585</span>
groeing sweeter, deeper, and mor tender; Laurie wuz groeing mor
seerius, strong, and furm; and boeth wer lurning that buety, yooth,
guud forchun, eeven luv itself, cannot keep caer and paen, lost and

   "Into eech lief sum raen must faul,</p>
<p class="indent25 left-indent10">

</div>

<p>"She is groeing beter, I am shuur of it, mi deer. Don't despond,
but hoep and keep hapy," sed Mrs. March, as tender-hearted Daezy
stoopt from her nee, to lae her roezy cheek against her litl cuzin's
pale wun.</p>

<p>"I never aut to, whiel I hav U to cheer me up, Marmee, and
Laurie to taek mor than haf of every burden," replied Amy wormly.
"He never lets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet and paeshent with
me, so devoeted to Beth, and such a stae and cumfort to me aulwaes,
that I can't luv him enough. So, in spiet of mi wun cros, I can sae
with Meg, 'Thank God, I'm a hapy wuuman.'"</p>

<p>"Thaer's no need for me to sae it, for every wun can see that I'm
far hapyer than I dezurv," aded Jo, glansing from her guud huzband
to her chuby children, tumbling on th gras besied her. "Fritz is
geting grae and stout; I'm groeing as thin as a shado, and am thurty;
we never shal be rich, and Plumfield mae burn up any niet, for that
incorijibl Tommy Bangs <em>wil</em> smoek sweet-furn sigars under th
bed-cloeths, tho he's set himself afire three times aulredy. But
in spiet of thees unromantik fakts, I hav nuthing to complaen of, and
never wuz so joly in mi lief. Excuez th remark, but living amung
boys, I can't help uezing thaer expreshons now and then."</p>

<p>"Yes, Jo, I think yuur harvest wil be a guud wun," began Mrs.
March, frietening away a big blak criket that wuz staering Teddy out
of countenanss.</p>

<p>"Not haf so guud as yuurs, muther. Heer it is, and we never
can thank U enough for th paeshent soeing and reeping U hav
dun," cried Jo, with th luving impechuosity which she never cuud
outgro.</p>

<p>"I hoep thaer wil be mor wheet and fueer tares every yeer," sed
Amy softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2">586</span>
"A larj sheef, but I noe thaer's room in yuur hart for it, Marmee
deer," aded Meg's tender vois.</p>

<p>Tucht to th hart, Mrs. March cuud oenly strech out her arms,
as if to gather children and grandchildren to herself, and sae, with
faess and vois fuul of mutherly luv, gratitood, and huemility,—</p>

<p>"O, mi gurls, however long U mae liv, I never can wish U a

<p>Welcum to th <span class="smc">Projekt Gutenberg</span> Ilustraeted 
Edishon of Litl Wimen by Louisa Mae Alcott, publisht by Litl, Broun,
and Company.  Sum vurzhons of th book, such as this wun, uez th fuul 
tietl of th book from th tietl paej, <i>Litl Wimen; Or Meg, Jo, Beth, 
and Amy.</i></p>

<p>We uezd th vurzhon of th book from Litl, Broun, and Company: 
copyriet 1896, for this transcripshon.  A scand copy of this book is 
available thru th internet archive, courtesy of th Nue York Public 
Liebraery. </p>

<p>A copy of th furst vurzhon of th novel, publisht in 1869, wuz 
consulted for emendaeshons, th proper rendering of wurds hiefenaeted 
and split between too liens for spaesing, and uther ishoos in 
transcriebing th novel.  We ar not trieing to chaenj this vurzhon
of th novel bak to th 1869 novel, but corekt th errors that
wer maed in re-transcriebing and updaeting th text.</p>

<p>Thru-out th diealogs, wurds wer uezd to mimik accents of 
th speekers. Thoes wurds wer retaend as-is.</p>

<p>Errors in punctuations and hiefenaeshon wer not corekted unles
utherwiez noeted beloe.</p>

<p>Th ilustraeshons hav been moovd so that thae do not braek up
parragrafs and so that thae ar next to th text that thae ilustraet.  
Th paej number of th ilustraeshon miet not mach th paej number in th
List of Ilustraeshons.</p>

<p>On paej vii, in th Taebl of Contents, chaenj paej 7 to 1 for th
begining of Chapter Wun.</p>

<p>In th List of Ilustraeshons, for th ilustraeshon on paej 147,
"postmistress" wuz replaest with "poest-mistres".</p>

<p>In th List of Ilustraeshons, for th ilustraeshon on paej 235,
"tee-pot" wuz replaest with "teepot".</p>

<p>On paej 30, th punctuation after 'staend thae ar' mae be a 
colon, but on paej 41 of th 1869 book, it is a semycoelon.   We 
uezd th semy-colon. </p>

<p>On paej 34, transcrieb red-heded with th hiefen. See paej 44 of th
1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 40, a period wuz aded after "room whaer oeld Mr".  See paej
50 of th 1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 41, th semycoelon after "Laurie went on th box" wuz replaest
with a comma.  See paej 52 of th 1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 62, mantel-peess wuz transcriebd with th hiefen.  See Paej 75
of th 1869 novel. </p>

<p>On paej 63, chekt th clause "and I've been trieing to do it this ever 
so long."  It is riten th saem wae on paej 77 of th 1869 book.
No chaenj wuz maed.</p>

<p>On paej 64, ad period after "red and shiening with merriment." See paej 
79 of th 1869 book.</p>

<p>On paej 68, chaenjd weet to sweet in 'th damp weet aer.' See paej 84
of th 1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 79, ad comma after I remaen in th leter.  See paej 95 of th 
1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 84, ferrule wuz an ajustment from th 1869 book, which oenly 
uezd wun r in speling th wurd (see paej 101). Webster's dikshonaery 
spels ferrule with too rs.  </p>

<p>On paej 109, a period wuz aded after "and th oeld man qiet doets on 
them".  See paej 130 of th 1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 109, a period wuz aded after "askt anuther vois". See paej 131
of th 1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 112, chaenj colon to semycoelon after "if U don't;"—see
paej 134 of th 1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 113, transcrieb eer-rings with th hiefen.  See paej 135 of th
1869 novel.</p>

<p>On Paej 123, "Wun thing remember, mi gurls:" is riten as it apeers
in th 1896 novel. A comma insted of a colon wuz uezd after mi gurls
in th 1869 novel (see paej 146).  "Wun thing <strong>to</strong> 
remember," mae wurk beter todae, or eeven "Remember wun thing," but we left 
this as Ms. Alcott roet it.</p>

<p>On Paej 124, th P. C. is th Pickwick Club from a novel by Charles 
Dickens.  Samuel Pickwick, Tracy Tupman, Augustus Snodgrass, and Nathaniel 
Winkle wer introdued by Charles Dickens in th furst chapter of <i>Th 
Pickwick Paepers</i>.  	Samuel Weller maeks his furst apeeranss
in Chapter Ten of that novel.</p>

<p>On paej 128, in th Pickwick Portfolio, thaer is no period after
"it is neerly scool tiem" in N.&nbsp;Winkle's leter.  This period wuz
aulso mising on paej 151 of th 1869 novel.  Th mising period wuz
intenshonal.</p>

<p>On paej 135, th ambigueus punctuation after "O, deer, no!" is an
exclamation pointer.  See paej 160 of th 1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 146, chaenj buttonholes to buton-hoels.  On paej 173 of th
1869 novel, this wurd wuz hiefenaeted and split between too liens for
spaesing.  Transcriebing th wurd with th hiefen maches seven uther 
ocurenses of buton-hoel or botton-hoels in th novel.  We thaerfor 
uezd th hiefen.</p>

<p>On paej 150, "Betty" wuz replaest with "Bethy".  This error wuz aulso maed
in th 1869 novel—see paej 177.  Th carrakter adrest is Beth. 
</p>

<p>On paej 158, a period wuz aded after "still neeling".  See paej 187
of th 1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 160, "hard a lee" is speld th saem wae in th 1869 novel (see
paej 189) and this novel.  We left this as is.</p>

<p>On paej 166, a comma wuz aded after "Meg" in "Meg oebeedi’ently foloeing".
See paej 195 of th 1869 book.</p>

<p>On paej 185, "receptable" wuz replaest with "reseptakl".  See paej
217 of th 1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 185, transcrieb dor-wae with th hiefen.  See paej 217 of th
1869 novel. Aulso, chaenj dorwae to dor-wae a fue liens doun th saem 
paej.  See paej 218 of th 1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 189, th comma after "publisht every dae" wuz replaest with a
period. See paej 225 of 1869 book.</p>

<p>On paej 198, th clause: "Beth, go and ask Mr. Laurence for a cupl of 
botls of oeld wien:" wuz riten as it apeerd in th 1896 novel.  Th
clause ended in with a semy-colon in th 1869 book (see paej 234). </p>

<p>On paej 200, chaenj needlework to needl-wurk. See paej 236 of th 
1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 209, "turnovers" wuz replaest with "turn-overs". See paej 
246 of th 1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 214, th singgl qoetaeshon mark befor "Hed Nurss of Word" wuz
replaest with a dubl qoetaeshon mark. See paej 252 of th 1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 218, "Yeer's ago" wuz replaest with "Yeers ago". See paej 257
of th 1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 219, "ask him so help" wuz replaest with "ask him to help".
See paej 257 of th 1869 novel.</p>

<p>On paej 219, ad period after "giv it to her." See paej 258 of th 
1869 novel. </p>

<p>On paej 230, "too, A.M." is speld th saem wae, with th comma, in 
this book and in th 1869 novel (on paej 272).  Th comma wuz retaend.</p>

<p>On paej 244, "postscrips" wuz replaest with "postscripts". See paej
287 of th 1869 novel.</p>
