Eighty percent of the words in the English language dictionary do not accurately indicate how they should be pronounced.  Otherwise it wouldn't be necessary to provide pseudo-pronounciation guides after each dictionary word - like <b>"consumption &nbsp; kon-sum'sh(o')n"</b><br><br>
In other words, letters cannot be trusted much of the time to truly signal how a word should be pronounced.  At least half of the words in English use letters in ways that require explanations and repeated promptings from other people.  Most of us (all of us) needed some one to prompt us - usually in the very early years - about how a printed word should be pronounced so that we could "memorize" or "assimilate" or "associate" the sight of many words with it's adopted pronunciation.<br><br>

For most of the reading public, these assimilations occurred when we were very young. Once we made the associations in early years, the spelling anamolies became accepted and common-place. Through repeated encounters and reminders we accept that "this is how words are to be spelled."  We adopt them as they are presented by our parents, tutors, and dictionaries.  An assumption follows that current spellings, seen in dictionaries, were dictated by a supreme authority.<br><br>

Therefore we agree that English words are either spelled "RIGHT" or they are spelled "WRONG."   Misspellings get red circles and check marks in academic endeavours.  Misspelled words "Stand Out" if seen in a book or in news print.<br><br>However, If most English words were spelled consistently, they might be pronounced more easily by adults who are learning to read, but some of the words would look like terribly misspelled words.<br><br> "Bequeath" looks strange if spelled as "Beqeeth."  "Besides" looks strange if spelled as "Besiedz."  Hence there has been reluctance to normalize English spelling standards (otherwise known as "traditional orthography" - or "TO" which is the technical abbreviation.)<br><br>

Letters could be used in quite consistent ways, but the stigma of writing a word like MACHINE in some other way (like MASHEEN) would be rejected by most writers. Worse, readers would think that the writer didn't know how to spell. Therefore attempts at simplifying the spelling of even 1% of our words has been generally rejected with the argument - <b>"I learned English, so let foreigners learn it like I did."</b><br><br>

Unfortunately that isn't happening, as evidenced by the need to write medicine bottle instructions in several languages, street signs in multiple languages, telephone recorded messages in multiple languages, assembly instructions (bookcases, swing-sets, bicycles) all written in multiple languages.  Thirty six million of us simply avoid the hassle of learning this complex bunch of inconsistently-spelled English words.<br><br>

Next to Chinese and Japanese, English is most difficult to learn.  For an adult to become literate in English, they must have repeated encounters with written words.  They require frequent promptings from other persons until they gradually associate (memorize) the erratic placement of letters and what those letters are signaling in each specific instance.  This is not true in most other languages.<br><br>

Some English words have extra letters like lam(b) or dum(b) or i(s)land or (a)i(s)l(e) - aisle.<br><br>
Others use c, k,  and s  erratically.  (comb, coat, kite, cite, site, sight, city, scene, sword)<br><br>
The letters "TI" signal us to make an SH sound in many words that end in "TION" as in NATION or CREATION - except when they sometimes signal other sounds.<br><br>
We have 24 letter combinations that signal us to make the OO sound as in MOON, THROUGH,  RULE, BRUISE, CANOE, FRUIT, SLEUTH, etc. They could all rely on "OO" to convey the single desired sound.<br><br>
We have 15 ways to spell the vowel in MET, such as MANY, SAID, HEAD, FRIEND, DAMAGE, GUEST, BELLE, HEIFER, BURIAL, etc.  They could all use the single letter "E" to signal the desired sound.<br><br>

These examples are short and simple so <b>the scope of the problem is hidden from view.</b>  People who know how to read will argue that it's not that hard to master 10,000 of these inconsistencies.  Others will go even farther - arguing that these "anamolies" in our spelling standards are what make the Englieh language beautiful - something that should never be changed.  The wierd spellings are part of our heritage that ought to be protected - rewarded in spelling bee contests, and honored because classical writers wrote impressive things in traditional orthography. Traditional spelling, codified in dictionaries, has been the basis for our novels, our national discourses, our legal documents, our patents, and our scientific journals.  Therefore the topic of spelling improvements has been met with considerable resistence.

Yet 36 million people are outside our reading circle - growing by 2.4 million more each year.  "Why don't they just learn to read like we did?"<br><br>

Perhaps it's because many non-reading persons have been down this path before.  They've encountered some one who offered to tutor them, or they came to a literacy center once or twice where it was guaranteed they would soon learn to read. But they soon realized that learning to read  was beyond the time they could give to it, and it would require many dozens of prompting sessions from their tutor before they would assimilate the assiciations that English demands. <br><br> 

Once newcomers encounter 10,000 or more words whose spellings are inconsistent and arbitrary, they often give up trying.  Unike Spanish or French, English pronunciations can't be learned in a few 30 minute sessions.<br><br>

Many thousands of irrational inconsistent spellings exist in English.  The written form of the English language has over time deteriorated into a hodge-podge of unexplainable forms that learners must either master or remain illiterate.<br><br>

Spelling is not a subject of study in Spain, Germany, Holland, Russia, or Scandanavia because their written languages use letters quite consistently to signal intended sounds and syllables.  If arithmetic allowed for occassional variances in what 3 + 134 equals, few would learn to do arithmetic.  There's no other area of thought that requires us to filter out unecessary "noise" - noise that's  placed there intentionally to make it harder to figure out - as is true in the written form of English .<br><br>
For those of us who learned at a young age to scan a word, filter-out the unecessary letters, or rearrange letters mentally so that a particular word arouses a memory of the intended pronunciation or meaning, this handicap has become invisible as we grow older. We learned to read at an early age.  Now it's "second nature" and we don't understand what's so hard about learning to read.<br><br>

The problem might be appreciated more if we were dropped (one by one -alone) into Russia or Portugal for six months, then to be tested on how well we adopted that other language.  In most cases other languages use their letters quite consistently, but even with that advantage, you might not pass your driver's license test in that new country for some time.  Learning to read and write in a new second language requires commitment and enormous mental effort - especially if you're an adult migrant worker or short-order cook working 14 hours per day, moving from location to location frequently - and unable to give time or thought to something as demanding as learning English.  Thirty-six million non-reading Americans demonstrate this to be true.
