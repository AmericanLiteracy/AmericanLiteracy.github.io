In Washington State, one in six adults don't have English skills to secure a livable wage job. The combination of all the state’s working age adults who have a high school education or less and younger people ages 18 to 24 who have less than a high school diploma, equals the total size of all high school graduating classes between 2000-2011.   Reference <a href=" http://www.naepdc.org/embargo_until_december_15.htm" target="_blank">&nbsp;http://www.naepdc.org/embargo_until_december_15.htm </a>
<br><br>
Between 1990 and 2000, the non-English speaking adult population in Washington State more than doubled from 117,000 to 261,000. 
<br><br>
Washington State would realize an estimated $3.9 billion increase in total personal income and $1.4 billion in additional tax revenues if all ethnic groups experienced the same educational attainment and earnings as whites.
<br><br>
The tipping point for a student to obtain a livable wage job and a reliable career is one year of college-level courses plus a credential. ESL students who reached this point or beyond earned $7,000 more per year than ESL students who were unable to reach the one-year tipping point. (Referring to Washington State.)

<br><br>
<b>The ability to read and understand complicated information is important to success</b> in college and, increasingly in the workplace. An analysis of the NAEP long-term trend reading assessments reveals that only half of all White 17 year olds, less than one-quarter of Latino 17 year olds, and less than one-fifth of African American 17 year olds can read at this level.
By age 17, only about 1 person in seventeen (17 year olds) can read and gain information from specialized text, for example the science section in the local newspaper. This includes:<br>
1 in 12 White 17 year olds, &nbsp; 1 in 50 Latino 17 year olds,<br>
1 in 100 African American 17 year olds. &nbsp; (Haycock, p5)
<br><br>
Typically 60% of the people in school grades 1 to 12 are raised by a single parent, sometimes working two jobs, surviving on food stamps and welfare checks.
<br><br>
Literacy continues to decline in the U.S. despite massive campaigns and dollars provided by federal and state initiatives.
<br><br>
Only one country spends more per pupil than the United States - Switzerland.
<br><br>
When a child has fallen two grade levels behind the rest of the class and has not mastered reading, upon reaching 9th grade, that person is now two years older than others in the class.  Menial jobs will seem alluring, and he or she is 90% at risk of dropping out of school.

"After trying New Age touchy-feely ways to educate children in California, parents and politicians decided it would be good for kids to learn to spell.  Assembly bill 1504 requires the State Board of Education to adopt spelling books.  None were in use in 1995 when the bill was introduced.  They stated "We ended up with math books that had no arithmetic and literature books without reading skills."  Books that referenced phonics or spelling had been banned from state-approved lists five years earlier.  Five years later, tests revealed that California reading scores ranked last among the 39 states tested.  Only the Island of Guam had worse scores.  (Chicago Tribune May 14, 1995)"

From 1992 to 2003, adults made no progress in their ability to read sentences and paragraphs or understand other printed material such as bus schedules or prescription labels. 
<br><br>
Even as more people get a formal education, the literacy rate continues to fall.  High school dropouts and free flowing immigrants keep the literacy rate in perpetual decline.
<br><br>
Adults with ability to perform challenging and complex reading tasks made an average yearly salary of $50,700 (euro42,250) in 2003. That is $28,000 (euro23,330) more than those who lacked basic skills.
