Thousands of corporations offers funds and initiatives related literacy projects and reading programs. Some of the corporate serve local communities only.  Others have national and international programs.  When searching on the internet, think up the name of any well-known companies and search for their name plus the word "literacy" or the word "foundation."
<br><br>
Corporations welcome the visibility these programs give to their corporate name and image.  The costs are deductible from taxes in most cases.  Literacy grants and programs give the corporation yet another change to issue press releases in the form of progress reports.  Corporations also hire literacy experts to design and manage their initiatives.  The samples below are randomly chosen.  Common searching of the Internet yields over 2 million results, typically with Verizon, IBM and Visa near the top.

<b>Education World:  Tips for Successful Grant Writing and Resources." </b>
"The second grant I received was a Technology Literacy Challenge Fund (TLCF) grant; federal money funneled through the Pennsylvania Department of Education and awarded by them. That grant, awarded in 2000-2001, was for $187,500. (I applied for $250,000 but was funded for a smaller amount.) The grant was for a technology training program for the teachers in our district, and it included using the FutureKids Professional Development Curriculum, purchasing additional computers and projectors, and paying for trainers."

<b>The Role of Corporate Giving in Adult Literacy </b> 76 pp. This study was funded by Verizon, Inc. and coauthored by Forrest P. Chisman and Gail Spangenberg of the Council for Advancement of Adult Literacy (March, 2006).  Based on a nine-month study conducted by CAAL in 2005, it examines the role and impact of corporate giving in adult literacy at both the national and local levels. The study includes findings from a web-based survey of local literacy programs. By any number of measures it found that corporations play an essential, instrumental role in adult literacy, funding innovation and other activities for which no other funding is available at both the national and local levels.
