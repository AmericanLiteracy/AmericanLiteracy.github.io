      <DIV class="CL10">Suppose you moved to a country where consumers had to pay 
      for imports from Britain in pounds, from Europe in euros, from China in 
      yuan, from Mexico in pesos and so on. You needed a local currency, too, 
      for products of domestic origin. Now also suppose that you came across a 
      book that purported to explain what a delightful arrangement this was -- 
      no place else had half as interesting a monetary system! Might you not 
      think the author had chosen a tough row to hoe?

      style="float:left; border-right:6px solid white; border-top:4px solid white;"> 
     <b>"Spellbound: The Surprising Origins and Astonishing 
      Secrets of English Spelling,"</b> by James Essinger, arouses similar 
      skepticism. "Our marvel and wonder at our heritage as users of the English 
      spelling system," the author writes, "have not worn off in 1,500 years and 
      surely never shall. We are destined to be spellbound by English spelling 
      forever."
      <br><br>
       That's one way to look at it.
It's an innocently through-rose-colored-glasses way: Mr. 
      Essinger is in love with the history of writing. His enthusiasm is 
      contagious when he is discussing, say, how the stylized pictures of 
      Egyptian hieroglyphics are able to represent much more than the things the 
      pictures look like or how farsighted King Alfred the Great was in 
      promoting Anglo-Saxon writing. About a particular translation of Alfred's 
      into Anglo-Saxon, Mr. Essinger writes, charmingly: "It's one of those 
      pieces of writing that make you realize with completely fresh awareness 
      that history isn't merely some dry, formal chronicle of the past, but that 
      it consists of the accounts of the lives of real, breathing living people 
      who simply happen no longer to be alive."
      <br><br>
      In "Spellbound" there is also material more directly 
      relevant to contemporary language. For instance, Mr. Essinger explains 
      convincingly why our verb inflections are as simple as they are ("I speak, 
      you speak, he speaks . . . ") and why our nouns have no grammatical 
      gender. When languages intermingle, their grammars tend to become 
      simplified, for the sake of mutual comprehension. Middle English was 
      essentially a hybridization of Anglo-Saxon and Norman French, and in the 
      process of blending the two languages, some grammatical elements got 
      stripped away.<br><br>Mr. Essinger is keen on the oddities of our spelling. 
      Words like "heir," "honest" and "hour" start with "h" because Norman 
      French, in turn, was influenced by classical Latin; even though the French 
      never sounded the letter, they were only too happy to keep writing "h" 
      where the Romans had written it. "Pauper" and "poor" differ because we 
      borrowed "pauper" directly from Latin, whereas we adapted "poor" from its 
      Norman French descendant "povre."
      <br><br>
      We write "drought" and "night" like that because Chaucer 
      and his contemporaries pronounced them something like "drocht" and 
      "nicht." And Samuel Johnson, having chosen to base his enormously 
      influential dictionary on a "perusal of our writers" rather than on a 
      consistent spelling system of his own devising, has a lot to answer for. 
      "I have often been obliged to sacrifice uniformity to custom," Johnson 
      reported in his preface. "Thus I write, in compliance with a numberless 
      majority, 'convey' and 'inveigh,' 'deceit' and 'receipt,' 'fancy' and 
      'phantom.'"<br>

            style="width:245px; height:174ps; float:left; border-right:6px solid white; border-top:4px solid white;"> 
            The vagaries of a mongrel tongue make spelling 
            bees an adventure<br><br>
   I'm afraid I don't delight in such quirks the way Mr. 
      Essinger does. Spelling is the main thing holding our language back from 
      becoming a true global lingua franca. Among alphabetically written 
      languages, English may be the least phonetic on the planet. Many more 
      people speak it as a second or foreign language than have it as their 
      mother tongue. Most of them don't give a hoot about the historical and 
      cultural baggage that written English hauls around; they just want to do 
      business.<br><br>
       Learning to write any language tends to be harder than speaking 
      it. And when you throw in that English words as similar on the page as 
      "bough," "cough," "dough" and "enough" don't even come close to rhyming, 
      it seems to me we're begging to have our spelling "system" overhauled by 
      tough-minded non-native-speakers.<br><br>
      Mr. Essinger is dismissive of spelling reform. He is 
      right that attempts at comprehensive reform have thus far been failures. 
      The ones that use only the 26 letters of our alphabet seem predestined to 
      fail, because spoken English contains more than 26 sounds. But that's what 
      the 44 symbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet are for. Mr. 
      Essinger thinks that "purely phonetic writing looks absolutely 
      horrendous." Well, I for one think IPA looks great. You know those 
      runic-looking pronunciation symbols in dictionaries? That's it, or a 
      variant thereof.<br><br>
      The book's coverage of subjects I know well can be 
      inexact. For example, Mr. Essinger says the number of English words is 
      "probably" "in excess of 100,000, including technical terms," whereas, 
      according to the publishers of the Oxford English Dictionary, there are at 
      least "a quarter of a million distinct English words," without including 
      technical terms.<br><br>
      And "Spellbound," which was originally published in 
      Britain last year, takes much more of a British point of view on spelling 
      than an American one. The book's language and spelling have been 
      Americanized for this edition, but a number of cultural references have 
      not. So, for instance, the author writes: "We make jokes today about rural 
      people speaking of such very plain things as mangel-wurzels in guttural 
      rural accents." We do? As I said, certain aspects of "Spellbound" arouse 
      skepticism.<<br><br>
