<b>Literacy in Everyday Life: Results from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy. </b>&nbsp; &nbsp;
The mother lode of all surveys, this assessment enables the deepest pockets of illiteracy to be visible - both at the county map level, and in terms of numbers that classify the level of reading skills. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) assessed English literacy skills of a nationally representative sample of more than 19,000 U.S. adults (age 16 and older) residing in households and prisons. NAAL is the first national assessment of adult literacy since the 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey.
<br><br>
Three types of literacy were measured: Prose, Document, and Quantitative. Results were reported in terms of scale scores (on a 500-point scale) and in terms of four literacy levels—Below Basic, Basic, Intermediate, and Proficient. This report, <u>Literacy in Everyday Life,</u> presents findings from the 2003 assessment. It examines changes in literacy levels for the total adult population of the United States, as well as for adults with different demographic characteristics (gender, race, age, and ethnicity). Changes in literacy levels are reported for 2003 as well as between 1992 and 2003. 
<br><br>Specifically, this report describes the relationship between literacy and a number of self-reported background characteristics including education, employment, earnings, job training, family literacy practices, civics activities, and computer usage. It examines the relationship between educational attainment and literacy and reports changes between 1992 and 2003. In addition, the relationship between literacy and adult education, including basic skills classes, English as a second language classes, and information technology certification is reported.
<br><br>The findings discuss the relationship between literacy and employment status, occupation, weekly wage or salary, job training, and participation in public assistance programs. Moreover, the report examines how parents, grandparents, and guardians at different literacy levels interact with the children living in their homes around issues related to literacy and school.
