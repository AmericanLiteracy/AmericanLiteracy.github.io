      </span>The National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS) is a comprehensive study

      of adult literacy conducted in 1992 by the Educational Testing Service on

      behalf of the U.S. Department of Education. The study measured the English

      literacy skills of a random sample of over 26,000 individuals in the

      United States aged 16 years and older.&nbsp;<o:p>

      </span>In the study, participants were interviewed and asked to respond to

      a series of commonly encountered literacy tasks such as reading a bus

      schedule, using an automatic teller machine, or understanding a judge’s

      instructions to a jury. Each participant received proficiency scores in

      three different areas: prose, document, and quantitative literacy. The

      results in each area were divided into five levels, with those at Level 1

      being least proficient and those at Level 5 being most proficient.&nbsp;<o:p>

      </o:p>

      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">What are the

      findings of the study?<span style="font-size:3.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>

      </o:p>

      </span></b></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>The study found that between 21% and 23% of American adults are

      functioning at the lowest level. This is approximately 40 to 44 million

      people. At most, people at Level 1 are able to perform tasks involving

      “brief, uncomplicated text,” such as totaling the entry on a bank

      deposit slip or locating information in a short news article, but many do

      so with difficulty. Others are unable to do so at all.<o:p>

      </o:p>

      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>An additional 25 to 28% of the participants, representing 50

      million American adults, are functioning at the Level 2. Those at this

      level have skills that the Department of Education describes as “more

      varied” than those at Level 1 but “still quite limited.” They are

      able to locate information in a text, locate a particular intersection on

      a map, or determine the difference in price of two items. However, they

      have “considerable difficulty” carrying out tasks requiring them to

      use long texts or do 2-step calculations.&nbsp;<o:p>

      </o:p>

      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>Interestingly, many respondents at Levels 1 and 2 did not consider

      themselves “at risk” because of their literacy skills. A majority of

      those at Level 1 and almost all those at Level 2 described themselves as

      being able to read English “well” or “very well.”&nbsp;<o:p>

      </o:p>

      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>Approximately 33% of the participants, representing 61 million

      adults, had Level 3 skills. They could integrate information relatively

      easily from long texts, and perform more complicated tasks where

      quantities needed to be inferred from the narrative.&nbsp;<o:p>

      </o:p>

      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>18 to 21% of the respondents, representing 34 to 40 million adults,

      performed at Levels 4 or 5. At these levels participants could

      successfully complete the most challenging tasks requiring the use of long

      and complex texts.&nbsp;<o:p>

      </o:p>

      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Which groups

      are most at risk of having the lowest level literacy skills?</b><span style="font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>

      </o:p>

      </span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>Not surprisingly, those with the fewest years of education and

      those who are new to the United States were most likely to have limited

      literacy skills. 25% of the respondents at Level 1 were immigrants, and

      62% had ended school before completing high school. A third were aged 65

      or older, and 26% had physical or mental health conditions that prevented

      them from fully participating in everyday life. 19% reported that they had

      visual difficulties.&nbsp;<o:p>

      </o:p>

      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>Respondents in Level 1 were more likely than those scoring at

      higher levels to have low incomes and fewer annual weeks of employment.

      Median income for those at Level 1 was about $240 per week, compared with

      approximately $650 for those at Level 5. Those at Level 1 reported an

      average of 18 to 19 weeks of employment in the previous year, while those

      at the three highest levels reported between 34 and 44 weeks of

      employment. Almost 44% of those at Level 1 were living below the poverty

      level.&nbsp;<o:p>

      </o:p>

      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>Of those at Level 1, almost 58% of the eligible voters reported

      voting in a recent state or national election, compared to 80% of those at

      Level 4 and 90% of those at Level 5.&nbsp;<o:p>

      </o:p>

      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">What is the

      significance of the NALS report?</b><span style="font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>

      </o:p>

      </span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>The NALS report does not yield an absolute number of Americans who

      can be termed “illiterate.” Rather, it is the first major scientific

      study to provide a picture of the abilities of American adults to use

      printed material to accomplish day-to-day tasks. The survey found that a

      very large number of people have significantly limited abilities, although

      many of these same people said they felt they could read “well.”&nbsp;<o:p>

      </o:p>

      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>The study also documents the correlation between limited literacy

      skills, limited economic opportunity, and limited participation in

      sociopolitical decisions. The NALS report says “literacy can be thought

      of as a currency in this society. Just as adults with little money have

      difficulty meeting their basic needs, those with limited literacy skills

      are going to find it more challenging to pursue their goals.”&nbsp;<o:p>

      sub-groups thru June 1994. These include reports from the individual

      twelve states, and reports on prison literacy, literacy and the labor

      force, literacy and schooling, literacy and older adults, literacy and

      ethnicity, and literacy and political participation. For further
