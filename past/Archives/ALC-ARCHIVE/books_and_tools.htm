        tool.&nbsp; No charge.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><b>SPELL-WELL</b> (Released in
        November, 2002)&nbsp; This software enables users to enter text into
        MS-Word in normal English Spelling form, or in Phonic form.&nbsp; When
        finished the text material or book can be automatically converted to
        standard English spelling, or to more simplified phonic spelling
        standard that uses letters consistently through the language.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><strong>BEFORE TEACHING THE ABCs</strong> - Audio-visual tool that gives
        children between 3 and 6 a phonics head start. Enables parents or teachers to help
        children learn to write and read by explaining the SOUND of each letter.
        $7</p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><strong>THE GIFT</strong> - A storybook version of O'Henry's &quot;The
        Gift of the Magi&quot;, that provides reading material in an interesting, remedial way.
        The text is printed in parallel lines, black and red, in a way akin to Spell-Well. The
        sound-spelling (i.e. the way the word sounds) appears in red below each word and, unless
        needed for support, is hidden by a movable film overlay. Help is at the reader's
        fingertips. $5</p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><strong>AMERICAN SPELLING DICTIONARY</strong> - An experimental
        dictionary for those interested in spelling. 44,000 words spelled in conventional and
        'American' spelling. This proposal for a simplified, optional spelling is offered in
        response to the complexity of traditional English spelling and its cause-and-effect
        relationship with functional illiteracy. $10</p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><strong>AMERICAN SPELLING MENU</strong> - A PC-based system of word
        lists with programs that enable users to explore a corpus of 44,000 English words for
        spelling frequency and pattern. As with the American Spelling Dictionary, each
        conventional spelling is accompanied by its American equivalent, a simpler spelling based
        on the 26 letters of the alphabet to consistently describe the 42 sounds used when
        speaking English. The system is able to translate common word processing documents from
        conventional spelling to this simpler phonetic spelling. $10</p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><strong>SOUND-SPELLING STARTER KIT -</strong> This kit contains a list
        of 100 words that can be simplified (according to linguists), and a rubber stamp which
        states that the simplified &#145;sound-spellings&#146; are approved, standardized and
        promoted by the ALC. $10</p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><strong>RELATIVE FREQUENCY OF ENGLISH SPELLINGS</strong> - If spelling's
        your thing, this 'must read' by Godfrey Dewey is your book.&nbsp; Based on 100,000 running
        words of printed text, this study provides crucial evidence on the English spelling
        regularities and irregularities with which readers must cope in decoding writing into
        speech (or encoding speech into writing).&nbsp; 142 pp. $10</p>

      <li><p align="left"><strong>ENGLISH SPELLING, ROADBLOCK TO READING</strong> - Godfrey Dewey
        touches on the history of English spelling and ways to improve it.&nbsp; A book about

      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><strong>SPELLING REFORM, A NEW APPROACH</strong> - English spelling
        takes too long to learn and is educationally harmful.&nbsp; For this and other reasons
        author Harry Lindgren says it needs simplifying, and proposes an inconspicuous change
        called SR1: the clear short vowel as in bet is written e.&nbsp; 152 pp.

      <li><p align="left"><strong>SIMPLIFIED SPELLING FOR GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, 1906</strong> -

      <li><p align="left"><strong>WORLD ENGLISH SPELLING (WES) DICTIONARY</strong> - In his
        culmination of a lifetime of research, Godfrey Dewey offers this intriguing phonemic
        notation for English which offers basically one spelling per sound, one pronunciation per
        spelling.&nbsp; It accomplishes this with no new letters, no diacritics, and as little
        disturbance of familiar forms and usage as practicable.&nbsp; 99 pp. $5</p>
