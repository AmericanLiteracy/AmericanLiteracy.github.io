    <p><img src="alcpic1.gif" align="left" hspace="20" width="275" height="160"></p>

      <p>The American Literacy Council is the name of the non-profit organization that undertook

    a serious academic study of our illogical spelling in the early 20th

      century. Today the primary

    activity of the Council is to offer literacy software and other aids that can be used in

    the home, library, or schools for people of all ages having difficulty writing

    and reading. <br>

    <br>

    Since written English does not make consistent use of the simple phonetic assumptions that

    other European languages generally use, software was developed that enables non-readers to

    begin writing by using letters as they experimentally think they might be used. The

    computer instantly corrects these <i>invented spellings,</i> but also speaks the corrected

      spellings audibly

    and clearly thru the multimedia sound card that is typical in desktop and laptop

      PCs.&nbsp;<br>

    <br>

    Department of Education statistics indicate that, in the United States, between one person

    in ten, and one person in five cannot read and write adequately enough to read want ads,

    fill out job application forms, read maps, or read story books to children (see <a href="alc6.htm">Literacy Facts</a>).

      Meanwhile, spelling is not even a school subject in

    Spain, Italy, Germany, Russia or other countries where letters are used with much

    greater consistency to represent spoken sounds. <br>

    <br>

    Computer technology is used by the ALC together with basic phonic principles to guide

    non-readers into a life of active writing and reading. The ALC pioneered and produced the

    product Sound-Write, a computer program that enables students to begin typing

      words, phrases and sentences<img src="alcpic4.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="10" width="185" height="178"> using

    letters to spell words, experimentally at first. (see <a href="software.htm">Software</a>)<br>

    <br>

    As the student tries to type words, each word is instantly corrected to proper English

    spelling by the computer, and the word is also spoken slowly (audibly) so that the

    pronunciation of each syllable is immediately associated with the corrected spelling shown

    on the computer screen. Incorrectly spelled words are displayed below the corrected

      spellings for a brief period and in a different color. Exercise materials and a manual accompany the

    programs. (Downloaded versions provide only a limited number of runs until registration is

    completed with payment of $79.)<br>

    <br>

      Sound-Write can run on networks as well as stand-alone PCs, and with earphones or with a

    speaker. Even without voice output, the program is very useful because an

      optional phonetic

    representation of each word can be displayed using a dependable notation similar to

    phonics notation, but using only the normal letters of the alphabet. <br>

    <br>

    The software has been formally tested at Columbia University ESL labs for effectiveness. It is

    currently in use at Head Start centers, libraries, ESL classrooms, and college

    literacy or learning labs thru-out the country. The program is especially effective in high school labs for use

    by folks having difficulty learning to write or read. <br>

    <br>
