<br>
The topic of Dyslexia and Learning Disabilities covers a number of secondary areas such as slowness in math comprehension, or speech, or printing of letters, or writing, or reading, or recognition of colors or shapes.  Therefore if you are involved in teaching gifted and talented children, or if you provide help for anyone with learning disabilities, you should consider doing your own research on a monthly or quarterly basis.
<br><br>
 Sign up for one or more of the free newsletters (see below) that will keep you posted regarding new methods and new tools.  And if you are a parent trying to educate yourself on this topic, then you too should perform your own research and seek the latest tools and materials that may be helpful.
<br><br>
When you use a search engine to find related materials, over 24 million results will appear, indicating that throughout all the Internet web pages that could be searched, there were 24 million web pages that had been indexed containing the word "Dyslexia."  Perhaps one percent of them are unique sources, but you will want to narrow your searches by using a phrase that more thoughtfully narrows your search, such as "Adult Dyslexia Math" referring to a person who has trouble comprehending the meaning of numbers."
<br><br>
In addition to using multiple words when performing your own research, consider use a service that searches multiple search engines concurrently, then reporting to you results that came from differing search strategies.  Although Google is known for having the most indexed pages, there are services such as  http://DOGPILE.COM that searches Yahoo, Google, ASK, and Live-Search simultaneously.  The results you get are richer and more satisfying to a thoughtful researcher.
<br><br>
The Overture-Yahoo search Engine keep count of all the phrases and words that we users type into the search engines.  For example, we know that last month xxxx people thought to type "XXXX" into various search engines.  A table is shown below that may assist you when you seek specific methods or materials related to Learning Disabilities.  When you glance down through the list you can see words and phrases that you might not have thought of, but which more perfectly match the topic you're researching.
<br><br>
Review this table to help narrow your areas of interest.  The phrases are in descending order.  In other words, 2,206 people thought to type in DISABILITY LEARNING SCHOOL, but only 70 people thought to type in DISABILITY FOUNDATION LEARNING.  All examples are valuable, of course, based on the information you hope to discover.

<A href="http://www.amazon.com/Laughing-Allegra-Inspiring-Struggle-Disabilities/dp/1557046220" target="_blank"> &nbsp;If you have a child with Learning disabilities, "Laughing Allegra" may be of interest. </a> (Clickable Item)<br>

"When Allegra was diagnosed with multiple severe learning disabilities in 1976, there was little or no literature on LD and I was going through this on my own. I needed information to explain my daughter's condition and what I could do to help her, but I also needed a guide to the heart. I needed to connect with someone who had been through it already and could offer words of comfort and the most simple reassuring statement a parent can hear: "Your child will be fine." 
<br><br>
I didn't have that, and that is my reason for writing this book, to enlighten parents and give them hope and help guide them on their oftentimes-treacherous journey. Laughing Allegra is the book I could not find when I needed help. It is not an academic work. I have access to many of the leading experts in the field of learning disabilities, but I have chosen to stay close to my own experience and opinions, not because I discount those of the experts but because my intention is to be the friend across the table, the one who listens and shares lessons learned through similar experiences. It is critical for parents to seek out the advice of teachers, pediatricians, and other experts. At the same time, there is great value in simply knowing that someone else understands exactly what you are going through, feels the same emotions, and has suffered the same doubts and fears.
<br><br>
There are four sections to the book. The first and longest is a memoir of my journey from denial to acceptance, which mirrored Allegra's own from a confused, often lonely child into a young woman of remarkable courage and dedication.
<br><br>
After writing the memoir, I realized there was still more to the story, especially for those whose child has been newly diagnosed. For them, I have included a section called "Questions Parents Ask," which addresses many issues common to parents of children with learning disabilities. These issues range from the most basic question of all, "What is a learning disability?," to questions on a parent's legal rights and how best to navigate the system when problems arise in school. "

<A href="http://www.audiblox2000.com/" target="_blank"> &nbsp;A Multi-sensory Solution for Dyslexia </a> (Clickable Item)<br>
This company has a product named Audiblox.  By use of multi-media, a child is more fully engaged with sights and sounds that supplement the single medium in which their mind signals confusion.  The product claims to be effective for improving concentration, perception, memory , logical thought , sight reading, spelling, handwriting, math, dysgraphia, dyspraxia, and general learning difficulties.
<br><br>
The complimentary Audiblox Dysgraphia Program is recommended for children who suffer from poor handwriting skills, also known as dysgraphia. Dysgraphia often co-exists with dyslexia. This program addresses both problems simultaneously.  Dysgraphia has to do with generally illegible hand printing or writing, letter inconsistencies, mixture of upper/lower case letters or print/cursive letters, irregular letter sizes and shapes, unfinished letters, and a general struggle to use writing as a communications tool.

<A href="http://webquest.org/search/index.php" target="_blank"> &nbsp;Web-Quests for Gifted and Talented Children </a><br>
Since 1996, San Diego State University has maintained a database of example WebQuests. This database is kept up to date and weeded out when a link goes bad (as volunteer time permits). As of this writing, the database contains over 2500 WebQuests. You can search for any string of characters in the Title, Description, Author name or URL, and grade level desired.  
<br><br>
What you get is a topic for students to explore and do research as part of any gifted and talented curriculum.  Since the materials are produced by real teachers, they are well developed and capable of arousing student curiosity and creativity.  Materials of this type are one aspect of the general dyslexia subject and are extremely valuable for any parent or teacher wishing to provide quality challenges and incentives for student personal growth and development.
